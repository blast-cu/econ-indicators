American households and a positive development for policymakers at the Federal Reserve and the White House.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Consumer Price Index <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">climbed 6.5 percent</span> in the year through last month, down <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 7.1 percent</span></span> in the November reading, as prices declined slightly on a monthly basis.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The annual inflation rate was the slowest since <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2021,</span> a pullback that came as gas prices dropped and airfares declined.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Economists and Fed officials are more acutely focused on a so-called core inflation measure, which removes food and fuel prices to get a sense of underlying price trends.</span> That measure <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">climbed 5.7 percent</span> in December from a year earlier, compared <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 6 percent</span> previously and in line with what forecasters had expected.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The takeaway is that inflation is moderating meaningfully.</span> But the key question now is how quickly and how completely it will return to normal after a year and a half of unusually rapid increases, and policymakers are wary that a full deceleration could be a long process.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Several factors should help to slow price increases this year.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">A pullback in goods price inflation is expected to help cool overall inflation this year as supply chains heal.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Climbing rental costs bolstered inflation in December and could continue to push inflation higher for a while, but that is expected to reverse by mid-2023.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Rents for newly leased apartments have begun to climb much more slowly, private data suggests, which will feed into the government\u2019s official inflation measure over time.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">But Fed officials are closely watching what is happening with prices for other services, which include things like hotel rooms, sporting event tickets and health care.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">They worry that services inflation \u2014 which is unusually rapid \u2014 could keep prices increasing faster than the central bank\u2019s target.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The Fed aims <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 2 percent</span> inflation on average, using a price measure that is different from but related to the Consumer Price Index.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">To cool conditions, central bankers have been raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive for companies and households in a bid to slow demand and the broader economy.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">For the Federal Reserve, the inflation report on Thursday confirmed that the slowdown in price gains that officials have been expecting is coming to fruition.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Given that, the figures could help policymakers feel comfortable downshifting the pace of interest rate increases.</span> Officials slowed their rate moves in December and have made it clear that they may dial them back further in February \u2014 adjusting policy a quarter point (also referred to <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 25 basis</span> points) at a time, instead of continuing with the more aggressive adjustments they made <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2022.</span>\n\u201cI expect that we will raise rates a few more times this year, though, to my mind, the days of us raising <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">them 75 basis</span> points at a time have surely passed,\u201d Patrick Harker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said in a speech on Thursday. \u201cIn my view, hikes <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 25 basis</span> points will be appropriate going forward.\u201d\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">But the fresh inflation data does little to suggest that the problem of rapid price increases has been fully solved, so central bankers are likely to raise borrowing costs slightly more over the coming months and then leave the rates elevated for some time to fully wrestle inflation under control.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Core services prices excluding housing costs, a measure that both the Fed and economists are watching closely, picked <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 0.3 percent</span> in December on a monthly basis.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">That was up <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 0.1 percent</span> in November, according to calculations by Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is made a pivot from goods inflation,\u201d Mr. Harker said in a question-and-answer session following his speech.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cService inflation ex-shelter is still running really high.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Many central bankers think that to get services inflation under control, they need to slow the job market and tamp down wage gains.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Otherwise, companies facing larger labor bills are likely to continue passing along those costs to consumers.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe biggest cost, by far, in that sector is labor,\u201d Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at his latest news conference in December.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">\u201cAnd we do see a very, very strong labor market, one where we haven\u2019t seen much softening, where job growth is very high, where wages are very high.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Fed policymakers first slowed interest rates increases in December after a series of rapid moves earlier in the year, and seem poised to slow them further at their next meeting on Feb.<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span></span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">But they still expect to raise rates at least slightly more and then keep them high until they see convincing evidence that price increases are moderating, even if that inflicts some economic damage.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019re really moving into an era of higher nominal interest rates for quite a while,\u201d James Bullard, the president of the St. Louis Fed, said at an event on Thursday.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">He said that the inflation report was encouraging, but that markets were too optimistic that inflation would swiftly slow.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Understand Inflation and How It Affects You\n- Federal Reserve: Federal Reserve officials kicked <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">off 2023 by</span> grappling with a thorny question: How should central bankers understand inflation <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 18 months</span> of repeatedly misjudging it?\n- Social Security: The cost-of-living adjustment, which helps the benefit keep pace with inflation, is set <span

inflation lower in December, contributing to the Consumer Price Index\u2019s slowest annual increase in more than a year.</span> <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Digging into the numbers, prices for some goods are beginning to pull back as supply chains heal and demand for things wanes \u2014 even as gains for many services remain unusually strong.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Here\u2019s what to know about the December inflation report:\nOverall inflation cooled <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 6.5 percent</span> in December on a yearly basis, down <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 7.1 percent</span></span> in November.\n</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">After stripping out food and fuel prices, which are volatile, the core price index was <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 5.7 percent</span> over the past year, a moderation <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 6 percent</span> in November.</span> On a monthly basis, that core measure picked up, though: It climbed <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 0.3 percent</span></span> compared with November, in line with expectations but quicker than the previous reading. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">That suggests inflation has some underlying staying power.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">One of the big categories that dragged down overall inflation was gas, which fell sharply in price in December.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Energy prices overall were <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down<span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4.5 percent</span></span> on a monthly basis.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Food prices <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 0.3 percent</span>, a slight slowdown from earlier readings, although some products saw huge increases, like eggs, up <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 11 percent</span> in December alone.\n</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Rent continued to rise, putting upward pressure on inflation.</span> Shelter costs climbed sharply over the month, with rent of primary residences jumping <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 0.8 percent</span>. <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">Economists expect those price gains to slow <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2023.</span></span></span>\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">Prices for goods are also expected to climb more slowly \u2014 or decline outright \u2014 as supply chains heal and consumers stop buying so many couches and coffee machines.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">Used cars and trucks, a big driver of inflation early on, became cheaper last month, and new cars also declined slightly in price.</span> <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">But apparel prices, which many economists had expected to show a marked slowdown in December, instead rose.\n</span><span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">Services costs could help to keep inflation higher than normal.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Wage gains are rapid, and Federal Reserve officials are worried that this will prompt service providers \u2014 like hotels and day-care centers \u2014 to keep raising prices.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">December\u2019s report showed increases in prices including sporting event admissions and pet services.\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">Food prices, one of the most visible signs of inflation for consumers, continued to rise in December, albeit at a slower pace than recent months.\n</span><span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">Food prices rose <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 0.3 percent</span></span> in December versus the previous month, down from monthly gains <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 0.5 percent</span> in November <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 0.6 percent</span> in October.\n</span><span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">Food prices overall were <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 10.4 percent</span> over the past year.</span> <span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">The cost of food at restaurants rose at <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an 8.3 percent</span> annual pace, while food at grocery stores <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">became 11.4 percent</span> more expensive.\n</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">Rising food prices have weighed heavily on American consumers as they grapple with the high cost of many other goods and services.</span> <span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">Some have had to make changes to their grocery shopping routines to accommodate the cost of food, cutting out certain types of meat and switching to lower-priced grocery stores.\n</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">An outbreak of avian influenza, also known as the bird flu, has caused the prices of eggs to surge, recording a gain of more <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 11 percent</span> in December, versus the month before.</span> <span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">In other breakfast staples, the price of cereal rose<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span>1 percent, bacon <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 2.9 percent</span> and the cost of biscuits, rolls and muffins was unchanged.</span> <span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">The price of oranges dipped<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span>7 percent from the previous month as suppliers continued to recover from hurricane damage to Florida crops last fall.\n</span><span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">President Biden celebrated Thursday\u2019s report showing that consumer prices receded in December, saying inflation is \u201ccoming down in America month after month\u201d even as it remains high in major economies around the world.\n</span><span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">In remarks that lacked some of his typical cautions about how far the economy still has to go to recover, Mr. Biden cheered falling gasoline prices, slowing food inflation and falling core inflation \u2014 which strips out food and energy prices.</span> <span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">He claimed progress on the economic issue that has most bedeviled his presidency.\n</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt all adds up to a real break for consumers, real breathing room for families and more proof that my economic plan is working,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n</span><span id=\"59\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden has expressed increasing optimism in recent months that the economy can achieve a so-called soft landing that avoids a recession \u2014 with inflation cooling and growth slowing, as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to help tame price growth.</span> <span id=\"60\" class=\"red\">He has repeatedly pointed to the strength of the job market as a sign that the nation is nowhere near an economic downturn.\n</span><span id=\"61\" class=\"red\">Republicans continued to blame Mr. Biden for high inflation, particularly the trillions of dollars in new spending he signed into law for pandemic relief, infrastructure and more.</span> They used the report on Thursday as new fuel for a House Republican push to cut federal spending in the year ahead.\n<span id=\"62\" class=\"red\">\u201cOut-of-control Washington spending got Americans and our economy into this mess,\u201d Representative Jason Smith of Missouri, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said in a news release.</span> \u201cCongress owes it to the American people to confront the crisis head-on.\u201d\n<span id=\"63\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden took his new Republican opponents head on in his remarks, promising to veto their plans to reduce funding for I.R.S. enforcement and replace the federal income tax with a national sales tax \u2014 which Mr. Biden said would cut taxes for the wealthy while raising them for the middle class.\n</span><span id=\"64\" class=\"red\">S&<span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500\nThe</span> stock market wobbled on Thursday morning as investors reacted to fresh data that showed price increases slowed in December but in some corners of the economy, inflation remains stubbornly high.\n</span><span id=\"65\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 stock</span> index fluctuated between small gains and losses in early trading.</span> The index had posted a<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span>9 percent gain for the week through Wednesday.\n<span id=\"66\" class=\"red\">Despite the latest reading of consumer inflation cooling as expected, investors noted that the numbers were driven by a continued drop in used car prices and a sharp drop in energy costs, while price pressures in some parts of the economy driven by consumer demand remained strong.</span> Buying clothes, drinking alcohol, getting a haircut and staying in a hotel became more expensive. <span id=\"67\" class=\"red\">Airline prices fell in December but remained <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 29 percent</span> higher compared with a year ago.\n</span><span id=\"68\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s not what the Federal Reserve wants to see because it suggests consumers are still willing to pay higher prices, hinting at the robust jobs market and wage gains that are making the Fed\u2019s job of lowering inflation harder.</span> <span id=\"69\" class=\"red\">As a result, the Fed may need to continue raising interest rates and keep them at a high level for an extended period of time, increasing costs for companies and weighing on stock markets.\n</span><span id=\"70\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe risks to inflation remaining resilient mostly stem from wage gains,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments.</span> \u201cWhat we see today is that may be the case. <span id=\"71\" class=\"red\">The Fed will be worried about that.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"72\" class=\"red\">Still, investors have been encouraged in recent months by signs that inflation is moderating and by the Fed\u2019s response in December to slow the pace of interest rate increases.\n</span><span id=\"73\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 has</span> risen more <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 3 percent</span> so far this year, after suffering <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 20 percent</span> fall last year, its worst annual performance <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2008.</span>\n</span><span id=\"74\" class=\"red\">Some investors pointed to the high cost of rent, which typically takes a while to catch up with changes in the economy, skewing inflation higher.</span> <span id=\"75\" class=\"red\">Housing costs make up a big chunk of the overall Consumer Price Index.\n</span><span id=\"76\" class=\"red\">The latest numbers were enough to solidify investors\u2019 expectations of a further slowdown in the Fed\u2019s next increase in interest rates, <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 0.25 percentage</span> points, down from <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 0.5 percentage</span> point increase in December.</span> <span id=\"77\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s key policy rate is currently set in a range <span id=\"75\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 4.25 to</span><span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4.5 percent</span>.\n</span><span id=\"78\" class=\"red\">The yield on two-year U.S. government bonds, which is sensitive to changes in Fed policy, fell on Thursday <span id=\"77\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 4.17 percent</span> from a peak <span id=\"78\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 4.72 percent</span> in November, but trading remained choppy.</span> The U.S. dollar also dropped.\n<span id=\"79\" class=\"red\">Worries remain in markets over how long the Fed will need to keep interest rates elevated to slow inflation; the longer interest rates stay high, the more pressure they put on company costs, and the higher the risk that the economy slips into recession.\n</span>\u201cWe think any rally here based on the C.P.I. report will be temporary,\u201d said Mary Ann Bartels, chief investment strategist at Sanctuary Wealth. <span id=\"80\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe have months if not quarters ahead of us where we need to see much lower levels of inflation, and we think we will get there</span> but it\u2019s going to take time.\u201d\nIsabella Simonetti contributed reporting.",

American households and a positive development for policymakers at the Federal Reserve and the White House.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Consumer Price Index <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">climbed 6.5 percent</span> in the year through last month, down <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 7.1 percent</span></span> in the November reading, as prices declined slightly on a monthly basis.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The annual inflation rate was the slowest since <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2021,</span> a pullback that came as gas prices dropped and airfares declined.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Economists and Fed officials are more acutely focused on a so-called core inflation measure, which removes food and fuel prices to get a sense of underlying price trends.</span> That measure <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">climbed 5.7 percent</span> in December from a year earlier, compared <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 6 percent</span> previously and in line with what forecasters had expected.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The takeaway is that inflation is moderating meaningfully.</span> But the key question now is how quickly and how completely it will return to normal after a year and a half of unusually rapid increases, and policymakers are wary that a full deceleration could be a long process.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Several factors should help to slow price increases this year.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">A pullback in goods price inflation is expected to help cool overall inflation this year as supply chains heal.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Climbing rental costs bolstered inflation in December and could continue to push inflation higher for a while, but that is expected to reverse by mid-2023.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Rents for newly leased apartments have begun to climb much more slowly, private data suggests, which will feed into the government\u2019s official inflation measure over time.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">But Fed officials are closely watching what is happening with prices for other services, which include things like hotel rooms, sporting event tickets and health care.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">They worry that services inflation \u2014 which is unusually rapid \u2014 could keep prices increasing faster than the central bank\u2019s target.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The Fed aims <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 2 percent</span> inflation on average, using a price measure that is different from but related to the Consumer Price Index.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">To cool conditions, central bankers have been raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive for companies and households in a bid to slow demand and the broader economy.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">For the Federal Reserve, the inflation report on Thursday confirmed that the slowdown in price gains that officials have been expecting is coming to fruition.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Given that, the figures could help policymakers feel comfortable downshifting the pace of interest rate increases.</span> Officials slowed their rate moves in December and have made it clear that they may dial them back further in February \u2014 adjusting policy a quarter point (also referred to <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 25 basis</span> points) at a time, instead of continuing with the more aggressive adjustments they made <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2022.</span>\n\u201cI expect that we will raise rates a few more times this year, though, to my mind, the days of us raising <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">them 75 basis</span> points at a time have surely passed,\u201d Patrick Harker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said in a speech on Thursday. \u201cIn my view, hikes <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 25 basis</span> points will be appropriate going forward.\u201d\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">But the fresh inflation data does little to suggest that the problem of rapid price increases has been fully solved, so central bankers are likely to raise borrowing costs slightly more over the coming months and then leave the rates elevated for some time to fully wrestle inflation under control.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Core services prices excluding housing costs, a measure that both the Fed and economists are watching closely, picked <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 0.3 percent</span> in December on a monthly basis.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">That was up <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 0.1 percent</span> in November, according to calculations by Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is made a pivot from goods inflation,\u201d Mr. Harker said in a question-and-answer session following his speech.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cService inflation ex-shelter is still running really high.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Many central bankers think that to get services inflation under control, they need to slow the job market and tamp down wage gains.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Otherwise, companies facing larger labor bills are likely to continue passing along those costs to consumers.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe biggest cost, by far, in that sector is labor,\u201d Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at his latest news conference in December.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">\u201cAnd we do see a very, very strong labor market, one where we haven\u2019t seen much softening, where job growth is very high, where wages are very high.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Fed policymakers first slowed interest rates increases in December after a series of rapid moves earlier in the year, and seem poised to slow them further at their next meeting on Feb.<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span></span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">But they still expect to raise rates at least slightly more and then keep them high until they see convincing evidence that price increases are moderating, even if that inflicts some economic damage.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019re really moving into an era of higher nominal interest rates for quite a while,\u201d James Bullard, the president of the St. Louis Fed, said at an event on Thursday.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">He said that the inflation report was encouraging, but that markets were too optimistic that inflation would swiftly slow.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Understand Inflation and How It Affects You\n- Federal Reserve: Federal Reserve officials kicked <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\"

inflation lower in December, contributing to the Consumer Price Index\u2019s slowest annual increase in more than a year.</span> <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Digging into the numbers, prices for some goods are beginning to pull back as supply chains heal and demand for things wanes \u2014 even as gains for many services remain unusually strong.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Here\u2019s what to know about the December inflation report:\nOverall inflation cooled <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 6.5 percent</span> in December on a yearly basis, down <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 7.1 percent</span></span> in November.\n</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">After stripping out food and fuel prices, which are volatile, the core price index was <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 5.7 percent</span> over the past year, a moderation <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 6 percent</span> in November.</span> On a monthly basis, that core measure picked up, though: It climbed <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 0.3 percent</span></span> compared with November, in line with expectations but quicker than the previous reading. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">That suggests inflation has some underlying staying power.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">One of the big categories that dragged down overall inflation was gas, which fell sharply in price in December.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Energy prices overall were <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down<span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4.5 percent</span></span> on a monthly basis.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Food prices <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 0.3 percent</span>, a slight slowdown from earlier readings, although some products saw huge increases, like eggs, up <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 11 percent</span> in December alone.\n</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Rent continued to rise, putting upward pressure on inflation.</span> Shelter costs climbed sharply over the month, with rent of primary residences jumping <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 0.8 percent</span>. <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">Economists expect those price gains to slow <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2023.</span></span></span>\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">Prices for goods are also expected to climb more slowly \u2014 or decline outright \u2014 as supply chains heal and consumers stop buying so many couches and coffee machines.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">Used cars and trucks, a big driver of inflation early on, became cheaper last month, and new cars also declined slightly in price.</span> <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">But apparel prices, which many economists had expected to show a marked slowdown in December, instead rose.\n</span><span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">Services costs could help to keep inflation higher than normal.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Wage gains are rapid, and Federal Reserve officials are worried that this will prompt service providers \u2014 like hotels and day-care centers \u2014 to keep raising prices.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">December\u2019s report showed increases in prices including sporting event admissions and pet services.\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">Food prices, one of the most visible signs of inflation for consumers, continued to rise in December, albeit at a slower pace than recent months.\n</span><span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">Food prices rose <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 0.3 percent</span></span> in December versus the previous month, down from monthly gains <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 0.5 percent</span> in November <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 0.6 percent</span> in October.\n</span><span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">Food prices overall were <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 10.4 percent</span> over the past year.</span> <span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">The cost of food at restaurants rose at <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an 8.3 percent</span> annual pace, while food at grocery stores <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">became 11.4 percent</span> more expensive.\n</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">Rising food prices have weighed heavily on American consumers as they grapple with the high cost of many other goods and services.</span> <span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">Some have had to make changes to their grocery shopping routines to accommodate the cost of food, cutting out certain types of meat and switching to lower-priced grocery stores.\n</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">An outbreak of avian influenza, also known as the bird flu, has caused the prices of eggs to surge, recording a gain of more <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 11 percent</span> in December, versus the month before.</span> <span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">In other breakfast staples, the price of cereal rose<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span>1 percent, bacon <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 2.9 percent</span> and the cost of biscuits, rolls and muffins was unchanged.</span> <span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">The price of oranges dipped<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span>7 percent from the previous month as suppliers continued to recover from hurricane damage to Florida crops last fall.\n</span><span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">President Biden celebrated Thursday\u2019s report showing that consumer prices receded in December, saying inflation is \u201ccoming down in America month after month\u201d even as it remains high in major economies around the world.\n</span><span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">In remarks that lacked some of his typical cautions about how far the economy still has to go to recover, Mr. Biden cheered falling gasoline prices, slowing food inflation and falling core inflation \u2014 which strips out food and energy prices.</span> <span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">He claimed progress on the economic issue that has most bedeviled his presidency.\n</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt all adds up to a real break for consumers, real breathing room for families and more proof that my economic plan is working,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n</span><span id=\"59\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden has expressed increasing optimism in recent months that the economy can achieve a so-called soft landing that avoids a recession \u2014 with inflation cooling and growth slowing, as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to help tame price growth.</span> <span id=\"60\" class=\"red\">He has repeatedly pointed to the strength of the job market as a sign that the nation is nowhere near an economic downturn.\n</span><span id=\"61\" class=\"red\">Republicans continued to blame Mr. Biden for high inflation, particularly the trillions of dollars in new spending he signed into law for pandemic relief, infrastructure and more.</span> They used the report on Thursday as new fuel for a House Republican push to cut federal spending in the year ahead.\n<span id=\"62\" class=\"red\">\u201cOut-of-control Washington spending got Americans and our economy into this mess,\u201d Representative Jason Smith of Missouri, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said in a news release.</span> \u201cCongress owes it to the American people to confront the crisis head-on.\u201d\n<span id=\"63\" class=\"red\">Mr. Biden took his new Republican opponents head on in his remarks, promising to veto their plans to reduce funding for I.R.S. enforcement and replace the federal income tax with a national sales tax \u2014 which Mr. Biden said would cut taxes for the wealthy while raising them for the middle class.\n</span><span id=\"64\" class=\"red\">S&<span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500\nThe</span> stock market wobbled on Thursday morning as investors reacted to fresh data that showed price increases slowed in December but in some corners of the economy, inflation remains stubbornly high.\n</span><span id=\"65\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\"

onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span>9 percent gain for the week through Wednesday.\n<span id=\"66\" class=\"red\">Despite the latest reading of consumer inflation cooling as expected, investors noted that the numbers were driven by a continued drop in used car prices and a sharp drop in energy costs, while price pressures in some parts of the economy driven by consumer demand remained strong.</span> Buying clothes, drinking alcohol, getting a haircut and staying in a hotel became more expensive. <span id=\"67\" class=\"red\">Airline prices fell in December but remained <span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 29 percent</span> higher compared with a year ago.\n</span><span id=\"68\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s not what the Federal Reserve wants to see because it suggests consumers are still willing to pay higher prices, hinting at the robust jobs market and wage gains that are making the Fed\u2019s job of lowering inflation harder.</span> <span id=\"69\" class=\"red\">As a result, the Fed may need to continue raising interest rates and keep them at a high level for an extended period of time, increasing costs for companies and weighing on stock markets.\n</span><span id=\"70\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe risks to inflation remaining resilient mostly stem from wage gains,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments.</span> \u201cWhat we see today is that may be the case. <span id=\"71\" class=\"red\">The Fed will be worried about that.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"72\" class=\"red\">Still, investors have been encouraged in recent months by signs that inflation is moderating and by the Fed\u2019s response in December to slow the pace of interest rate increases.\n</span><span id=\"73\" class=\"red\">The S&<span id=\"69\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 has</span> risen more <span id=\"70\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 3 percent</span> so far this year, after suffering <span id=\"71\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 20 percent</span> fall last year, its worst annual performance <span id=\"72\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2008.</span>\n</span><span id=\"74\" class=\"red\">Some investors pointed to the high cost of rent, which typically takes a while to catch up with changes in the economy, skewing inflation higher.</span> <span id=\"75\" class=\"red\">Housing costs make up a big chunk of the overall Consumer Price Index.\n</span><span id=\"76\" class=\"red\">The latest numbers were enough to solidify investors\u2019 expectations of a further slowdown in the Fed\u2019s next increase in interest rates, <span id=\"73\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 0.25 percentage</span> points, down from <span id=\"74\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 0.5 percentage</span> point increase in December.</span> <span id=\"77\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s key policy rate is currently set in a range <span id=\"75\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 4.25 to</span><span id=\"76\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4.5 percent</span>.\n</span><span id=\"78\" class=\"red\">The yield on two-year U.S. government bonds, which is sensitive to changes in Fed

percent</span> in November, but trading remained choppy.</span> The U.S. dollar also dropped.\n<span id=\"79\" class=\"red\">Worries remain in markets over how long the Fed will need to keep interest

to testify on monetary policy, his first public appearance since being sworn in as the central bank\u2019s new leader.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Powell Sees the Fed Sticking With Its Current Policy Tools\nRep. Jeb Hensarling Puts Down a Marker Ahead of Jerome Powell's Testimony\nSome See in Powell Testimony a Reason to be Hawkish on Rates\nThe Fed's Concern on Cryptocurrencies\nA Closer Look at Wage Growth\nMarkets Shrug Off Jerome Powell's Testimony\nCongressman Jeb Hensarling opened the hearing by asking Mr. Powell about whether the Fed is going to stick with using its current interest-rate setting tool, the ability to pay banks interest on their excess reserves.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">This has only been the Fed's principal policy tool in the last couple of years.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The Fed used to control rates through open market operations.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell said that for now the Fed is sticking with interest on excess reserves: \"We have not made a decision in the longer-run whether that will continue to be our framework or if we\u2019ll return to something more like before the crisis,\" he said.</span> \"This is not a near-term decision\" and \"our current approach seems to be working well.<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\"\nRep. Jeb Hensarling starts off his statement ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's by marking some territory.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">While he told Mr. Powell, \"We are all rooting for you, because much is at stake,\" he nevertheless said the Fed needs to do a better job communicating its policies.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">He also the Fed \"must stay in its lane\" and not undertake monetary policy strategies that are more appropriately done by Congress.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Mr. Hensarling also said key aspects of how the Fed manages interest rates now, namely its power to pay banks interest on reserves, are problematic and could compromise the Fed's independence if central bankers stick with this strategy.\n</span>Mr. Powell is walking into the room now for his first congressional testimony. We're still probably a bit away from when things get interesting. First, lots of photos, and then opening statements from the House committeee leaders, and then Mr. Powell will read his testimony. (Ms. Yellen used to eat up time in the hearing with a slow verbatim reading of the already-released written testimony; to be fair, many Congress members show up to the hearings having apparently not yet read it.) Typically, the questioning starts <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 20 minutes</span> from now.\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Some observers of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony today see it as a reason to affirm their hawkish views on monetary policy.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">While Fed officials penciled in three rate rises <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 2018 in</span> their most recent forecasts, some now reckon a strong economy, juiced by fiscal policy, could drive the Fed to raise rates four times this year.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell hinted \"at the upside potential for inflation and the increasing positives for growth suggest the risks are skewed towards a more aggressive monetary policy response,\" said analysts at ING.</span> In light of the strong outlook, \"we are now forecasting four rate rises this year. We look for one every quarter starting with the <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 21 FOMC</span> meeting,\" the firm said. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Capital Economics is also on board for four hikes and called a March move \"a near-certainty.</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">\"\nThe idea that the Fed will boost its short-term rate target in March is indeed a pretty safe bet.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">In a recent television interview, Federal Reserve Bank of New York leader William Dudley said \"as long as I\u2019m comfortable that the economy is going to continue to grow at an above-trend pace at a time that I think monetary policy is accommodative and financial conditions are easy, I\u2019m probably going to be supportive of removing monetary policy accommodation\" at the upcoming meeting.\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">After that, though, it will come down to Fed officials to signal a shift, which they could of course do in March.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">That meeting will include an update of their interest rate and economic forecast.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The case for a more aggressive path is building: Inflation is likely to move up toward <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2% inflation</span> target, in part because of favorable arithmetic relative to last year's unexpectedly weak readings.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The job market remains very strong.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Also, Fed officials are increasing taking on board the positive economic impact of recent tax cuts and government spending increases, even as they worry this stimulus is ill-timed for an economy that's already growing strongly.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Fed officials normally are reluctant to publicly spot bubbles, but last week, New York Fed President William Dudley pointed the finger at one.\n</span>Mr. Dudley says there appears to be a \"speculative mania around cryptocurrencies in terms of thier valuations, which I view as pretty dangerous, because I don\u2019t really see what the actual true underlying value of some of these cryptocurrencies actually is in practice.\"\nIf asked about cryptocurrencies, it will be interesting to see if Mr. Powell shares Mr. Dudley's assessment.\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley warned there\u2019s considerable danger and risk right now around the rise of so-called cryptocurrencies that seek to supplant the U.S. dollar.\n<span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Read Full Article\nMr. Powell's comments on wage growth could be a key focus of his testimony today.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">While we wait for the hearing to start, here's a closer look at what's been happening with wage growth recently:\nThere are reasons for caution: It hit just pockets of the labor market and previous breakouts have been short-lived.\n</span>Read Full Article\nThe writers of Wall Street research notes always love a good classic-rock lyric as a short and sweet way to sum up an issue. <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">And so it goes for Jerome Powell's first-ever testimony as Fed chairman.\n</span>BMO Capital Markets strategist Ian Lyngen goes straight for The Who in summing up Mr. Powell's testimony: \"Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.<span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">\"\n\"While we've used that lyrical reference in the past, we think it does a great job summarizing\" what the chairman is slated to say today and the continuity of his views relative to former Fed leader Janet Yellen, Mr. Lyngen wrote.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">For comparison, here's our coverage of the two recent speeches from Randal Quarles, the Fed's vice chair of supervision: yesterday's speech and last week's speech.</span> Indeed, a lot of similarities.\n<span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Markets have largely brushed off the release of Jerome Powell's prewritten testimony, which showed the new Fed chair plans to stick to a gradual path for interest-rate increases.\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">The yield on the 10-year Treasury was little changed from before the release, recently <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 2.87%,</span> while the dollar edged <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 0.1%.</span></span> S&P futures <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">slipped 0.2%.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">BMO Capital Markets analysts say the muted market reaction suggests Mr. Powell's testimony is a \"fully priced-in event.</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">\"\nStill, his Q&A session later this morning will be closely watched by investors for any new clues on how Mr. Powell is thinking about growth, inflation and interest rates.\n</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">One of the big questions about new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony today is one of style.</span> The last two central bank leaders, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, were both top-tier academics. <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Their style of communication could often skew toward ivory-tower economics, although both of those leaders were models of clarity compared with the deliberately obtuse language of Alan Greenspan.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell isn't an economist, and has a strong background in finance.</span> There's some expectation that Mr. Powell will skew toward shorter and more plain-spoken answers to the questions legislators send his way. <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">He's seen as less likely to dive into the technicalities of economic issues.</span> It'll be an interesting test to see whether such a style helps Mr. Powell, should he choose to speak more plainly. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">After all, the Fed does believe its policies are more effective when they are broadly understood.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Setting Fed interest-rate policy based on rules has become a bit of a flash point between Congress and the Fed.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">A good number of legislators would like to see the central bank make rate policy based on some sort of rule, something most Fed officials have long pushed back against.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">In his first-ever testimony as Fed leader, Jerome Powell told Congress, \"I find these rule prescriptions helpful.\"</span> But they're not the whole story: \"Careful judgments are required about the measurement of the variables used, as well as about the implications of the many issues these rules do not take into account,\" he said in his prepared remarks.\nFor Mr. Powell, that view represents continuity with the his predecessors.\n<span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">One more message from his testimony : Mr. Powell doesn't expect the factors weighing down inflation to repeat themselves.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">He will tell lawmakers that he expects inflation to move up this year and stabilize around the Fed\u2019<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2% objective</span> \u201cover the medium term,\u201d and that \u201cwages should increase at a faster pace as well.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">After running below the Fed\u2019s target for years, recent economic data suggests price pressures are finally starting to firm.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell noted monthly inflation readings were \u201ca little higher\u201d at the end <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2017 than</span> earlier months, and said he continues to view the inflation shortfall as \u201clikely reflecting transitory influences that we do not expect will repeat.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">After years of lackluster wage growth, Americans may soon see faster increases in the size of their paychecks, he said.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">Wages have continued to grow moderately since the middle <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2017,</span> \u201cwith a modest acceleration in some measures,\u201d though weak productivity growth in recent years has likely damped some of the pickup in wages, he said.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Given the strong economic outlook, Mr. Powell said \"wages should increase at a faster pace as well.\u201d\nMr. Powell sounded an optimistic note about the U.S. economy in his prepared testimony Tuesday, noting that \u201csome of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">In particular, he noted, fiscal policy has become more stimulative, and foreign demand for U.S. exports \u201cis on a firmer trajectory,\u201d providing \u201cconsiderable\u201d support for the manufacturing sector.\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">He said he also expects upbeat sentiment to support continued growth in business investment, and that a strong labor market will bolster household incomes and spending growth.\n</span><span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">\u201cIndeed, the economic outlook remains strong,\u201d he said.\n</span><span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell's testimony is pretty sanguine about the market's recent wobbles, saying: \u201cat this point, we do not see these developments as weighing heavily on the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation.</span><span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">\"\nFed officials have worried in the past that high and rising equity prices could inflate a new stock-market bubble.</span> <span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">The return of market volatility could actually ease those concerns somewhat, as could rising yields on government debt, as they make the market look less \"bubbly.</span>\"\nMr. Powell's prewritten testimony has been released! <span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">Here's the key takeaway from our colleague David Harrison:\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress Tuesday the central bank remains on track to gradually raise short-term interest rates to keep the economy on an even keel amid strengthening growth and inflation.\n</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe economic outlook remains strong,\u201d he said.</span> \u201cFurther gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment of both of our objectives.\u201d\n<span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">A new flashpoint in the debate over the Federal Reserve's postcrisis monetary policies was opened up just last week, when a group of leading economists published a paper at a premier economics conference, arguing that the Fed's quantitative easing policies were largely ineffective.\n</span><span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">The original concern that many had with the Fed's large-scale bond-buying , known as QE for short, was that it would spur runaway inflation and weaken the U.S. dollar.</span> Nothing of the sort happened; rather, it's hard to prove that QE did much of anything at all.\n<span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">Although the Fed is clearly in tightening mode right now, it will be interesting to hear if Mr. Powell shares any of this skepticism about one of the Fed's major policies over the past decade.</span> <span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">Any commentary from Mr. Powell could provide hints about how the Fed would react during the next downturn.\n</span><span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">Read more here:\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s signature bond buying stimulus program undertaken during and in the wake of the financial

to hear from the Federal Reserve about its unprecedented decision, on Janet Yellen's final day in office, to drop the hammer on Wells Fargo & Co.\nBefore leaving the building, Ms. Yellen signed off on extensive penalties for the \"widespread consumer abuses\" at Wells Fargo that were announced in the evening of her final Friday.</span> <span id=\"59\" class=\"red\">The Fed announced that Wells Fargo would be replacing four members of its board of directors and took action to limit the ability of Wells Fargo to grow.</span> <span id=\"60\" class=\"red\">On the first day of trading after the announcement, Wells Fargo <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 7.8%.</span>\n</span><span id=\"61\" class=\"red\">And just like that, Ms. Yellen was done at the Fed.</span> Congress is likely to have some questions about what went down at this 11th hour (and 59th minute) move against one of America's largest banks.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s unprecedented move to handcuff growth at Wells Fargo sent a strong message to boards of directors and contributed to the bank\u2019s shares falling sharply Monday.\nRead Full Article\n<span id=\"62\"

convulsions, the renewed embrace in the U.S. of major deficit spending, and whether inflation is poised to pick up.\n</span><span id=\"65\" class=\"red\">Another theme to watch is whether Mr. Powell signals a pivot in the Fed's approach toward regulation, as this is thought by some to be an area where he might have disagreed with Ms. Yellen's approach.\n</span>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome

of Alan Greenspan.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell isn't an economist, and has a strong background in finance.</span> There's some expectation that Mr. Powell will skew toward shorter and more plain-spoken answers to the questions legislators send his way. <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">He's seen as less likely to dive into the technicalities of economic issues.</span> It'll be an interesting test to see whether such a style helps Mr. Powell, should he choose to speak more plainly. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">After all, the Fed does believe its policies are more effective when they are broadly understood.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Setting Fed interest-rate policy based on rules has become a bit of a flash point between Congress and the Fed.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">A good number of legislators would like to see the central bank make rate policy based on some sort of rule, something most Fed officials have long pushed back against.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">In his first-ever testimony as Fed leader, Jerome Powell told Congress, \"I find these rule prescriptions helpful.\"</span> But they're not the whole story: \"Careful judgments are required about the measurement of the variables used, as well as about the implications of the many issues these rules do not take into account,\" he said in his prepared remarks.\nFor Mr. Powell, that view represents continuity with the his predecessors.\n<span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">One more message from his testimony : Mr. Powell doesn't expect the factors weighing down inflation to repeat themselves.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">He will tell lawmakers that he expects inflation to move up this year and stabilize around the Fed\u2019<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2% objective</span> \u201cover the medium term,\u201d and that \u201cwages should increase at a faster pace as well.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">After running below the Fed\u2019s target for years, recent economic data suggests price pressures are finally starting to firm.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell noted monthly inflation readings were \u201ca little higher\u201d at the end <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2017 than</span> earlier months, and said he continues to view the inflation shortfall as \u201clikely reflecting transitory influences that we do not expect will repeat.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">After years of lackluster wage growth, Americans may soon see faster increases in the size of their paychecks, he said.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">Wages have continued to grow moderately since the middle <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2017,</span> \u201cwith a modest acceleration in some measures,\u201d though weak productivity growth in recent years has likely damped some of the pickup in wages, he said.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Given the strong economic outlook, Mr. Powell said \"wages should increase at a faster pace as well.\u201d\nMr. Powell sounded an optimistic note about the U.S. economy in his prepared testimony Tuesday, noting that \u201csome of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">In particular, he noted, fiscal policy has become more stimulative, and foreign demand for U.S. exports \u201cis on a firmer trajectory,\u201d providing \u201cconsiderable\u201d support for the manufacturing sector.\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">He said he also expects upbeat sentiment to support continued growth in business investment, and that a strong labor market will bolster household incomes and spending growth.\n</span><span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">\u201cIndeed, the economic outlook remains strong,\u201d he said.\n</span><span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell's testimony is pretty sanguine about the market's recent wobbles, saying: \u201cat this point, we do not see these developments as weighing heavily on the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation.</span><span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">\"\nFed officials have worried in the past that high and rising equity prices could inflate a new stock-market bubble.</span> <span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">The return of market volatility could actually ease those concerns somewhat, as could rising yields on government debt, as they make the market look less \"bubbly.</span>\"\nMr. Powell's prewritten testimony has been released! <span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">Here's the key takeaway from our colleague David Harrison:\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress Tuesday the central bank remains on track to gradually raise short-term interest rates to keep the economy on an even keel amid strengthening growth and inflation.\n</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe economic outlook remains strong,\u201d he said.</span> \u201cFurther gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment of both of our objectives.\u201d\n<span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">A new flashpoint in the debate over the Federal Reserve's postcrisis monetary policies was opened up just last week, when a group of leading economists published a paper at a premier economics conference, arguing that the Fed's quantitative easing policies were largely ineffective.\n</span><span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">The original concern that many had with the Fed's large-scale bond-buying , known as QE for short, was that it would spur runaway inflation and weaken the U.S. dollar.</span> Nothing of the sort happened; rather, it's hard to prove that QE did much of anything at all.\n<span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">Although the Fed is clearly in tightening mode right now, it will be interesting to hear if Mr. Powell shares any of this skepticism about one of the Fed's major policies over the past decade.</span> <span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">Any commentary from Mr. Powell could provide hints about how the Fed would react during the next downturn.\n</span><span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">Read more here:\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s signature bond buying stimulus program undertaken during and in the wake of the financial crisis was largely a dud for the economy, argues a new paper authored by a group of prominent economists.\n</span>Read Full Article\n<span id=\"58\" class=\"red\">Today will also be our first chance to hear from the Federal Reserve about its unprecedented decision, on Janet Yellen's final day in office, to drop the hammer on Wells Fargo & Co.\nBefore leaving the building, Ms. Yellen signed off on extensive penalties for the \"widespread consumer abuses\" at Wells Fargo that were announced in the evening of her final Friday.</span> <span id=\"59\" class=\"red\">The Fed announced that Wells Fargo would be replacing four members of its board of directors and took action to limit the ability of Wells Fargo to grow.</span> <span id=\"60\" class=\"red\">On the first day of trading after the announcement, Wells Fargo <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 7.8%.</span>\n</span><span id=\"61\" class=\"red\">And just like that, Ms. Yellen was done at the Fed.</span> Congress is likely to have some questions about what went down at this 11th hour (and 59th minute) move against one of America's largest banks.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s unprecedented move to handcuff growth at Wells Fargo sent a strong message to boards of directors and contributed to the bank\u2019s shares falling sharply Monday.\nRead Full Article\n<span id=\"62\"

class=\"red\">ButTuesday\u2019s testimony promises to be very carefully parsed by market participants because of the market swoon and a large increase in federal spending that have occurred since Fed officials met in late January and since Mr. Powell took the helm.</span><span id=\"64\" class=\"red\">\"\nWe'll be closely watching today for any hints of what Mr. Powell thinks about the market's convulsions, the renewed embrace in the U.S. of major deficit spending, and whether inflation is poised to pick up.\n</span><span id=\"65\" class=\"red\">Another theme to watch is whether Mr. Powell signals a pivot in the Fed's approach toward regulation, as this is thought by some to be an area where he might have disagreed with Ms. Yellen's approach.\n</span>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome

Arnold Schwarzenegger, an invitation-only retreat with folding chairs, a fake grass floor and ashtrays. Mr. Schwarzenegger, his aides and California\u2019s most influential players \u2014 mostly white men \u2014 went there to smoke expensive cigars and talk politics and legislative deals.\nBut not Karen Bass.\nNewly elected as the speaker of the State Assembly, Ms. Bass felt apart from that club the moment she stepped through the canvas flaps at the invitation of Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">\u201c\u2018I guess you probably don\u2019t want to be doing business here,\u2019\u201d the governor told her, as Ms. Bass recalled in a recent interview.</span> \u201cHe didn\u2019t know what to do. And that was right. I didn\u2019t want to be in the tent.\u201d\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Here she was, a liberal Democrat and the first Black woman to lead a statehouse in the nation\u2019s history, one of the three most powerful elected leaders of California in a moment of fiscal peril, and a wholly different kind of player navigating among men in a thick haze of cigar smoke.\n</span>\u201cThey didn\u2019t know what to make of me,\u201d she said.\nToday Ms. Bass, a 66-year-old congresswoman and head of the Congressional Black Caucus, is among the leading candidates being considered for vice president by Joseph R. Biden Jr. But in some ways she is still an outsider, making her way in an overwhelmingly male political culture <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">epitomized 12 years</span> ago by Mr. Schwarzenegger, the shoot-\u2019em-up action movie star, and today by the power circles in Washington, where the presidency and vice presidency remain all-male redoubts. She is barely known to many Americans, even to many leading Democrats, who \u2014 like the men in that tent in Sacramento \u2014 are now trying to figure out what to make of her.\nAnd of all the contenders under consideration, none offer quite the contrast with Mr. Biden \u2014 in the story of her life and the story of her politics \u2014 as the Democratic congresswoman from California.\nMs. Bass grew up in a Black middle-class neighborhood in central Los Angeles; Mr. Biden spent his first years in predominantly white, middle-class Scranton, Pa. Mr. Biden was elected to his first public office <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1970,</span> when he <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 27.</span> Ms. Bass <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 51 when</span> she was first elected to the Assembly.\nMs. Bass was liberal in a state known as one of the most liberal in the nation. Mr. Biden is the face of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">One of Ms. Bass\u2019s earliest causes, when she was a community organizer confronting crime, drugs and poverty, was opposing the very criminal justice law that Mr. Biden had championed, with its mandatory jail terms.\n</span>At every step in her political career, Ms. Bass had to be coaxed to run for a higher office. Mr. Biden has been running for president for nearly half a century.\n[Sign up for California Today, our daily newsletter from the Golden State.]\nIn many ways, Ms. Bass could help Mr. Biden against President Trump. She would make history as the first Black woman to become a major party\u2019s candidate for vice president. She talks more about conciliation than confrontation and does not have as many detractors as some of her rivals, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Kamala Harris of California.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Ms. Bass\u2019s advocacy of liberal positions on criminal justice, poverty, housing, foster care and welfare could provide a Biden-Bass ticket a lift with progressive and younger voters.</span> She would arguably be the most liberal politician chosen for vice president since Jimmy Carter tapped Walter F. Mondale as his running mate <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1976.</span>\nBut her record of espousing progressive causes, lack of experience as a national campaigner and still largely unexplored record in public life also offer targets for Mr. Trump.\nIn the 1970s, Ms. Bass joined the Venceremos Brigade, a group of young leftists working on construction projects in Fidel Castro\u2019s Cuba. When Castro died <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016,</span> she put out a statement saying that \u201cthe passing of the Comandante en Jefe is a great loss to the people of Cuba.\u201d Those positions could allow Mr. Trump to continue to attack the Democratic ticket as socialist, and could be damaging with many Cubans in Florida and moderate voters across the Midwest.\nMs. Bass said she had made a mistake calling Castro \u201cComandante en Jefe,\u201d a description widely detested by Cuban exiles. \u201cWouldn\u2019t do that again,\u201d she said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cTalked immediately to my colleagues from Florida and realized that that was something that just shouldn\u2019t have been said.\u201d\nShe said she had gone to Cuba to help the Cuban people by building houses and later to recruit doctors for the United States. \u201cNow, that doesn\u2019t excuse the fact that I know the Castro regime has been a brutal regime to its people,\u201d she said.\nChapters of her career that might have gone unnoticed, even as the leader of the Assembly or a prominent member of Congress, are now coming to the forefront with the scrutiny that comes with being a potential candidate for vice president.\nIn one example, Ms. Bass spoke effusively about the Church of Scientology, the organization scrutinized over cultlike practices and alleged abuse of members, at the opening of its world headquarters in Los Angeles <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010.</span> Over the weekend, she tweeted a statement explaining why she had attended (it was a big project in her district) and added, \u201cJust so you all know, I proudly worship at First New Christian Fellowship Baptist Church in South LA.\u201d\nBack in her days as a street organizer, she had never thought about running for office \u2014 not for the Assembly, not for speaker and not for Congress.\nAnd certainly not for vice president.\n\u201cOh God, no!\u201d she said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything in my background that would make you think that I was planning to run for office, period.\u201d\nAs Mr. Biden closes in on making his choice, Ms. Bass has become a classic inside player, calling party leaders, giving interviews and joining Mr. Biden for a virtual fund-raiser where, in a preview of sorts, she attacked Mr. Trump. Yet she never forgot the lessons she learned in those first days as Assembly speaker.\n\u201cWhen a woman is in a role that\u2019s new, people underestimate,\u201d she said. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou need to know that the minute I got the job, the question was, was I really going to last and be a speaker?</span> Is she real, does she really have any power?\u201d\n\u2018I felt like I had failed a generation\u2019\nAs she grew up in 1960s Los Angeles, Ms. Bass watched the civil rights movement unfold on the nightly news with her father, volunteering to walk precincts for Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated not far from her home.\nAfter graduating from the physician assistant program at the University of Southern California, Ms. Bass worked in an emergency room and taught on the faculty of the college. As she saw more evidence of the crack epidemic that was starting to ravage what was then called South Central Los Angeles, she started a group called the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment, with the help of a federal grant.\nWhile elected officials were beginning to enact harsh legal punishments, Ms. Bass viewed addiction as a public health crisis \u2014 hardly a popular view at the time. In meetings in living rooms and community centers, Ms. Bass argued that there were responses to the epidemic other than the aggressive policing that was widespread in Los Angeles, such as curbing the number of liquor stores in the area. The Community Coalition would become one of the largest and most influential advocacy groups in the city.\n\u201cWhat she saw quickly was that this was not going to be a time-limited campaign to stop government from criminalizing people \u2014 she realized this was going on at a national level and set about to build an organization that was really going to be focused on local reality,\u201d said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, who took over the organization from Ms. Bass and is now a councilman from the area.\nWhat made her work notable, Mr. Harris-Dawson said, was her emphasis on bringing attention to local residents. When television cameras showed up, she would often step aside and defer to the people who lived there, her attitude shaped in part by seeing the civil rights movement lose momentum after the assassinations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy.\nFor young organizers on staff, she offered specific lessons: Talk to everyone you can meet in the community, don\u2019t rely on rhetoric and theories learned in college or activist circles, always have the conversation with someone who has expressed disagreement with you. She instructed them to shop in local grocery stores and strike up conversations with residents while waiting in line.\nAt the time, South Los Angeles was starting to shift from being a largely African-American neighborhood to one where Latinos eventually became the majority. The neighborhood would soon go through turmoil after a video captured members of the Los Angeles Police Department beating Rodney King after a high-speed police chase <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1991.</span>\nMs. Bass said she initially thought the widely seen recording of the beating would drive sweeping change \u2014 \u201cfinally, there was evidence of what we had been talking about for years,\u201d she said. She, like many others in the city, was stunned when the officers were acquitted <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1992 and</span> disheartened when the verdict was met with violence and riots, many in her neighborhood.\n\u201cI felt like I had failed a generation, that they were so angry and that we hadn\u2019t gotten change,\u201d she said.\nIn the weeks after the uprising, Ms. Bass went block by block surveying the damage, which had ravaged large areas of the city. As officials set about plans for rebuilding, she focused on keeping out the kinds of businesses that residents had long complained were too prevalent, such as liquor stores and motels, and which she said contributed to the proliferation of drugs in the community.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">By 1994,</span> there was clear evidence of how much the Community Coalition was going against the grain with its theories for dealing with crime. And it came from Washington: a crime bill that would set mandatory minimum sentences for possession of crack cocaine.\nOne of the main champions of the bill was Mr. Biden.\n\u201cThe crime bill was aimed at the war on drugs, and that went against the very reason she started Community Coalition,\u201d said Mark Ridley-Thomas, a Los Angeles County supervisor and longtime friend of Ms. Bass\u2019s. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cShe knew that the declaration of a war on drugs was to declare war on human beings who were suffering from a range of addictions, and that was the wrong approach.\u201d\nMs. Bass initially thought that she could be more effective dealing with the ills of her city \u2014 drugs, crime, poverty \u2014 in private organizations free of the strains of electoral politics.\n</span>But during those years in Los Angeles, Ms. Bass achieved a level of prominence and prestige in the community and with local officials, who began to consult her on issues like appointments to the Police Department and education policy.\nThen, <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2004,</span> pressed by elected officials whom she had been working with, she agreed to run for the State Assembly. The outside player was ready to move to the inside.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Crafting a way out of fiscal crisis\nCalifornia was sliding into crisis \u2014 <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $41 billion</span> deficit, larger than the entire budget of many states \u2014 when Ms. Bass was elected speaker in <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2008.</span></span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">For the next two years, she and other legislative leaders struggled with Mr. Schwarzenegger over a punishing package of spending cuts and tax increases to rescue California from its worst fiscal crisis since the Depression.\n</span>It also was a time of a tragedy in her life: <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2006,</span> her only daughter and her son-in-law were killed in a car crash, an echo of the loss Mr. Biden has experienced; his wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1972.</span>\n\u201cI had a choice as to whether to go back to work or hide,\u201d Ms. Bass said. \u201cI had to embrace the grief and wrap myself in grief. People don\u2019t know how to deal with death and people avoid you, people don\u2019t know what to say. Parents who have lost their children, you join a club that you didn\u2019t ask to be a part of.\u201d\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The collapse of the national economy and housing market had hammered the state\u2019s finances.</span> Workers were forced to take furloughs. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Vendors were paid with i.o.u.s, and tax refunds were delayed.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt was the worst budget time in the history of California by far,\u201d said Michael C.

Arnold Schwarzenegger, an invitation-only retreat with folding chairs, a fake grass floor and ashtrays. Mr. Schwarzenegger, his aides and California\u2019s most influential players \u2014 mostly white men \u2014 went there to smoke expensive cigars and talk politics and legislative deals.\nBut not Karen Bass.\nNewly elected as the speaker of the State Assembly, Ms. Bass felt apart from that club the moment she stepped through the canvas flaps at the invitation of Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">\u201c\u2018I guess you probably don\u2019t want to be doing business here,\u2019\u201d the governor told her, as Ms. Bass recalled in a recent interview.</span> \u201cHe didn\u2019t know what to do. And that was right. I didn\u2019t want to be in the tent.\u201d\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Here she was, a liberal Democrat and the first Black woman to lead a statehouse in the nation\u2019s history, one of the three most powerful elected leaders of California in a moment of fiscal peril, and a wholly different kind of player navigating among men in a thick haze of cigar smoke.\n</span>\u201cThey didn\u2019t know what to make of me,\u201d she said.\nToday Ms. Bass, a 66-year-old congresswoman and head of the Congressional Black Caucus, is among the leading candidates being considered for vice president by Joseph R. Biden Jr. But in some ways she is still an outsider, making her way in an overwhelmingly male political culture <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">epitomized 12 years</span> ago by Mr. Schwarzenegger, the shoot-\u2019em-up action movie star, and today by the power circles in Washington, where the presidency and vice presidency remain all-male redoubts. She is barely known to many Americans, even to many leading Democrats, who \u2014 like the men in that tent in Sacramento \u2014 are now trying to figure out what to make of her.\nAnd of all the contenders under consideration, none offer quite the contrast with Mr. Biden \u2014 in the story of her life and the story of her politics \u2014 as the Democratic congresswoman from California.\nMs. Bass grew up in a Black middle-class neighborhood in central Los Angeles; Mr. Biden spent his first years in predominantly white, middle-class Scranton, Pa. Mr. Biden was elected to his first public office <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1970,</span> when he <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 27.</span> Ms. Bass <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 51 when</span> she was first elected to the Assembly.\nMs. Bass was liberal in a state known as one of the most liberal in the nation. Mr. Biden is the face of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">One of Ms. Bass\u2019s earliest causes, when she was a community organizer confronting crime, drugs and poverty, was opposing the very criminal justice law that Mr. Biden had championed, with its mandatory jail terms.\n</span>At every step in her political career, Ms. Bass had to be coaxed to run for a higher office. Mr. Biden has been running for president for nearly half a century.\n[Sign up for California Today, our daily newsletter from the Golden State.]\nIn many ways, Ms. Bass could help Mr. Biden against President Trump. She would make history as the first Black woman to become a major party\u2019s candidate for vice president. She talks more about conciliation than confrontation and does not have as many detractors as some of her rivals, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Kamala Harris of California.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Ms. Bass\u2019s advocacy of liberal positions on criminal justice, poverty, housing, foster care and welfare could provide a Biden-Bass ticket a lift with progressive and younger voters.</span> She would arguably be the most liberal politician chosen for vice president since Jimmy Carter tapped Walter F. Mondale as his running mate <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1976.</span>\nBut her record of espousing progressive causes, lack of experience as a national campaigner and still largely unexplored record in public life also offer targets for Mr. Trump.\nIn the 1970s, Ms. Bass joined the Venceremos Brigade, a group of young leftists working on construction projects in Fidel Castro\u2019s Cuba. When Castro died <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016,</span> she put out a statement saying that \u201cthe passing of the Comandante en Jefe is a great loss to the people of Cuba.\u201d Those positions could allow Mr. Trump to continue to attack the Democratic ticket as socialist, and could be damaging with many Cubans in Florida and moderate voters across the Midwest.\nMs. Bass said she had made a mistake calling Castro \u201cComandante en Jefe,\u201d a description widely detested by Cuban exiles. \u201cWouldn\u2019t do that again,\u201d she said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cTalked immediately to my colleagues from Florida and realized that that was something that just shouldn\u2019t have been said.\u201d\nShe said she had gone to Cuba to help the Cuban people by building houses and later to recruit doctors for the United States. \u201cNow, that doesn\u2019t excuse the fact that I know the Castro regime has been a brutal regime to its people,\u201d she said.\nChapters of her career that might have gone unnoticed, even as the leader of the Assembly or a prominent member of Congress, are now coming to the forefront with the scrutiny that comes with being a potential candidate for vice president.\nIn one example, Ms. Bass spoke effusively about the Church of Scientology, the organization scrutinized over cultlike practices and alleged abuse of members, at the opening of its world headquarters in Los Angeles <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010.</span> Over the weekend, she tweeted a statement explaining why she had attended (it was a big project in her district) and added, \u201cJust so you all know, I proudly worship at First New Christian Fellowship Baptist Church in South LA.\u201d\nBack in her days as a street organizer, she had never thought about running for office \u2014 not for the Assembly, not for speaker and not for Congress.\nAnd certainly not for vice president.\n\u201cOh God, no!\u201d she said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything in my background that would make you think that I was planning to run for office, period.\u201d\nAs Mr. Biden closes in on making his choice, Ms. Bass has become a classic inside player, calling party leaders, giving interviews and joining Mr. Biden for a virtual fund-raiser where, in a preview of sorts, she attacked Mr. Trump. Yet she never forgot the lessons she learned in those first days as Assembly speaker.\n\u201cWhen a woman is in a role that\u2019s new, people underestimate,\u201d she said. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou need to know that the minute I got the job, the question was, was I really going to last and be a speaker?</span> Is she real, does she really have any power?\u201d\n\u2018I felt like I had failed a generation\u2019\nAs she grew up in 1960s Los Angeles, Ms. Bass watched the civil rights movement unfold on the nightly news with her father, volunteering to walk precincts for Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated not far from her home.\nAfter graduating from the physician assistant program at the University of Southern California, Ms. Bass worked in an emergency room and taught on the faculty of the college. As she saw more evidence of the crack epidemic that was starting to ravage what was then called South Central Los Angeles, she started a group called the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment, with the help of a federal grant.\nWhile elected officials were beginning to enact harsh legal punishments, Ms. Bass viewed addiction as a public health crisis \u2014 hardly a popular view at the time. In meetings in living rooms and community centers, Ms. Bass argued that there were responses to the epidemic other than the aggressive policing that was widespread in Los Angeles, such as curbing the number of liquor stores in the area. The Community Coalition would become one of the largest and most influential advocacy groups in the city.\n\u201cWhat she saw quickly was that this was not going to be a time-limited campaign to stop government from criminalizing people \u2014 she realized this was going on at a national level and set about to build an organization that was really going to be focused on local reality,\u201d said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, who took over the organization from Ms. Bass and is now a councilman from the area.\nWhat made her work notable, Mr. Harris-Dawson said, was her emphasis on bringing attention to local residents. When television cameras showed up, she would often step aside and defer to the people who lived there, her attitude shaped in part by seeing the civil rights movement lose momentum after the assassinations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy.\nFor young organizers on staff, she offered specific lessons: Talk to everyone you can meet in the community, don\u2019t rely on rhetoric and theories learned in college or activist circles, always have the conversation with someone who has expressed disagreement with you. She instructed them to shop in local grocery stores and strike up conversations with residents while waiting in line.\nAt the time, South Los Angeles was starting to shift from being a largely African-American neighborhood to one where Latinos eventually became the majority. The neighborhood would soon go through turmoil after a video captured members of the Los Angeles Police Department beating Rodney King after a high-speed police chase <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1991.</span>\nMs. Bass said she initially thought the widely seen recording of the beating would drive sweeping change \u2014 \u201cfinally, there was evidence of what we had been talking about for years,\u201d she said. She, like many others in the city, was stunned when the officers were acquitted <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1992 and</span> disheartened when the verdict was met with violence and riots, many in her neighborhood.\n\u201cI felt like I had failed a generation, that they were so angry and that we hadn\u2019t gotten change,\u201d she said.\nIn the weeks after the uprising, Ms. Bass went block by block surveying the damage, which had ravaged large areas of the city. As officials set about plans for rebuilding, she focused on keeping out the kinds of businesses that residents had long complained were too prevalent, such as liquor stores and motels, and which she said contributed to the proliferation of drugs in the community.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">By 1994,</span> there was clear evidence of how much the Community Coalition was going against the grain with its theories for dealing with crime. And it came from Washington: a crime bill that would set mandatory minimum sentences for possession of crack cocaine.\nOne of the main champions of the bill was Mr. Biden.\n\u201cThe crime bill was aimed at the war on drugs, and that went against the very reason she started Community Coalition,\u201d said Mark Ridley-Thomas, a Los Angeles County supervisor and longtime friend of Ms. Bass\u2019s. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cShe knew that the declaration of a war on drugs was to declare war on human beings who were suffering from a range of addictions, and that was the wrong approach.\u201d\nMs. Bass initially thought that she could be more effective dealing with the ills of her city \u2014 drugs, crime, poverty \u2014 in private organizations free of the strains of electoral politics.\n</span>But during those years in Los Angeles, Ms. Bass achieved a level of prominence and prestige in the community and with local officials, who began to consult her on issues like appointments to the Police Department and education policy.\nThen, <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2004,</span> pressed by elected officials whom she had been working with, she agreed to run for the State Assembly. The outside player was ready to move to the inside.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Crafting a way out of fiscal crisis\nCalifornia was sliding into crisis \u2014 <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $41 billion</span> deficit, larger than the entire budget of many states \u2014 when Ms. Bass was elected speaker in <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2008.</span></span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">For the next two years, she and other legislative leaders struggled with Mr. Schwarzenegger over a punishing package of spending cuts and tax increases to rescue California from its worst fiscal crisis since the Depression.\n</span>It also was a time of a tragedy in her life: <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2006,</span> her only daughter and her son-in-law were killed in a car crash, an echo of the loss Mr. Biden has experienced; his wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1972.</span>\n\u201cI had a choice as to whether to go back to work or hide,\u201d Ms. Bass said. \u201cI had to embrace the grief and wrap myself in grief. People don\u2019t know how to deal with death and people avoid you, people don\u2019t know what to say. Parents who have lost their children, you join a club that you didn\u2019t ask to be a part of.\u201d\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">The collapse of the national economy and housing market had hammered the state\u2019s finances.</span> Workers were forced to take furloughs. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Vendors were paid with i.o.u.s, and tax refunds were delayed.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt was the worst budget time in the history of California by far,\u201d said Michael C. Genest, who was Mr. Schwarzenegger\u2019s top financial adviser.</span> \u201cThe major dynamic was that Republicans wanted to cut, Democrats wanted to raise taxes. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">And the reality was we could never cut enough to balance the budget.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">And we could never raise taxes enough to balance the budget.\u201d\n</span>Democrats held a substantial majority in the Assembly and the Senate. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">But passing a budget in California at the time required a vote by two-thirds of members of each chamber.</span> As a result, Republican leaders had significant power in the negotiations.\nJohn A.

Though not as expansive as Mr. Moon's, they represent a significant shift to the middle from when she ran for president five years ago and narrowly lost the conservative party nomination to Mr. Lee.\n\nOn security matters, Ms. Park favors diplomatic engagement and what she calls \"trust building\" with North Korea. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Mr. Moon wants to go further by returning to the few-questions-asked economic assistance South Korea provided to the North under the most recent liberal president, Roh Moo-hyun.</span> Mr. Moon was Mr. Roh's presidential chief of staff.\n\nNorth Korea injected itself into the election last week by firing a long-range missile. Both Ms. Park and Mr. Moon criticized Pyongyang, and, with South Koreans accustomed to the North's provocations, it hasn't turned into a major issue.\n\nWhile the division between North Korea and South Korea is most visible to the world, another division exists inside the South that is nearly as sharp. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">It is between the country's southeastern provinces, which were home to most of its industry and benefited most from the economic choices of Ms. Park's father in the 1960s and 1970s, and its southwestern ones, which spawned the democracy movement that rebelled against him.\n\n</span>Mr. Moon,<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 59 years</span> old, is from the country's southeastern province, the conservative power base.

As security agents took down the would-be assassin, a stray bullet struck Ms. Park's mother, who died a few hours later. <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Then 22,</span> Ms. Park took on the role of first lady, presiding over ceremonies and hosting state events until her father was shot and killed by his security chief <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1979.</span>\n\nShe withdrew from the spotlight through the 1980s, the period when South Korea formed a middle class and democracy activism spread beyond the university campuses and leftist groups. <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1987,</span> a new constitution formed the country's modern political system, with presidents elected to single, five-year terms.\n\nAs <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1987 constitution</span> took effect, many people who had fled or were exiled in the 1970s returned to South Korea. Among them was Kim Kyung-jae, who had his passport revoked while on a trip to the U.S. <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1972,</span> then wrote books critical of Ms. Park's father.\n\nHe returned to South Jeolla province in the southwest and became an aide to a prominent anti-Park antagonist elected as president <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1997.</span></span> Mr. Kim later won election himself to parliament.\n\nThere, he was assigned to a committee with Ms. Park. But while they often sat near each other, Mr. Kim says he never spoke to her because he wasn't sure how to break the ice. \"I had written a five-volume book criticizing her father,\" he said.\n\nTwo years ago, with her eyes set on <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2012 race</span>, Ms. Park asked aides to reach out to associates of her father's antagonist, the former liberal President Kim Dae-jung, who died <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2009.</span> She wanted to discuss issues and their potential support, officials with her campaign said, knowing that some of the former associates had been alienated by younger leaders from the liberal party and might help her pick up some votes in the southwestern provinces.\n\nIn a written answer to questions submitted to her campaign, Ms. Park said she wants to end South Korea's regional division. \"I also believe that national unity cannot be achieved solely through reconciling with the past,\" she wrote. Ms. Park also said she would seek \"more balanced development between regions.\"\n\nShe isn't the first president trying to bridge the gap. <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1999,</span> the second year of his presidency, Kim Dae-jung visited the birthplace of Ms. Park's father and announced a plan to build a memorial park to the man he had fought for years, saying Mr. Park had instilled South Koreans with a \"can-do spirit.\"\n\n<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2004,</span> about a year after the president had left office, Ms. Park visited his home in Seoul and apologized for the suffering he experienced at her father's hand and thanked him for the park. \"I tried hard but still failed to accomplish regional harmony,\" the former president told her, according to Korean media reports at the time. \"I think you are the right person to seek it.\"\n\nIn the statement provided by the campaign, Ms. Park said she remembered the former president's admonition. \"I wholeheartedly agreed with President Kim's aspirations,\" she said.\n\nThis August, the day after winning her party's nomination, Ms. Park visited the graves of all of South Korea's former presidents, in what she called an effort at national unity. But in early September, she appeared to agree with a controversial verdict against dissidents by her father's government. Some people felt she was criticizing those who stood up to her father.\n\nMs. Park called Kim Kyung-jae, her former committee mate, for help, Mr. Kim said. He said he told her that he remained critical of her father and that she needed to clear the air about the other activists.\n\nOn Sept.<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24,</span> Ms. Park gave a 10-minute, televised speech in which she criticized her father in the strongest terms she had ever expressed publicly. But she added that he was still her father.\n\n\"Respected people, I don't believe that you really want me to spit on my father's grave,\" she said in the speech. \"Looking back, so many people tried hard for industrialization and democratization. Now, I think we need to put our efforts together, with respect, for even bigger national development.\"\n\nShortly after the speech, Mr. Kim said Ms. Park called him. He said that he told her, \"It was much stronger than I imagined. Now I will help you.\" A campaign spokesman said Mr. Kim joined the campaign after the speech, but he said he couldn't verify details of Ms. Park's conversations.\n\nMr. Kim joined Han Gwang-ok, who had been presidential chief of staff to Kim Dae-jung, at the head of the national unity committee inside Ms. Park's campaign.\n\nMr. Han, who was imprisoned twice by her father's regime, had similarly been recruited for months by Ms. Park's aides. He said he remembered Kim Dae-jung's goodwill to Ms. Park after <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">her 2004 meeting</span> with the former president.\n\n\"In life, there are things to quickly leave off and things to hang on to,\" Mr. Han said. \"The things to throw away are the unpleasant things from the past. The things to keep are patriotism and how to live the rest of life with dignity.\"\n\nKim Hyun-jang, an activist in the South Jeolla city of Gwangju who was imprisoned for <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1982 arson</span> at a U.S. cultural center that was one of the most violent acts of the democracy movement, also joined Ms. Park's campaign. Unlike the former politicians, he said he had no difficult rationalizing his support for Ms. Park with his disdain for her father. \"In that time, there was no freedom at all,\" he said. \"Everything is different.\"\n\nThe three men and others have been meeting friends and associates in the Jeolla provinces to court voters. But they often have been received coolly. A columnist at a Gwangju newspaper called them \"political migratory birds.\"\n\nOthers are willing to give her a chance. Ms. Park recently spoke at at Chonbuk National University in North Jeolla. \"There are still regional objections to her,\" said Kim Du-yong, a student who watched her. \"She can overcome them if she brings investment here.\"\n\nKim Kyung-jae, who stood with Ms. Park on the stage in Jeonju, said afterward that some of his friends and former constituents in the area call him a \"betrayer\" for helping her. \"I admit some of their criticisms, but still I think I have some influence on Jeolla voters,\" he said.\n\nMin Sun Lee contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Evan Ramstad at evan.ramstad@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8", "displayed_text": "<h3>U.S. Ally South Korea Nears Pivotal Election</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Presidential Vote Comes as Economic and Territorial Tensions Rise; Candidate Reaches Out to Her Father's Foes for Help\n\nUpdated Dec.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 17,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012 8</span>:01 pm ET\n\nJEONJU, South Korea\u2014Park Geun-hye is vying to become South Korea's first woman president.</span> To do so, she is reaching out to some of the people who were arrested, jailed and even exiled when her father was president in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Wednesday's election comes at a pivotal time for both Asia and for South Korea, a key U.S. ally and a growing economic force in the world.</span> Korean brands like Samsung, LG and Hyundai have become household names around the world. South Korea borders the country that poses the greatest security risk in Asia, nuclear-armed North Korea. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">And economic and territorial tensions are rising between its two largest trading partners and bigger neighbors, China and Japan.\n\n</span>National polls until recently showed the conservative Ms. Park as the front-runner for the presidential election. The latest polls, taken in the middle of last week, indicated a tossup between her and her liberal opponent, Moon Jae-in.\n\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">South Korea's next president will face many of the problems that Japan\u2014whose economic model it has most closely emulated\u2014did two decades ago: slowing growth rates, rising competitive pressure from lower-income countries, and an aging society.</span> By the end of the next president's term <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018,</span> South Korea's working-age population will have started to shrink.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Both Ms. Park and Mr. Moon promise a more centrist approach to the economy than current President Lee Myung-bak, a conservative who lowered corporate taxes and pursued a weak currency to help the nation's exporters.</span> The candidates support big increases in health care and other welfare programs and will likely raise taxes to pay for it.\n\nMs. Park's welfare pledges include free treatment for cancer, heart disease and other serious illnesses. Though not as expansive as Mr. Moon's, they represent a significant shift to the middle from when she ran for president five years ago and narrowly lost the conservative party nomination to Mr. Lee.\n\nOn security matters, Ms. Park favors diplomatic engagement and what she calls \"trust building\" with North Korea. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Mr. Moon wants to go further by returning to the few-questions-asked economic assistance South Korea provided to the North under the most recent liberal president, Roh Moo-hyun.</span> Mr. Moon was Mr. Roh's presidential chief of staff.\n\nNorth Korea injected itself into the election last week by firing a long-range missile. Both Ms. Park and Mr. Moon criticized Pyongyang, and, with South Koreans accustomed to the North's provocations, it hasn't turned into a major issue.\n\nWhile the division between North Korea and South Korea is most visible to the world, another division exists inside the South that is nearly as sharp. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">It is between the country's southeastern provinces, which were home to most of its industry and benefited most from the economic choices of Ms. Park's father in the 1960s and 1970s, and its southwestern ones, which spawned the democracy movement that rebelled against him.\n\n</span>Mr. Moon,<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 59 years</span> old, is from the country's southeastern province, the conservative power base. His election to parliament in April was the first time a liberal had been elected from his district in Busan, the country's second-largest city. His campaign is trying to <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reach 40% support</span> in the province for the presidential race, a spokeswoman said, exceeding what a liberal candidate has done before.\n\nMs. Park,<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 60,</span> entered politics <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1997.</span></span> She repeatedly won election to the national parliament from a city in the conservative southeast.\n\nIn one of the biggest gambles of her presidential campaign, she is making a play for the liberal southwestern provinces.

Many homeowners would be insulted by what Redfin could rationally offer. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">His statement is strange because the housing market is in a very strange place \u2014 and finding a new normal will require some ugly adjustments, psychological as well as financial.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">As I noted in June, most American homeowners have known only a world of steadily falling interest rates.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Mortgage rates hit their all-time high in the early 1980s, as the Fed under Paul Volcker aggressively tightened monetary policy to fight record inflation.</span> Since then, rates have followed a long downward trend. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Prices responded with a corresponding upward trend \u2014 albeit with some brutal interruptions, most notably, the collapse of the housing bubble <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 2006.</span>\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">During the financial crisis, however, the Fed stepped in with more easy money, and <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2022 most</span> homeowners were sitting on a nice chunk of equity.</span> This made homeowners feel prosperous and secure. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">It probably also boosted consumer demand, because people who feel richer are willing to spend more.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">And despite the memories of the crash, most people still take it for granted that housing is a great investment as well as a way to keep the rain off their heads.\n</span>These trends could not go on forever. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">During the pandemic, my credit union was offering 15-year fixed-rate mortgages for less <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 2 percent</span> annual interest, and they weren\u2019t going to keep lowering that rate until they were paying me money to buy a house.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Now, we are in the midst of a sharp reversal and prices will have to adjust accordingly.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Someone who could have gotten a mortgage <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 3 to</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4 percent</span> a few years ago now has to pay more than twice that.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">To keep their mortgage payment the same, the cost of the house would have to fall by almost half.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Now, not everyone has to worry so much about their monthly payment; older home buyers who have built up some equity aren\u2019t as sensitive to mortgage rates.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">But unless prices drop significantly, the market will be starved of new entrants \u2014 which means falling demand and, ultimately, lower prices.\n</span>Home buyers aren\u2019t yet ready to recognize the extent of that loss, so they won\u2019t sell their homes unless they really, really have to. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Especially because moving would mean giving up the absurdly low mortgage rates that prevailed before the Fed got serious about fighting inflation.\n</span>Many of the real estate listings in my neighborhood now have an eerie quality, like looking at the twinkling light of some long-dead star. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Houses sit on the market or prices drift downward in tiny increments that are wholly inadequate to the magnitude of the interest-rate shift.</span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Though supply remains quite low by historical standards, inventories are rising, and sales have fallen by almost a quarter.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Homeowners seem to be sitting out the market, waiting for the return of the good times.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">This helps explain why median sales prices have fallen by only <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 7 percent</span>, from a June high <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $413,800 to</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $384,800 in</span> September \u2014 and were still up year-over-year.\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Of course, <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 7 percent</span> decline might be a good deal if interest rates fall back to where they were fairly quickly.</span> Home buyers could suffer a high payment for a couple of years, and then refinance into something more affordable \u2014 and sellers could avoid taking a hit to their personal wealth. <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s one way we could get out of this strange market.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">But it\u2019s hard to imagine that interest rates are going back to where they were during the pandemic.</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">The public health crisis is over, and the Fed is now in inflation-fighting mode.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">We homeowners might never again be as rich as we felt <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020 and</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021 </span>\u2014 which would mean that the only way the market can go back to normal is for us to eventually, painfully admit that we\u2019re poorer, and move on.</span>", "displayed_text": "<h3>Opinion | Homeowners aren\u2019t ready to face how much less their houses are worth</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Over the years, I have encountered a lot of weird statements from company chief executives announcing layoffs or business setbacks.</span> <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">But possibly the strangest one came on Wednesday from Redfin chief executive Glenn Kelman, who said his firm was letting go <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 13 percent</span> of its workforce, and shuttering its \u201ciBuying\u201d division, which bought homes directly from consumers, did light renovations and put them back on the market.\n</span>Anyone who has watched a house-flipping show knows how hard it can be to make money that way.

Many homeowners would be insulted by what Redfin could rationally offer. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">His statement is strange because the housing market is in a very strange place \u2014 and finding a new normal will require some ugly adjustments, psychological as well as financial.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">As I noted in June, most American homeowners have known only a world of steadily falling interest rates.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Mortgage rates hit their all-time high in the early 1980s, as the Fed under Paul Volcker aggressively tightened monetary policy to fight record inflation.</span> Since then, rates have followed a long downward trend. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Prices responded with a corresponding upward trend \u2014 albeit with some brutal interruptions, most notably, the collapse of the housing bubble <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 2006.</span>\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">During the financial crisis, however, the Fed stepped in with more easy money, and <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2022 most</span> homeowners were sitting on a nice chunk of equity.</span> This made homeowners feel prosperous and secure. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">It probably also boosted consumer demand, because people who feel richer are willing to spend more.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">And despite the memories of the crash, most people still take it for granted that housing is a great investment as well as a way to keep the rain off their heads.\n</span>These trends could not go on forever. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">During the pandemic, my credit union was offering 15-year fixed-rate mortgages for less <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 2 percent</span> annual interest, and they weren\u2019t going to keep lowering that rate until they were paying me money to buy a house.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Now, we are in the midst of a sharp reversal and prices will have to adjust accordingly.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Someone who could have gotten a mortgage <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 3 to</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4 percent</span> a few years ago now has to pay more than twice that.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">To keep their mortgage payment the same, the cost of the house would have to fall by almost half.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Now, not everyone has to worry so much about their monthly payment; older home buyers who have built up some equity aren\u2019t as sensitive to mortgage rates.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">But unless prices drop significantly, the market will be starved of new entrants \u2014 which means falling demand and, ultimately, lower prices.\n</span>Home buyers aren\u2019t yet ready to recognize the extent of that loss, so they won\u2019t sell their homes unless they really, really have to. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Especially because moving would mean giving up the absurdly low mortgage rates that prevailed before the Fed got serious about fighting inflation.\n</span>Many of the real estate listings in my neighborhood now have an eerie quality, like looking at the twinkling light of some long-dead star. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Houses sit on the market or prices drift downward in tiny increments that are wholly inadequate to the magnitude of the interest-rate shift.</span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Though supply remains quite low by historical standards, inventories are rising, and sales have fallen by almost a quarter.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Homeowners seem to be sitting out the market, waiting for the return of the good times.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">This helps explain why median sales prices have fallen by only <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 7 percent</span>, from a June high <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $413,800 to</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $384,800 in</span> September \u2014 and were still up year-over-year.\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Of course, <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 7 percent</span> decline might be a good deal if interest rates fall back to where they were fairly quickly.</span> Home buyers could suffer a high payment for a couple of years, and then refinance into something more affordable \u2014 and sellers could avoid taking a hit to their personal wealth. <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s one way we could get out of this strange market.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">But it\u2019s hard to imagine that interest rates are going back to where they were during the pandemic.</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">The public health crisis is over, and the Fed is now in inflation-fighting mode.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">We homeowners might never again be as rich as we felt <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020 and</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2021 </span>\u2014 which would mean that the only way the market can go back to normal is for us to eventually, painfully admit that we\u2019re poorer, and move on.</span>"}, "13915": {"id": "13915", "text": "<h3>U.S. markets wrap up worst week since the 2008 financial crisis</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">U.S. markets wrapped up one of their messiest-ever weeks Friday, recording their worst finish since <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2008 financial</span> crisis.</span> <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Standard & Poor\u2019<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 500 tumbled</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 15 percent</span> from where it began Monday, with stocks wrenched all week in hourly spasms as investors tried to fathom where the coronavirus will eventually leave the U.S. economy.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The craziness ran right up to the closing bell, with the S&P and the Dow Jones industrial average plunging more <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 3 percent</span> minutes after the World Health Organization warned that global health systems were \u201ccollapsing\u201d under the strain of the pandemic.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Wall Street\u2019s meltdown over the past month has erased all of the stock market gains since President Trump entered the White House.</span> On Feb.<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12,</span> the Dow peaked <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 29,551.42 </span>\u2014 <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 49 percent</span> jump from its close on Trump\u2019s Inauguration Day in <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">January 2017.</span> But within a span of weeks it has lost a third of its value as the coronavirus crisis has played out.

The Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S.

Marriott, which said it had been operating in Russia <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 25 years</span></span>, joins a long list of multinational companies pulling out of the country amid sanctions.\nMr. Stoltenberg, NATO\u2019s secretary general, said he had met with Prime Minister Sanna Marin of Finland in Washington on Friday, and discussed the country\u2019s application to the military alliance. He said he had also had a \u201cconstructive phone call\u201d with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey about Mr. Erdogan\u2019s concerns about Sweden and Finland joining NATO.\nUkrainian troops have managed to push back Russian forces <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 20 percent</span></span> in Russia\u2019s fight for the city of Sievierodonetsk, the last major pocket of Ukrainian control in the eastern province of Luhansk, the regional military administrator said in a television interview. He had previously said that most of the industrial city had been taken over by the Russians.\nSIVERSK DISTRICT, Ukraine \u2014 One of the few civilians still driving on a road leading toward the battle front, Oleksandr Chaplik skidded to a stop and leaned out the car window to swap information with a villager.\nHe was taking supplies back to his village, one of a handful still in Ukrainian hands that lie in the path of the Russian advance.\n\u201cWe are surrounded on all sides,\u201d said Mr. Chaplik,<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 55,</span> a dairy and livestock farmer. \u201cIt is the second month without light, without water, without gas, without communication, without the internet, without news. Basically, horror.\u201d\n\u201cBut people need to eat,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a businessman. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">So I am doing my job.\u201d\nMr. Chaplik owns <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 75 acres</span> of land near the city of Sievierodonetsk, where Russian and Ukrainian troops have been battling for control in heavy street fighting in recent days.</span> The countryside around his farm is under almost constant bombardment by Russian forces trying to encircle the easternmost Ukrainian forces and lay siege to Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk.\nThe roar of multiple rocket launcher systems being fired south of the farm rattled the windows and doors of his home. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, those are Ukrainian,\u201d he said as he gave a tour of his farm. \u201cHere, thank God, the guys are holding firm.\u201d\nBELARUS\nRUSSIA\nKyiv\nLviv\nUKRAINE\nSievierodonetsk\nLysychansk\nDnipro\nMOLDOVA\nROMANIA\nSea of\nAzov\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">CRIMEA\n100 mileS</span>\nBut the war has come dangerously close. Craters from bombs and artillery shells scar his fields. Leaning against the wall of one of his barns stood the casings of a dozen rockets that Mr. Chaplik had collected from around the farm. The rockets delivered cluster bombs, he said, which still littered his hayfields.\n\u201cThey want to be eating grass,\u201d he said as he walked down the stalls of <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 35 dairy</span> cows. \u201cBut I cannot let the cows loose on this grass because of these bombs, and I am scared they will fall in the bomb craters.\u201d\nMr. Chaplik is a fraying connection to the world for his increasingly isolated village, which he asked not be named so it would not suffer retribution from Russian troops. At considerable risk to himself, he provides vital supplies and information, and keeps producing food as best he can.\nMany other farmers have left the area but he said he could not. \u201cI can\u2019t leave the people,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I leave, I will not be able to return to the village, I will not be able to look people in the eye.\u201d\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">But as the war has crept closer, he has had to shrink his business while trying to keep the farm producing and workers fed and paid.</span> With utilities cut off, he runs the milk machines on generators, but can only operate his refrigerators <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 12 hours</span> a day.\n\u201cWe used to make <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 100 different</span> milk products,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a two-years-old Parmesan cheese. I made unique products that no one else was making, sour cream, cream, mozzarella, burrata.\u201d\nBut without electricity he has had to cut down on production. There was a shortage of containers, he added. He removed two cheeses with moldy rinds from a fridge. \u201cThey are no good,\u201d he said.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">He has moved his food production operations to several different parts of the country, placing part of his dairy production in the nearby market town of Bakhmut, where he already has an organic meat and dairy shop, and relocating his meat production plants to the relatively safe cities of Dnipro and Lviv.\n</span>His family has moved, too. His wife is a teacher and two of his children are university students, so they needed to go somewhere with the internet to be able to keep working, he said. They were calling him daily, pleading with him to join them, but he said he still had work to do.\nHis work force has contracted, as many villagers left with their families for safer parts of the country. \u201cI have fields and machines and diesel but I do not have the workers,\u201d he said. But he pulled together <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 10 workers</span> who remained, so they now live and eat together.\nTwo teenage girls were mucking out the cow stalls. \u201cThey are the daughters of my workers. They are children, but I have no workers,\u201d he said.\nA pensioner, Lyudmila,<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 68,</span> has stepped in to run his shop in the village.\n\u201cDid you get cucumbers?\u201d she called out, as Mr. Chaplik unloaded bottled water and fresh vegetables from his van.\n\u201cWithout him we would be lost,\u201d she said. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Villagers could not travel to the market, and prices there were much higher anyway, she said.\n</span>But the strain shows on Mr. Chaplik\u2019s face. He looks like he has not slept in days. He complained of toothache and a twitch around his eye. One of the hardest things, he said, was fielding the panicked telephone calls from relatives trying to reach the villagers who have remained behind. The cellphone service in the village has been knocked out <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">but they know that Mr. Chaplik drives into town every day to the market, where cell service continues, and they bombard him with calls.\n</span>\u201cMy nerves are cracking,\u201d he said, as he declined another phone call. \u201cI am <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">working 14 to</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 15 hours</span> a day. Physically I am tired.\u201d\nSo now he is arranging for his son to bring in a mobile antenna, so the villagers can be in touch with their relatives.\nHe sees more problems on the horizon. The war has disrupted farming and food production to such an extent that people in eastern Ukraine could go hungry in coming months, he warned.\nThe potatoes are already planted, which will provide food for the villagers, he said, but meat and milk will become scarce.\n\u201cIf I do not prepare feed for my cows they will die this winter,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot cut the hay because of the cluster bombs in the fields and I <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">need 12,000 bales</span> of hay and I do not have the workers.\u201d\nAnd as he follows the progress of the war, and the steady advance of Russian troops, he said it was likely that they would seize control of the village and he would lose the farm that he built up over more <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 20 years</span>.\nSeparatist forces backed by Russia seized the area <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014 but</span> were pushed back after a few months. But this time he said he did not expect President Vladimir V. Putin to stop. The Russian leader wants to seize a swathe of the country from the city of Kharkiv in the northeast to Odessa in the southwest, he said.\n\u201cHe will not calm down,\u201d he said. \u201cHe will fight for a year, two, three, until he reaches his goal.\u201d\nMr. Chaplik has been slaughtering his pigs, so only one remains, slumbering in his pen. The newborn calves will have to be slaughtered too, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\u201d\nIf the Russians came, he added, he would have to leave his guard dogs, six German shepherds. \u201cI could not bear to put them down,\u201d he said. \u201cI will let them loose.\u201d\nIf the shells came too close, he would take his workers and leave, he said. \u201cI will start anew,\u201d he said. \u201cGive me a little piece of land, in Ukraine, in the United States, wherever. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">I can build a great business again.\u201d\n</span>Reporting from Seoul\nAn air-launched cruise missile hit the Odesa region on Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea coast early Saturday morning, Odesa city officials said on Telegram. The missile struck a mostly agricultural area with warehouses, injuring two people, according to the officials.\nReporting from Seoul\nRussia\u2019s recent use of airstrikes and artillery fire has been a factor in its limited success in Ukraine\u2019s east, a contrast with its largely ineffective air attacks earlier in the war, the British Defense Ministry said. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The Russian reliance on deep strikes has probably depleted the country\u2019s stock of precision-guided missiles, leading to more use of unguided munitions that can cause substantial civilian casualties, the ministry said.\n</span>Reporting from Seoul\nUkrainian troops engaging in a block-by-block fight for the city of Sievierodonetsk, the last major pocket of Ukrainian control in Luhansk Province, have managed to push back Russian forces <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 20 percent</span></span>, the regional military administrator, Serhiy Haidai, said in a television interview.

Russia\u2019s retreat from those areas has made them more accessible for clear-up operations, the report said.\nIn his nightly address, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine also used the 100th day of war as a way of focusing on how numbers have come to define the war: the number of those killed or wounded, or the number of attacks launched against the country. Particularly haunting is the number of children who have been killed in the war, which Mr. Zelensky said <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 261 as</span> of Friday morning, a number that could not be independently identified. \u201cFor what?\" Mr. Zelensky asked. \u201cThere are no words that can answer this question.\u201d\nJens Stoltenberg, NATO\u2019s secretary general, said in a Twitter message that he had met with Prime Minister Sanna Marin of Finland while the two officials were in Washington on Friday and discussed Finland\u2019s application to NATO.

The sooner the parties engage in good-faith diplomatic efforts to end this war, the better for the sake of Ukraine, Russia and the world,\u201d said Mr. Guterres in a statement on Friday. He said the U.N. stands ready to help in those efforts.\nRENO, Nev. \u2014 President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called out several American cities for having sister cities in Russia during a video address to the United States Conference of Mayors meeting on Friday.\nMr. Zelensky, who spoke to the gathering of mayors just after Vice President Kamala Harris, criticized Chicago; Jacksonville, Fla.; Portland, Ore.; San Diego and San Jose, Calif., for maintaining sister-city ties in Russia. He said those relationships should be severed.\n\u201cWhat do those ties give to you? Probably nothing,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said. \u201cBut they allow Russia to say that it is not isolated.\u201d\nChicago announced earlier this year that it was suspending, but not permanently ending, its sister-city relationship with Moscow, which had been in place <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1997.</span> Local outlets in San Jose reported earlier this year that city leaders decided to maintain a sister-city relationship with Ekaterinburg, Russia. As of Friday, websites for the sister-city programs in Portland, San Diego and Jacksonville continued to list Russian partners.\nMany American municipalities have sister-city relationships in several countries. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Though the partnerships can include business and political exchanges, the relationships are largely symbolic and are sometimes administered by local nonprofit organizations.\n</span>But Mr. Zelensky, who spoke to the mayors<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 100 Days</span> after Russia invaded his country, said it was wrong to give Russia even the smallest bit of added credibility.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cDon\u2019t make any excuses; don\u2019t maintain relations with Russia,\u201d said Mr. Zelensky, whose speech received applause from the mayors and city employees who had gathered in Reno, Nev. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t let those who became murderers call your cities their sister cities.\u201d\n</span>Officials in Portland referred to a statement from Sister Cities International urging cities not to sever ties with their Russian partners. Officials in the other American cities that Mr. Zelensky named did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe nightly address from President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Friday was an impassioned one, reflecting on how<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 100 Days</span> of war has dramatically altered the country\u2019s vocabulary, redefining or introducing new words, terms and phrases into Ukrainians\u2019 everyday language. \"One hundred days -- one hundred words,\" he said, as he listed the words as a way to look back at more than three months of war. Justice, heroes, reconstruction, security and liberation are among the words guiding the country forward and giving it hope, Mr. Zelensky said, including what he referred to as the three most important words underpinning their fight: \u201cpeace, victory, Ukraine.\u201d\nMr. Zelensky added that he hopes many words that have become common in Ukraine will one day be relegated to the past. Words such as filtration, deportation and torture. But he also used the milestone to offer inspiration. \u201cWhen we hear the word \u2018Patron,\u2019 we remember the most famous sapper of Ukraine,\u201d he said, referring to the bomb-sniffing dog he awarded with state honors last month.\nDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 A meeting on Friday between the head of the African Union and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia highlighted the acute needs each one hopes the other can fill: Africa needs food, and the Kremlin needs allies.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Russia\u2019s blockade of Ukraine, ordinarily a major exporter of grain, has worsened food crises in Africa and the Middle East, and the African Union chief, President Macky Sall of Senegal, said the grain should be freed up.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cOur countries, although they are far from the theater, are victims of this crisis on an economic level,\u201d Mr. Sall said at a joint news conference with Mr. Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.\n</span>At the same time, Mr. Sall told Mr. Putin, whom he called his \u201cdear friend Vladimir,\u201d that Western sanctions on Russia had compounded Africa\u2019s lack of access to grain \u2014 an argument Moscow has been making. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Mr. Sall explicitly called for the lifting of restrictions on exports of Russian wheat and fertilizer.\n</span>Mr. Sall\u2019s comments were something of a diplomatic victory for Mr. Putin. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">European leaders have accused the Russian president of creating a global food crisis by blocking wheat exports and seizing Ukrainian grain, all the while trying to blame shortages on sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union.\n</span>Global food stocks were already low before the invasion, and the war has made the shortfall worse. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">African countries import more <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 40 percent</span> of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">The United Nations says food prices worldwide <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">are 23 percent</span> higher than a year ago, reflecting the tight supply.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The United States and its allies have condemned the invasion of Ukraine and have cut most economic ties to Russia, leaving Moscow with fewer diplomatic and trading partners.\n</span>But Russia has longstanding ties to many African countries, some dating to its Soviet-era support for liberation struggles against colonial rulers. Mr. Putin has cultivated those relations and has so far mitigated criticism from most African countries.\nMr. Putin gathered African leaders in Sochi <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019 and</span> has positioned the continent as key to Russia\u2019s interests, while France and the United States have withdrawn from involvement in some conflicts there.\nWith little investment, Russia has made itself a central player on the continent, becoming Africa\u2019s largest supplier of arms, propping up authoritarian leaders and portraying itself as being on the side of African countries in their fight for more independence from the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia.\n\u201cThose friends and allies Russia needs, it can find them on the African continent, so it wants to keep such relations tight,\u201d said Pauline Bax, an expert on Africa with the International Crisis Group.\nStill, such efforts have paid off. Russia has managed to mute criticism of its invasion of Ukraine among leaders in Africa but also in Asia and Latin America.\nIn April, the United Nations General Assembly <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">voted 93 to</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24 to</span> exclude Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council. But most African nations either voted against the measure, abstained or simply did not cast a vote, including countries usually aligned with the views of Western countries, like Senegal, a regional peace broker.\nGilles Yabi, the director of the Wathi research group in Dakar, said the vote created some surprise outside Africa, revealing a perception in the United States and Europe that African countries would not act independently in the crisis.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe ramifications of the conflict for Africa are economic,\u201d Mr. Yabi said.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s legitimate that African countries look at the war according to their interests.\u201d\nAppearing with Mr. Putin on Friday, Mr. Sall claimed, erroneously, that \u201cdespite enormous pressure, the majority of African countries have avoided to condemn Russia in this situation.\u201d At <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 30 of</span> Africa\u2019<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 54 countries</span> have condemned the invasion in some fashion, though generally without the vehemence seen in Washington or European capitals.\nPaul Stronski, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has studied Russia\u2019s relations with Africa, said the United States and Europe liked to think that Russia has been isolated since it invaded Ukraine.\n\u201cMacky Sall\u2019s visit on behalf of the African Union, the votes at the U.N., show that Russia might be isolated from America, Europe, Taiwan and Japan, but necessarily not from the rest of the world,\u201d he said.\nThe African Union has vowed to remain in a neutral position in the conflict, and Mr. Sall has tried to cast himself as a potential mediator. Yet in practice, some analysts say, the African Union has showed deference to Russia.\nThat was evident when, after his talks with Mr. Putin, Mr. Sall was scheduled to fly back to Africa on Friday without meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\nIn addition, Mr. Zelensky has asked for months to address the African Union, and even though Mr. Sall said this week that the Ukrainian leader could soon address the organization in a videoconference, no date has been announced.\nJoseph Siegle, the director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, an arm of the Pentagon\u2019s National Defense University, noted that Mr. Putin has tried to portray his invasion of Ukraine as an ideological battle against the West. That message has resonated across Africa, he said.\nMr. Putin has even used the looming grain shortage to cast the United States and its allies in bad light, he said. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cHe is twisting the narrative to suggest that the sanctions are causing the pain and price inflation for food across the globe, rather than acknowledging that the entire food crisis related to the conflict is his making,\u201d Mr. Siegle said.\n</span>Reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine\nElectrical workers installing a new electricity pole near the village of Kukhari, <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 58 miles</span> northwest of Kyiv.

Grad missiles streaked through the sky from Ukrainian-held territory toward Russian positions.\nRussian forces have been edging ever closer to seizing Sievierodonetsk and taking total control of the Luhansk region, part of the broader area known as Donbas, in eastern Ukraine. Capturing the industrial Donbas region could give Mr. Putin a victory to herald to the Russian people.\nBut Ukraine on Friday was battling to hang on in Sievierodonetsk, underscoring the government\u2019s determination to resist Russia\u2019s onslaught until the arrival of heavier weapons from the West that could potentially help turn the war in its favor.\nThe head of the Ukrainian military administration in the region, Serhiy Haidai, said Friday that at least one person had been killed in Sievierodonetsk and that the battle was ongoing in the heart of the city. He said that Russian forces maintained their grip on a highway that had acted as a conduit both for people seeking to flee the city as well as for incoming supplies.\nThat highway runs southwest from Sievierodonetsk across the Seversky Donets River, through the adjoining city of Lysychansk and on to the city of Bakmut in Donetsk province.\nRussian artillery has targeted the road, as well as several towns and villages along the route, part of Moscow\u2019s bid to tighten its grip on Luhansk, a province where it already holds almost all of the land. Russia has massed its forces in Luhansk and Donetsk provinces in the Donbas region after failing to seize the capital, Kyiv, early in the conflict.\nA British intelligence report said on Friday that Russian forces were \u201cachieving tactical success\u201d in Luhansk and had momentum, noting that they should be able to take full control of the province in the next two weeks. Mr. Haidai has disputed that analysis.\n<span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">The United States, Britain and Germany all said this week they would supply Ukraine with missile systems that the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky had sought to offset Russia\u2019s advantage in long-range artillery.</span> But it is not clear when those weapons will arrive or how a possible new Ukrainian counteroffensive in the coming weeks will take shape.\nUntil then, Ukrainian attempts to slow Moscow\u2019s progress in the Donbas could deplete Russia of both personnel and arms.\n\u201cRussian forces continued to make incremental, grinding, and costly progress in eastern Ukraine,\u201d said a report by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. Local residents and Ukrainian officials in the area of Sievierodonetsk said Friday that Ukrainian forces were still holding their own \u2014 even pushing back some Russian forces.\nOne Ukrainian reporter for Radio Liberty traveled in with the Ukrainian army across the last standing bridge into the city. Two Reuters journalists were wounded and their driver was killed after their vehicle, which had been provided by Russia-backed forces, came under fire while heading to Sievierodonetsk on a Russian-held part of road, according to the news agency.\nReporting from Bakhmut, Ukraine\nAmidst stretchers, camouflage netting and bloodstained medical gear, Ukrainian soldiers were examined by medical personnel at a makeshift aid station in Bakhmut, only a few miles west of the Donetsk and Luhansk regional border, in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.\n<span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Seeking to leverage a global food crisis to get relief from international sanctions, the president of Belarus, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, said on Friday that Ukrainian grain could travel by rail through his country to ports on the Baltic Sea, but only if Belarus is allowed to use the same ports to export its own goods.\n</span>Mr. Lukashenko, a staunch ally of Moscow, made the offer in a telephone conversation with the secretary general of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, according to Belta, the Belarusian state news agency.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Russia has blockaded Ukraine\u2019s ports on the Black Sea, which were previously the main export route for Ukrainian grain and oilseeds.</span> The war has left <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 25 million</span> tons of grain stranded in silos and at risk of rotting away unless it is moved soon.\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">U.N. officials have warned the blockade will cause rising prices and severe food shortages, particularly in Africa, where famines are possible.</span> Moscow has said it would consider letting grain shipments through the Black Sea in return for the lifting of Western sanctions. Ukraine\u2019s allies have been seeking alternative overland routes.\nBelarus controls the railway lines that offer the most direct, cheapest and fastest route for large volumes of grain to be shipped out of Ukraine to the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda and other Baltic ports.\nBut getting access to those rail lines has been complicated because Belarus is allied with Russia in the current conflict. <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Belarus was a staging ground for Russia\u2019s Feb.<span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24 invasion</span> of Ukraine, and Mr. Lukashenko has expressed fury at Western sanctions on what had been his country\u2019s biggest export earner, potash fertilizer.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Belarus, which is landlocked, exported nearly all its potash through the port at Klaipeda until Feb.<span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1,</span> when Lithuania halted the traffic, severing a vital economic artery for Mr. Lukashenko.\n</span>Mr. Lukashenko\u2019s offer to Mr. Guterres seems to be a gambit to restore that lifeline.

Craters from bombs and artillery shells scar his fields. Leaning against the wall of one of his barns stood the casings of a dozen rockets that Mr. Chaplik had collected from around the farm. The rockets delivered cluster bombs, he said, which still littered his hayfields.\n\u201cThey want to be eating grass,\u201d he said as he walked down the stalls of <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 35 dairy</span> cows. \u201cBut I cannot let the cows loose on this grass because of these bombs, and I am scared they will fall in the bomb craters.\u201d\nMr. Chaplik is a fraying connection to the world for his increasingly isolated village, which he asked not be named so it would not suffer retribution from Russian troops. At considerable risk to himself, he provides vital supplies and information, and keeps producing food as best he can.\nMany other farmers have left the area but he said he could not. \u201cI can\u2019t leave the people,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I leave, I will not be able to return to the village, I will not be able to look people in the eye.\u201d\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">But as the war has crept closer, he has had to shrink his business while trying to keep the farm producing and workers fed and paid.</span> With utilities cut off, he runs the milk machines on generators, but can only operate his refrigerators <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 12 hours</span> a day.\n\u201cWe used to make <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 100 different</span> milk products,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a two-years-old Parmesan cheese. I made unique products that no one else was making, sour cream, cream, mozzarella, burrata.\u201d\nBut without electricity he has had to cut down on production. There was a shortage of containers, he added. He removed two cheeses with moldy rinds from a fridge. \u201cThey are no good,\u201d he said.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">He has moved his food production operations to several different parts of the country, placing part of his dairy production in the nearby market town of Bakhmut, where he already has an organic meat and dairy shop, and relocating his meat production plants to the relatively safe cities of Dnipro and Lviv.\n</span>His family has moved, too. His wife is a teacher and two of his children are university students, so they needed to go somewhere with the internet to be able to keep working, he said. They were calling him daily, pleading with him to join them, but he said he still had work to do.\nHis work force has contracted, as many villagers left with their families for safer parts of the country. \u201cI have fields and machines and diesel but I do not have the workers,\u201d he said. But he pulled together <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 10 workers</span> who remained, so they now live and eat together.\nTwo teenage girls were mucking out the cow stalls. \u201cThey are the daughters of my workers. They are children, but I have no workers,\u201d he said.\nA pensioner, Lyudmila,<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 68,</span> has stepped in to run his shop in the village.\n\u201cDid you get cucumbers?\u201d she called out, as Mr. Chaplik unloaded bottled water and fresh vegetables from his van.\n\u201cWithout him we would be lost,\u201d she said. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Villagers could not travel to the market, and prices there were much higher anyway, she said.\n</span>But the strain shows on Mr. Chaplik\u2019s face. He looks like he has not slept in days. He complained of toothache and a twitch around his eye. One of the hardest things, he said, was fielding the panicked telephone calls from relatives trying to reach the villagers who have remained behind. The cellphone service in the village has been knocked out <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">but they know that Mr. Chaplik drives into town every day to the market, where cell service continues, and they bombard him with calls.\n</span>\u201cMy nerves are cracking,\u201d he said, as he declined another phone call. \u201cI am <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">working 14 to</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 15 hours</span> a day. Physically I am tired.\u201d\nSo now he is arranging for his son to bring in a mobile antenna, so the villagers can be in touch with their relatives.\nHe sees more problems on the horizon. The war has disrupted farming and food production to such an extent that people in eastern Ukraine could go hungry in coming months, he warned.\nThe potatoes are already planted, which will provide food for the villagers, he said, but meat and milk will become scarce.\n\u201cIf I do not prepare feed for my cows they will die this winter,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot cut the hay because of the cluster bombs in the fields and I <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">need 12,000 bales</span> of hay and I do not have the workers.\u201d\nAnd as he follows the progress of the war, and the steady advance of Russian troops, he said it was likely that they would seize control of the village and he would lose the farm that he built up over more <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 20 years</span>.\nSeparatist forces backed by Russia seized the area <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014 but</span> were pushed back after a few months. But this time he said he did not expect President Vladimir V. Putin to stop. The Russian leader wants to seize a swathe of the country from the city of Kharkiv in the northeast to Odessa in the southwest, he said.\n\u201cHe will not calm down,\u201d he said. \u201cHe will fight for a year, two, three, until he reaches his goal.\u201d\nMr. Chaplik has been slaughtering his pigs, so only one remains, slumbering in his pen. The newborn calves will have to be slaughtered too, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\u201d\nIf the Russians came, he added, he would have to leave his guard dogs, six German shepherds. \u201cI could not bear to put them down,\u201d he said. \u201cI will let them loose.\u201d\nIf the shells came too close, he would take his workers and leave, he said. \u201cI will start anew,\u201d he said. \u201cGive me a little piece of land, in Ukraine, in the United States, wherever. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">I can build a great business again.\u201d\n</span>Reporting from Seoul\nAn air-launched cruise missile hit the Odesa region on Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea coast early Saturday morning, Odesa city officials said on Telegram. The missile struck a mostly agricultural area with warehouses, injuring two people, according to the officials.\nReporting from Seoul\nRussia\u2019s recent use of airstrikes and artillery fire has been a factor in its limited success in Ukraine\u2019s east, a contrast with its largely ineffective air attacks earlier in the war, the British Defense Ministry said. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The Russian reliance on deep strikes has probably depleted the country\u2019s stock of precision-guided missiles, leading to more use of unguided munitions that can cause substantial civilian casualties, the ministry said.\n</span>Reporting from Seoul\nUkrainian troops engaging in a block-by-block fight for the city of Sievierodonetsk, the last major pocket of Ukrainian control in Luhansk Province, have managed to push back Russian forces <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 20 percent</span></span>, the regional military administrator, Serhiy Haidai, said in a television interview.

Russia\u2019s retreat from those areas has made them more accessible for clear-up operations, the report said.\nIn his nightly address, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine also used the 100th day of war as a way of focusing on how numbers have come to define the war: the number of those killed or wounded, or the number of attacks launched against the country. Particularly haunting is the number of children who have been killed in the war, which Mr. Zelensky said <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 261 as</span> of Friday morning, a number that could not be independently identified. \u201cFor what?\" Mr. Zelensky asked. \u201cThere are no words that can answer this question.\u201d\nJens Stoltenberg, NATO\u2019s secretary general, said in a Twitter message that he had met with Prime Minister Sanna Marin of Finland while the two officials were in Washington on Friday and discussed Finland\u2019s application to NATO.

The sooner the parties engage in good-faith diplomatic efforts to end this war, the better for the sake of Ukraine, Russia and the world,\u201d said Mr. Guterres in a statement on Friday. He said the U.N. stands ready to help in those efforts.\nRENO, Nev. \u2014 President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called out several American cities for having sister cities in Russia during a video address to the United States Conference of Mayors meeting on Friday.\nMr. Zelensky, who spoke to the gathering of mayors just after Vice President Kamala Harris, criticized Chicago; Jacksonville, Fla.; Portland, Ore.; San Diego and San Jose, Calif., for maintaining sister-city ties in Russia. He said those relationships should be severed.\n\u201cWhat do those ties give to you? Probably nothing,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said. \u201cBut they allow Russia to say that it is not isolated.\u201d\nChicago announced earlier this year that it was suspending, but not permanently ending, its sister-city relationship with Moscow, which had been in place <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1997.</span> Local outlets in San Jose reported earlier this year that city leaders decided to maintain a sister-city relationship with Ekaterinburg, Russia. As of Friday, websites for the sister-city programs in Portland, San Diego and Jacksonville continued to list Russian partners.\nMany American municipalities have sister-city relationships in several countries. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Though the partnerships can include business and political exchanges, the relationships are largely symbolic and are sometimes administered by local nonprofit organizations.\n</span>But Mr. Zelensky, who spoke to the mayors<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 100 Days</span> after Russia invaded his country, said it was wrong to give Russia even the smallest bit of added credibility.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cDon\u2019t make any excuses; don\u2019t maintain relations with Russia,\u201d said Mr. Zelensky, whose speech received applause from the mayors and city employees who had gathered in Reno, Nev. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t let those who became murderers call your cities their sister cities.\u201d\n</span>Officials in Portland referred to a statement from Sister Cities International urging cities not to sever ties with their Russian partners. Officials in the other American cities that Mr. Zelensky named did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe nightly address from President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Friday was an impassioned one, reflecting on how<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 100 Days</span> of war has dramatically altered the country\u2019s vocabulary, redefining or introducing new words, terms and phrases into Ukrainians\u2019 everyday language. \"One hundred days -- one hundred words,\" he said, as he listed the words as a way to look back at more than three months of war. Justice, heroes, reconstruction, security and liberation are among the words guiding the country forward and giving it hope, Mr. Zelensky said, including what he referred to as the three most important words underpinning their fight: \u201cpeace, victory, Ukraine.\u201d\nMr. Zelensky added that he hopes many words that have become common in Ukraine will one day be relegated to the past. Words such as filtration, deportation and torture. But he also used the milestone to offer inspiration. \u201cWhen we hear the word \u2018Patron,\u2019 we remember the most famous sapper of Ukraine,\u201d he said, referring to the bomb-sniffing dog he awarded with state honors last month.\nDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 A meeting on Friday between the head of the African Union and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia highlighted the acute needs each one hopes the other can fill: Africa needs food, and the Kremlin needs allies.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Russia\u2019s blockade of Ukraine, ordinarily a major exporter of grain, has worsened food crises in Africa and the Middle East, and the African Union chief, President Macky Sall of Senegal, said the grain should be freed up.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cOur countries, although they are far from the theater, are victims of this crisis on an economic level,\u201d Mr. Sall said at a joint news conference with Mr. Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.\n</span>At the same time, Mr. Sall told Mr. Putin, whom he called his \u201cdear friend Vladimir,\u201d that Western sanctions on Russia had compounded Africa\u2019s lack of access to grain \u2014 an argument Moscow has been making. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Mr. Sall explicitly called for the lifting of restrictions on exports of Russian wheat and fertilizer.\n</span>Mr. Sall\u2019s comments were something of a diplomatic victory for Mr. Putin. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">European leaders have accused the Russian president of creating a global food crisis by blocking wheat exports and seizing Ukrainian grain, all the while trying to blame shortages on sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union.\n</span>Global food stocks were already low before the invasion, and the war has made the shortfall worse. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">African countries import more <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 40 percent</span> of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">The United Nations says food prices worldwide <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">are 23 percent</span> higher than a year ago, reflecting the tight supply.\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The United States and its allies have condemned the invasion of Ukraine and have cut most economic ties to Russia, leaving Moscow with fewer diplomatic and trading partners.\n</span>But Russia has longstanding ties to many African countries, some dating to its Soviet-era support for liberation struggles against colonial rulers. Mr. Putin has cultivated those relations and has so far mitigated criticism from most African countries.\nMr. Putin gathered African leaders in Sochi <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019 and</span> has positioned the continent as key to Russia\u2019s interests, while France and the United States have withdrawn from involvement in some conflicts there.\nWith little investment, Russia has made itself a central player on the continent, becoming Africa\u2019s largest supplier of arms, propping up authoritarian leaders and portraying itself as being on the side of African countries in their fight for more independence from the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia.\n\u201cThose friends and allies Russia needs, it can find them on the African continent, so it wants to keep such relations tight,\u201d said Pauline Bax, an expert on Africa with the International Crisis Group.\nStill, such efforts have paid off. Russia has managed to mute criticism of its invasion of Ukraine among leaders in Africa but also in Asia and Latin America.\nIn April, the United Nations General Assembly <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">voted 93 to</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24 to</span> exclude Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council. But most African nations either voted against the measure, abstained or simply did not cast a vote, including countries usually aligned with the views of Western countries, like Senegal, a regional peace broker.\nGilles Yabi, the director of the Wathi research group in Dakar, said the vote created some surprise outside Africa, revealing a perception in the United States and Europe that African countries would not act independently in the crisis.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe ramifications of the conflict for Africa are economic,\u201d Mr. Yabi said.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s legitimate that African countries look at the war according to their interests.\u201d\nAppearing with Mr. Putin on Friday, Mr. Sall claimed, erroneously, that \u201cdespite enormous pressure, the majority of African countries have avoided to condemn Russia in this situation.\u201d At <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 30 of</span> Africa\u2019<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 54 countries</span> have condemned the invasion in some fashion, though generally without the vehemence seen in Washington or European capitals.\nPaul Stronski, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has studied Russia\u2019s relations with Africa, said the United States and Europe liked to think that Russia has been isolated since it invaded Ukraine.\n\u201cMacky Sall\u2019s visit on behalf of the African Union, the votes at the U.N., show that Russia might be isolated from America, Europe, Taiwan and Japan, but necessarily not from the rest of the world,\u201d he said.\nThe African Union has vowed to remain in a neutral position in the conflict, and Mr. Sall has tried to cast himself as a potential mediator. Yet in practice, some analysts say, the African Union has showed deference to Russia.\nThat was evident when, after his talks with Mr. Putin, Mr. Sall was scheduled to fly back to Africa on Friday without meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\nIn addition, Mr. Zelensky has asked for months to address the African Union, and even though Mr. Sall said this week that the Ukrainian leader could soon address the organization in a videoconference, no date has been announced.\nJoseph Siegle, the director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, an arm of the Pentagon\u2019s National Defense University, noted that Mr. Putin has tried to portray his invasion of Ukraine as an ideological battle against the West. That message has resonated across Africa, he said.\nMr. Putin has even used the looming grain shortage to cast the United States and its allies in bad light, he said. <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cHe is twisting the narrative to suggest that the sanctions are causing the pain and price inflation for food across the globe, rather than acknowledging that the entire food crisis related to the conflict is his making,\u201d Mr. Siegle said.\n</span>Reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine\nElectrical workers installing a new electricity pole near the village of Kukhari, <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 58 miles</span> northwest of Kyiv.

Grad missiles streaked through the sky from Ukrainian-held territory toward Russian positions.\nRussian forces have been edging ever closer to seizing Sievierodonetsk and taking total control of the Luhansk region, part of the broader area known as Donbas, in eastern Ukraine. Capturing the industrial Donbas region could give Mr. Putin a victory to herald to the Russian people.\nBut Ukraine on Friday was battling to hang on in Sievierodonetsk, underscoring the government\u2019s determination to resist Russia\u2019s onslaught until the arrival of heavier weapons from the West that could potentially help turn the war in its favor.\nThe head of the Ukrainian military administration in the region, Serhiy Haidai, said Friday that at least one person had been killed in Sievierodonetsk and that the battle was ongoing in the heart of the city. He said that Russian forces maintained their grip on a highway that had acted as a conduit both for people seeking to flee the city as well as for incoming supplies.\nThat highway runs southwest from Sievierodonetsk across the Seversky Donets River, through the adjoining city of Lysychansk and on to the city of Bakmut in Donetsk province.\nRussian artillery has targeted the road, as well as several towns and villages along the route, part of Moscow\u2019s bid to tighten its grip on Luhansk, a province where it already holds almost all of the land. Russia has massed its forces in Luhansk and Donetsk provinces in the Donbas region after failing to seize the capital, Kyiv, early in the conflict.\nA British intelligence report said on Friday that Russian forces were \u201cachieving tactical success\u201d in Luhansk and had momentum, noting that they should be able to take full control of the province in the next two weeks. Mr. Haidai has disputed that analysis.\n<span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">The United States, Britain and Germany all said this week they would supply Ukraine with missile systems that the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky had sought to offset Russia\u2019s advantage in long-range artillery.</span> But it is not clear when those weapons will arrive or how a possible new Ukrainian counteroffensive in the coming weeks will take shape.\nUntil then, Ukrainian attempts to slow Moscow\u2019s progress in the Donbas could deplete Russia of both personnel and arms.\n\u201cRussian forces continued to make incremental, grinding, and costly progress in eastern Ukraine,\u201d said a report by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. Local residents and Ukrainian officials in the area of Sievierodonetsk said Friday that Ukrainian forces were still holding their own \u2014 even pushing back some Russian forces.\nOne Ukrainian reporter for Radio Liberty traveled in with the Ukrainian army across the last standing bridge into the city. Two Reuters journalists were wounded and their driver was killed after their vehicle, which had been provided by Russia-backed forces, came under fire while heading to Sievierodonetsk on a Russian-held part of road, according to the news agency.\nReporting from Bakhmut, Ukraine\nAmidst stretchers, camouflage netting and bloodstained medical gear, Ukrainian soldiers were examined by medical personnel at a makeshift aid station in Bakhmut, only a few miles west of the Donetsk and Luhansk regional border, in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.\n<span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Seeking to leverage a global food crisis to get relief from international sanctions, the president of Belarus, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, said on Friday that Ukrainian grain could travel by rail through his country to ports on the Baltic Sea, but only if Belarus is allowed to use the same ports to export its own goods.\n</span>Mr. Lukashenko, a staunch ally of Moscow, made the offer in a telephone conversation with the secretary general of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, according to Belta, the Belarusian state news agency.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Russia has blockaded Ukraine\u2019s ports on the Black Sea, which were previously the main export route for Ukrainian grain and oilseeds.</span> The war has left <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 25 million</span> tons of grain stranded in silos and at risk of rotting away unless it is moved soon.\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">U.N. officials have warned the blockade will cause rising prices and severe food shortages, particularly in Africa, where famines are possible.</span> Moscow has said it would consider letting grain shipments through the Black Sea in return for the lifting of Western sanctions. Ukraine\u2019s allies have been seeking alternative overland routes.\nBelarus controls the railway lines that offer the most direct, cheapest and fastest route for large volumes of grain to be shipped out of Ukraine to the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda and other Baltic ports.\nBut getting access to those rail lines has been complicated because Belarus is allied with Russia in the current conflict. <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Belarus was a staging ground for Russia\u2019s Feb.<span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24 invasion</span> of Ukraine, and Mr. Lukashenko has expressed fury at Western sanctions on what had been his country\u2019s biggest export earner, potash fertilizer.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Belarus, which is landlocked, exported nearly all its potash through the port at Klaipeda until Feb.<span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1,</span> when Lithuania halted the traffic, severing a vital economic artery for Mr. Lukashenko.\n</span>Mr. Lukashenko\u2019s offer to Mr. Guterres seems to be a gambit to restore that lifeline.

This is a recent former statewide officeholder \u2014 one <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">whose 2014 outsider</span> Senate campaign was viewed as something of a model for the party. \u2026 While Perdue\u2019s failed comeback is surely among the worst in recent history, losing such a bid is hardly without precedent.Just earlier this month, former North Carolina governor Pat McCrory (R) attempted one in the state\u2019s open Senate race after losing reelection <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016.</span> He lost to Rep.

(The primary is in three weeks.)\nAaron notes, though, that it\u2019s difficult to find other comeback candidates who fared so poorly in their party\u2019s primaries in recent years.

The Post\u2019s Aaron Blake offers an assessment:\nThe scale of that loss shouldn\u2019t be undersold. This is a recent former statewide officeholder \u2014 one <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">whose 2014 outsider</span> Senate campaign was viewed as something of a model for the party. \u2026 While Perdue\u2019s failed comeback is surely among the worst in recent history, losing such a bid is hardly without precedent.Just earlier this month, former North Carolina governor Pat McCrory (R) attempted one in the state\u2019s open Senate race after losing reelection <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016.</span> He lost to Rep.

(The primary is in three weeks.)\nAaron notes, though, that it\u2019s difficult to find other comeback candidates who fared so poorly in their party\u2019s primaries in recent years.

That figure has shot up <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 42 percent</span> in the last two weeks, and by more than twentyfold since early July.\nOn Wednesday, the state said it had activated \u201ccrisis standards of care,\u201d giving hospitals legal protections for triage decisions that force them to give some patients substandard care. The state also announced <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an $87 million</span> contract to bring in hundreds of temporary health care workers.\nGov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, said that while hospitals were strained, he did not see a need to implement restrictions aimed at curbing transmission. Still, he encouraged people who had not yet received a vaccination to seriously consider it.\n\u201cWe have the tools available to us for individuals to be able to take care of themselves,\u201d Mr. Dunleavy said. While the state led the nation in vaccinations early in the year, it has been lagging in recent months, with under half of its population fully vaccinated, compared <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 55 percent</span> nationally, according to federal data.\nJared Kosin, the head of the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association, called the surge \u201ccrippling\u201d in an interview on Tuesday. He added that hospitals were full, and health care workers were emotionally depleted. Patients recently were kept waiting for care in their cars outside overwhelmed emergency rooms.\nThere is growing anxiety in outlying communities that depend on transferring seriously ill patients to hospitals in Anchorage, Mr. Kosin said. Transfers are getting harder to arrange and are often delayed, he said.\n\u201cWe are all wondering where this goes, and whether that transfer will be available, even tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Kosin said.\nCritically ill people in rural areas, where many Alaska Natives reside, often have to be taken by plane to a hospital that can provide the treatment they need, said Dr. Philippe Amstislavski, an associate professor of public health at the University of Alaska Anchorage.\n\u201cUnlike in the <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lower 48,</span> you don\u2019t have that ability to move people quickly, because of the distances and remoteness,\u201d said Dr. Amstislavski, who was formerly the public health manager for the Interior Region of Alaska, focusing on rural and predominantly Alaska Native communities.\nMr. Kosin said that if hospitalizations rise much further, hospitals and clinics around the state could be forced to apply crisis standards of care and more extreme triage decisions. \u201cThat is the worst-case scenario we could be heading to,\u201d he said.\nAlaska Natives, who have historically suffered from health disparities in the state, are disproportionately struggling during the latest virus wave, Dr. Amstislavski said.\nDr. Anne Zink, Alaska\u2019s chief medical officer, said several factors may be contributing to the surge, including summer tourists bringing in and spreading the virus.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that as the snow falls and we have less people visiting, those numbers will settle down,\u201d Dr. Zink said in an interview Tuesday night.\nOn the other hand, she noted that cooling weather drives residents indoors, where the virus spreads more readily.\nThe state\u2019s Canadian neighbors to the east, Yukon and British Columbia, have not suffered such severe outbreaks, Dr. Amstislavski said, possibly because of that country\u2019s stricter travel restrictions and less strained health care system.\nAdvertisement\nThe C.D.C. chief overruled her own agency\u2019s panel and recommended Pfizer boosters for workers at risk.\nThe director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday overruled a recommendation by an agency advisory panel that had refused to endorse booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine for frontline workers. It was a highly unusual move for the director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, but aligned C.D.C. policy with the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s endorsements over her own agency\u2019s advisers.\nThe C.D.C.\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday recommended the boosters for a wide range of Americans, including tens of millions of older adults and younger people at high risk for the disease. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">But they excluded health care workers, teachers and others whose jobs put them at risk.</span> That put their recommendations at odds with the F.D.A.\u2019s authorization of booster shots for all adults with a high occupational risk.\nDr. Walensky\u2019s decision was a boost for President Biden\u2019s campaign to give a broad swathe of Americans access to boosters. The White House had come under criticism for getting ahead of the regulatory process.\nThe C.D.C.\u2019s statement arrived well past midnight, a sign of the complicated and confusing decision-making surrounding the boosters. The C.D.C. advisers similarly spent two days debating who should get boosters and when, and could not agree on whether occupational risk should qualify as a criterion.\n\u201cI am surprised that Dr. Walensky overturned one of the four A.C.I.P. votes today, and I believe others will be as well,\u201d said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious disease expert at Stanford and the American Academy of Pediatrics liaison to the committee.\nBut the vote on boosters for occupational risk \u201cwas close,\u201d Dr. Maldonado said, and agreed with Dr. Walensky\u2019s decision.\n\u201cThis addresses not only waning immunity but those at high risk of exposure,\u201d Dr. Maldonado added.\nMinutes before Dr. Walensky\u2019s statement, Dr. Amanda Cohn, who oversaw the two-day meeting of the panel, tried to prepare the advisers for the director\u2019s decision.\n\u201cDr. Walensky is reversing the decision to not recommend use of a booster dose in persons at high risk for occupational or institutional exposure,\u201d Dr. Cohn wrote in the email. \u201cI am hoping to share this news with you before you see it in the press.\u201d\nDr. Walensky\u2019s decision to go against her own agency\u2019s advisers came as a surprise to at least some of her staff members: The C.D.C. director\u2019s endorsement of the advisory committee\u2019s recommendations is typically just a formality. Hours before her statement, agency insiders predicted she would stick with the usual protocol because doing otherwise would undermine the process and upset the advisers as well as her own staff.\nBut experts outside the C.D.C. said Dr. Walensky may have had no choice but to align herself with the F.D.A.\u2019s decision. \u201cThere\u2019s a complexity here, because Dr. Walensky was part of the White House announcement\u201d on boosters, noted Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Dr. Walensky said providing booster shots to health care workers and others who risk contracting the disease on the job would \u201cbest serve the nation\u2019s public health needs.\u201d\n</span>SEOUL \u2014 South Korea reported its highest number of new coronavirus infections for a single day on Friday, soon after a long holiday weekend.\nThe Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reported 2,434 new</span> infections, surpassing the previous record <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2,221 infectionsset</span> last month.\nAt a briefing on Friday, health officials said the spike was partly because of the Chuseok holiday, when many people traveled across the country and spent time with friends and family.

That figure has shot up <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 42 percent</span> in the last two weeks, and by more than twentyfold since early July.\nOn Wednesday, the state said it had activated \u201ccrisis standards of care,\u201d giving hospitals legal protections for triage decisions that force them to give some patients substandard care. The state also announced <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an $87 million</span> contract to bring in hundreds of temporary health care workers.\nGov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, said that while hospitals were strained, he did not see a need to implement restrictions aimed at curbing transmission. Still, he encouraged people who had not yet received a vaccination to seriously consider it.\n\u201cWe have the tools available to us for individuals to be able to take care of themselves,\u201d Mr. Dunleavy said. While the state led the nation in vaccinations early in the year, it has been lagging in recent months, with under half of its population fully vaccinated, compared <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 55 percent</span> nationally, according to federal data.\nJared Kosin, the head of the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association, called the surge \u201ccrippling\u201d in an interview on Tuesday. He added that hospitals were full, and health care workers were emotionally depleted. Patients recently were kept waiting for care in their cars outside overwhelmed emergency rooms.\nThere is growing anxiety in outlying communities that depend on transferring seriously ill patients to hospitals in Anchorage, Mr. Kosin said. Transfers are getting harder to arrange and are often delayed, he said.\n\u201cWe are all wondering where this goes, and whether that transfer will be available, even tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Kosin said.\nCritically ill people in rural areas, where many Alaska Natives reside, often have to be taken by plane to a hospital that can provide the treatment they need, said Dr. Philippe Amstislavski, an associate professor of public health at the University of Alaska Anchorage.\n\u201cUnlike in the <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">lower 48,</span> you don\u2019t have that ability to move people quickly, because of the distances and remoteness,\u201d said Dr. Amstislavski, who was formerly the public health manager for the Interior Region of Alaska, focusing on rural and predominantly Alaska Native communities.\nMr. Kosin said that if hospitalizations rise much further, hospitals and clinics around the state could be forced to apply crisis standards of care and more extreme triage decisions. \u201cThat is the worst-case scenario we could be heading to,\u201d he said.\nAlaska Natives, who have historically suffered from health disparities in the state, are disproportionately struggling during the latest virus wave, Dr. Amstislavski said.\nDr. Anne Zink, Alaska\u2019s chief medical officer, said several factors may be contributing to the surge, including summer tourists bringing in and spreading the virus.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that as the snow falls and we have less people visiting, those numbers will settle down,\u201d Dr. Zink said in an interview Tuesday night.\nOn the other hand, she noted that cooling weather drives residents indoors, where the virus spreads more readily.\nThe state\u2019s Canadian neighbors to the east, Yukon and British Columbia, have not suffered such severe outbreaks, Dr. Amstislavski said, possibly because of that country\u2019s stricter travel restrictions and less strained health care system.\nAdvertisement\nThe C.D.C. chief overruled her own agency\u2019s panel and recommended Pfizer boosters for workers at risk.\nThe director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday overruled a recommendation by an agency advisory panel that had refused to endorse booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine for frontline workers. It was a highly unusual move for the director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, but aligned C.D.C. policy with the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s endorsements over her own agency\u2019s advisers.\nThe C.D.C.\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday recommended the boosters for a wide range of Americans, including tens of millions of older adults and younger people at high risk for the disease. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">But they excluded health care workers, teachers and others whose jobs put them at risk.</span> That put their recommendations at odds with the F.D.A.\u2019s authorization of booster shots for all adults with a high occupational risk.\nDr. Walensky\u2019s decision was a boost for President Biden\u2019s campaign to give a broad swathe of Americans access to boosters. The White House had come under criticism for getting ahead of the regulatory process.\nThe C.D.C.\u2019s statement arrived well past midnight, a sign of the complicated and confusing decision-making surrounding the boosters. The C.D.C. advisers similarly spent two days debating who should get boosters and when, and could not agree on whether occupational risk should qualify as a criterion.\n\u201cI am surprised that Dr. Walensky overturned one of the four A.C.I.P. votes today, and I believe others will be as well,\u201d said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious disease expert at Stanford and the American Academy of Pediatrics liaison to the committee.\nBut the vote on boosters for occupational risk \u201cwas close,\u201d Dr. Maldonado said, and agreed with Dr. Walensky\u2019s decision.\n\u201cThis addresses not only waning immunity but those at high risk of exposure,\u201d Dr. Maldonado added.\nMinutes before Dr. Walensky\u2019s statement, Dr. Amanda Cohn, who oversaw the two-day meeting of the panel, tried to prepare the advisers for the director\u2019s decision.\n\u201cDr. Walensky is reversing the decision to not recommend use of a booster dose in persons at high risk for occupational or institutional exposure,\u201d Dr. Cohn wrote in the email. \u201cI am hoping to share this news with you before you see it in the press.\u201d\nDr. Walensky\u2019s decision to go against her own agency\u2019s advisers came as a surprise to at least some of her staff members: The C.D.C. director\u2019s endorsement of the advisory committee\u2019s recommendations is typically just a formality. Hours before her statement, agency insiders predicted she would stick with the usual protocol because doing otherwise would undermine the process and upset the advisers as well as her own staff.\nBut experts outside the C.D.C. said Dr. Walensky may have had no choice but to align herself with the F.D.A.\u2019s decision. \u201cThere\u2019s a complexity here, because Dr. Walensky was part of the White House announcement\u201d on boosters, noted Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Dr. Walensky said providing booster shots to health care workers and others who risk contracting the disease on the job would \u201cbest serve the nation\u2019s public health needs.\u201d\n</span>SEOUL \u2014 South Korea reported its highest number of new coronavirus infections for a single day on Friday, soon after a long holiday weekend.\nThe Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reported 2,434 new</span> infections, surpassing the previous record <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2,221 infectionsset</span> last month.\nAt a briefing on Friday, health officials said the spike was partly because of the Chuseok holiday, when many people traveled across the country and spent time with friends and family. The government is encouraging people to get tested following the holiday.\nChuseok is roughly equivalent to American Thanksgiving and was observed from Monday through Wednesday. The Korea Transport Institute estimated that <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 32 million</span> people would travel over the holiday.\nOver the past week the nation was averaging <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 1,500 new</span> cases a day, according to statistics collected by Our World in Data. Most cases are concentrated in the capital, Seoul, and surrounding areas, but officials were concerned that the holiday would spread the virus more widely.\nTesting and quarantining were the main tools South Korea used to curb the spread of the disease, and the country was able to keep outbreaks at bay in the early part of the pandemic.\nSouth Korea\u2019s vaccination program got off to a slow start, but the country has now <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">vaccinated 43 percent</span> of its population. It hopes to <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">have 70 percent</span> of its population inoculated by October.\n\u201cThere is no problem at all with the amount of vaccines secured for this year,\u201d President Moon Jae-in said on Friday, according to Reuters. \u201cThe vaccine shipment got off to a slower start than other countries, which delayed the vaccination program, but I believe by next month, we will catch up and be a leading country by inoculation rate.\u201d\nA few weeks ago the government relaxed several restrictions on in-person meetings. For Chuseok, family gatherings of up to eight people were permitted if at least four people were fully vaccinated.\nAdvertisement\nHospitals near a grocery store shooting in Collierville, Tenn., were already struggling to keep up with Covid-19 patients when those injured in the attack arrived in emergency rooms on Thursday.\nNational Guard troops had been stationed at medical centers to help cope with the influx of Covid-19 patients, and emergency medical providers had recently issued a dire warning to local officials about the strain on hospitals.\n\u201cCurrently our system emergency departments are operating dangerously over capacity,\u201d the medical providers wrote on Aug.<span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16.</span> They added, \u201cWe may be unable to provide timely care to everyone and will have to make choices about delivering care to patients based on their probability of survival.\u201d\nThey expressed particular concern about what could happen in the event of a disaster, given that \u201cthe city has no surge capacity to accommodate any additional disaster or unplanned events.\u201d\nAn average <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 96 percent</span> of I.C.U. beds were occupied in Shelby County, Tenn., on Thursday, according to New York Times data.

She said the hospital had the capacity to accommodate those patients. Baptist Memorial Hospital in Collierville received one patient, who was discharged, and Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis received two, according to a spokeswoman.\nShelby County reported its highest number of Covid-19 cases during the pandemic last month.

Melbourne\u2019s playgrounds were wrapped in police tape, and traveling from a state with Covid restrictions to one without \u2014 for the lucky few granted permission by the authorities \u2014 requires two-week stints in quarantine at a hotel or a remote former mining camp.\nThere are now two Australias. In Perth, offices, pubs and stadiums are crammed and normal as ever \u2014 the payoff for a closed-border approach that has made Western Australia an island within an island.

The confidence and pride <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2020,</span> when lockdowns and isolation brought outbreaks to heel, have been replaced by doubt, fatigue and a bitter battle over how much freedom or risk should be allowed in a Delta-defined future.\nSome states are trying desperately to hold on to what worked before, while New South Wales and Victoria, home to the country\u2019s biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, are being forced by Delta outbreaks to find a more nuanced path forward.

The campaign said late Tuesday that it was successful, and Mr. Fetterman was recovering well.\nIn a closely watched GOP primary, North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn is trailing State Sen.

Notably,<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 47 percent</span> of Michigan voters say Trump\u2019s China policies are bad for the state, vs. <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 26 percent</span> who say the opposite.\nCrucially, among Michigan union households, opposition climbs <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 55 percent</span>, and independents oppose the policies <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2 to</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.</span> Those groups likely include many of the blue-collar white and Obama-Trump voters Democrats must win back. <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Meanwhile, recent Quinnipiac polling found that in the industrial Midwest states, Trump\u2019s trade policies are underwater.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">What\u2019s more, Democrats have a good argument to make against Trump on trade: that his nationalism in practice has proved reckless, rooted in rage and whim; alienating to allies; and counterproductive, and that Democrats would restore sober, reality-based international cooperation to the center of our trade agenda.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Such an approach might be employed, say, against China\u2019s currency manipulation practices, as progressive economist Dean Baker points out.</span> \u201cA multilateral approach would likely mean getting the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States to negotiate a rise in the Chinese yuan of some targeted amount against the dollar,\u201d Baker told me.\nBy blasting Trump\u2019s agenda as \u201cerratic and impulsive\u201d and by vowing to rally allies against China and to \u201crestore our standing in the world,\u201d the Biden campaign is beginning to road-test such an argument.\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Biden takes hits from the left on trade\nAll this comes as Biden might himself be vulnerable on the issue.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Progressives such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have staked out aggressive positions against trade deals such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, both of which Biden supported.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Sanders recently ripped Biden for expressing skepticism that China is going to \u201ceat our lunch,\u201d arguing that Biden downplayed the Chinese threat to U.S. workers and vowing himself to offer a trade agenda that is in their interests.\n</span>A Biden campaign source tells me that Biden offered this in the spirit of trying to disarm Trump\u2019s demagoguery of the China threat, which is the groundwork for a case for a more rational, multilateral approach in place of threats and bluster.\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Biden has knocked Trump\u2019s trade war with China, and we should expect a more comprehensive substantive blueprint from him in coming months.\n</span>The differences between the primary candidates on China will be litigated in the primaries, of course. And so will Biden\u2019s position on NAFTA, which he has since defended, though some polls suggest it might not matter a great deal to Democratic voters.\nBut this debate is all to the good. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Whoever the Democratic nominee is, he or she may unite the party around an agenda built on multilateral cooperation against China, higher wage, labor and environmental standards in trade deals, and serious investments in displaced U.S. workers.</span> Such a debate will ultimately put Democrats in a stronger position against Trump in an area where he\u2019s weaker than all the bluster suggests.\nRead more:\nCatherine Rampell: Just a few of the reasons that Trump\u2019s Mexico tariffs are deeply stupid\nGreg Sargent: Trump\u2019s worldview is failing spectacularly.

The Chicago Teachers Union said late Tuesday night <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 73 percent</span> of members who voted favored pausing in-person instruction.\nBut Mayor Lori Lightfoot said reverting to online schooling was unacceptable and unnecessary, and her administration decided to call off class altogether \u2014 keeping the buildings open for emergency child care \u2014 rather than return to virtual instruction.\n\u201cNobody signs up for being a home-schooler at the last minute,\u201d Ms. Lightfoot said. \u201cWe can\u2019t forget about how disruptive that remote process is to individual parents who have to work, who can\u2019t afford the luxury of staying home.\u201d\nMs. Lightfoot, a Democrat, urged teachers to report to work and suggested they were considering an illegal work stoppage.\nAs highly contagious Omicron rears its head, so do debates that were considered settled. After a relatively calm fall, when school administrators, unions and families largely agreed that remote schooling was a nonstarter, the brinkmanship between the third-largest U.S. district and its union exposes just how quickly that political consensus can fall away.\nLike other school systems, Chicago has had to confront a shortage of tests, and a far from universal vaccination rate among students. There have been large numbers of staff members calling in sick, and widespread anxiety among just about everyone. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Other districts, including in Cleveland, Milwaukee and Atlanta, have also gone online temporarily, but without a public labor dispute.</span> The ongoing chaos has unnerved parents who are desperate for some kind of stability.\nCoronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Chicago to their highest rate since the pandemic began. But as in the rest of the country, vaccinated adults have had lower rates of hospitalization and death, while children of all ages \u2014 regardless of vaccination status \u2014 have overwhelmingly been spared severe outcomes.\nIn addition, data from Chicago and elsewhere shows that in-school transmission of the coronavirus has been limited, with a majority of teacher and student cases originating outside school buildings. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">More <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 90 percent</span> of Chicago Public Schools employees are fully vaccinated.\n</span>Still, members of the powerful Chicago Teachers Union have accused the school district of failing to adjust to Omicron, and the growing threat of breakthrough infections. During the holiday break, they had asked for either universal P.C.R. testing of students and staff or a two-week transition to remote learning.\n\u201cWe are between a rock and a hard place \u2014 the rock being the pandemic, the hard place being an intractable, incompetent mayor,\u201d Stacy Davis Gates, the union\u2019s vice president, said this week. She added, \u201cWe said a two-week pause so they could get themselves together, have the proper communication, put in the necessary mitigations.\u201d\nTracking the Coronavirus \u203a\n|United States \u203a||United StatesAvg. on Jan. 4||14-day change|\n|New cases||547,613||+254%|\n|New deaths||1,323||\u20133%|\n|World \u203a||WorldAvg. on Jan. 4||14-day change|\n|New cases||1,771,851||+156%|\n|New deaths||6,153||\u201311%|\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France drew fierce criticism on Wednesday after bluntly arguing that the government should make life miserable for the unvaccinated, as skyrocketing infection rates have put him under pressure to rein in the coronavirus pandemic ahead of a key presidential election.\n\u201cI really want to piss off the unvaccinated,\u201d Mr. Macron said in an interview with the newspaper Le Parisien. \u201cAnd so we are going to continue doing that, until the end.\u201d\nMr. Macron said that those who had refused coronavirus vaccines were part of a small minority. About three-quarters of France\u2019<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 67 million</span> people are fully vaccinated, but roughly five million French people have not received a single shot.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to put them in prison,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to vaccinate them by force.\u201d\nInstead, the government is pushing a bill through Parliament that will tighten the eligibility of France\u2019s health pass by no longer allowing people to obtain one with negative tests. The pass grants access to restaurants, cafes, museums and other public spaces.\nOnce the bill is approved, only proof of vaccination \u2014 or, in some cases, of recovery from Covid-19 \u2014 will be accepted, effectively barring the unvaccinated from large sections of French social life.\nFrance has seen record-breaking numbers of new confirmed cases almost every day over the past week \u2014 <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 270,000 for</span> Tuesday alone \u2014 and hospitalizations are steadily increasing. But unlike some of its European neighbors, France has balked at imposing restrictions like curfews or lockdowns to keep infection rates in check.\nMr. Macron has consistently made it clear that his government\u2019s strategy was to make life for unvaccinated French people uncomfortable. But his comments, which were published late Tuesday on the newspaper\u2019s website, marked the first time he stated so in such a crude way, even as the rapid surge of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is already fraying France\u2019s social contract on Covid.\nMr. Macron\u2019s comments quickly caused an uproar in Parliament, interrupting a session where lawmakers were debating the government\u2019s vaccination bill. Reaction from his political opposition was swift.\nChristian Jacob, the head of the right-wing Republicans party, told lawmakers that the comments were unbecoming of a French head of state. \u201cI cannot support a bill whose only goal is to piss off the French,\u201d he said.\nMarine Le Pen, the far-right leader and one of Mr. Macron\u2019s main opponents in the upcoming election, accused him of \u201cwaging war\u201d on the unvaccinated.\n\u201cEven if one doesn\u2019t share their choice, they have broken none of our country\u2019s laws,\u201d she told reporters in Parliament late Tuesday, saying Mr. Macron had made a political and moral mistake. \u201cHe is continuing his policy of division, of pitting the French against one another,\u201d she added.\nMr. Macron\u2019s comments come in a heated political climate \u2014 less than four months before the presidential election \u2014 and after he vowed in a recent interview that he had learned from mistakes made earlier in his term, when his one-liners were regularly criticized as dismissive and out of touch.\nThe president\u2019s opponents have maneuvered in Parliament to delay the passing of the vaccination bill, and his supporters have reported receiving death threats and insults because they are backing the legislation. One lawmaker\u2019s home garage was the target of arson and hostile graffiti last month.\nSt\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, a member of the European Parliament and close ally of Mr. Macron\u2019s, defended the president\u2019s comments, arguing on Twitter that it was the unvaccinated who were bothering the French by overburdening hospitals, exhausting health workers and \u201cforcing the rest of the population to endure restrictions.\u201d\n\u201cSo yes, we have to piss them off in return,\u201d he said.\nThe news that Novak Djokovic had received a medical exemption to play in the Australian Open tournament this month in Melbourne spurred a range of reactions in Australia, where some politicians and tennis officials called on him to explain himself.\nDjokovic, the world\u2019s No.<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1 male</span> tennis player and a prominent vaccination skeptic, announced on social media on Tuesday that he was \u201cheading Down Under with an exemption permission.\u201d\nThe tournament\u2019s organizers confirmed that he had been granted a medical exemption after a review process by two independent panels, a procedure that suggested he remained unvaccinated.\nReaction among the pro tennis elite was somewhat measured. After Alex de Minaur and James Duckworth, who are both from Australia, absorbed the news, Duckworth said at a news briefing at the ATP Cup in Sydney, \u201cIf he\u2019s fit the criteria, then, yeah, he should be able to come.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s very politically correct of you,\u201d de Minaur replied with a laugh. He added, \u201cI just think it\u2019s just very interesting; that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.\u201d\nOther Australians used social media to express their anger at the decision. The hashtag #DjokovicOut trended on Twitter on Wednesday. Commentators pointed out that spectators at the Australian Open must be vaccinated.\nStephen Parnis, a former vice president of the Australian Medical Association, tweeted: \u201cI don\u2019t care how good a tennis player he is. If he\u2019s refusing to get vaccinated, he shouldn\u2019t be allowed in. If this exemption is true, it sends an appalling message to millions seeking to reduce #COVID19Aus risk to themselves & others. #Vaccination shows respect, Novak.\u201d\nAnother Twitter user called it \u201ca slap in the face of millions of Australians.\u201d\nJamie Murray of Britain said on Tuesday after his ATP Cup doubles match: \u201cI think if it was me that wasn\u2019t vaccinated, I wouldn\u2019t be getting an exemption. But well done to him for getting clear to come to Australia and compete.\u201d\nDjokovic has long held nontraditional views of science and medicine \u2014 he once asserted that prayer and belief could purify toxic water \u2014 and he has had a complicated relationship with the pandemic. He has also said that vaccination is a private and personal decision that should not be mandated. When the Australian Open announced that vaccines would be required to gain entry into the country, Djokovic\u2019s father referred to the mandate as \u201cblackmail.\u201d\nJacinta Allan, acting premier of Victoria state, where the Australian Open will be held, called on Djokovic to explain his reasons for attending the tournament.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the government\u2019s expectation that when he does arrive, he explains to the Victorian community what\u2019s the circumstances, and can then explain some of these motives behind his actions and his intentions in playing here in Australia,\u201d she said on Wednesday at a news conference.\nCraig Tiley, the chief of Tennis Australia, which hosts the tournament, acknowledged that some people \u201cwill be upset about the fact that Novak has come in because of his statements of the past couple of years around vaccination,\u201d but he said that Djokovic had not been given any special favors.\nLeft unanswered was whether the tennis player could even enter the country for the tournament. The federal government says that if international travelers cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, they \u201cwill need to provide proof\u201d to airline staff.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia echoed that at a news conference on Wednesday, saying that if Djokovic arrived in Australia, he would have to provide \u201cacceptable proof that he cannot be vaccinated.\u201d\n\u201cIf that evidence is insufficient,\u201d Morrison said, \u201che won\u2019t be treated different to anyone else and he\u2019ll be on the next plane home.\u201d\nHong Kong announced a series of strict pandemic control measures on Wednesday, including suspending flights from the United States and seven other countries, as it scrambled to control an incipient Omicron outbreak.\nThe new measures will deepen the city\u2019s isolation from the outside world and mark a return to the tough restrictions from the early days of the pandemic. Hong Kong has largely brought the coronavirus under control, but the arrival of Omicron threatens to set off the city\u2019s fifth wave of the pandemic.\n\u201cGiven the very dire situation of the pandemic, we have to grasp this critical moment,\u201d Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, said at a news conference announcing the new rules.\nA day earlier, Mrs. Lam had said that no new social-distancing measures were expected. But the spread of Omicron, including the infection of a person with no clear connections to the city\u2019s first Omicron cluster, evidently forced a change.\n\u201cWe have to contain the pandemic to make sure there will not be a major outbreak in the community again,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are racing with Omicron, a highly transmissible variant.\u201d\nThe restrictions will make it even harder to enter Hong Kong, which already has one of the world\u2019s longest quarantines \u2014 up to three weeks. Under the new rules, flights will be temporarily banned from Australia, Britain, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines and United States for two weeks starting on Saturday. People who have recently been in those countries will also be barred from traveling by other routes.\nLarge public events will be canceled, and several public venues \u2014 including bars, gyms and karaoke parlors \u2014 will be closed.

It has been detected in at <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 128 countries</span>, according to the W.H.O., and is fueling record-high case numbers in many parts of the world.\nConcerns over the variant in France arose after researchers found that it <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">contained 46 mutations</span> that differed from the original version of the coronavirus. Omicron also has a high number of mutations, which researchers believe made it far more transmissible.\nAccording to a research paper that was published on a preprint server in late December, but that has not been peer-reviewed, the B.1.640.2 variant was first detected in southeastern France in a vaccinated person who had recently traveled from Cameroon. Researchers found a total <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 12 cases</span> in the area and named the variant \u201cI.H.U.,\u201d after the research institute in Marseille that helped identify it.\n\u201cIt is too early to speculate on virological, epidemiological or clinical features of this I.H.U. variant based on <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">these 12 cases</span>,\u201d researchers wrote.\nNumerous coronavirus variants have emerged over the past two years, and the reasons that some spread widely while others do not are complex. For now, several independent researchers say there is little reason to be concerned about the I.H.U. variant.\nTom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College in London, tweeted this week that, so far, \u201cthis virus has had a decent chance to cause trouble but never really materialised.\u201d\nLots of chat about B.1.640.2 in the last few days - just a few points to keep in mind:\u2014 Tom Peacock (@PeacockFlu) <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">January 3,</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2022\n</span>- B.1.640.2 actually predates Omicron\n- in all that time there are exactly...<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20 sequences</span> (compared to the >120k Omis in less time)\nDef not one worth worrying about too much at the mo...\nAfter going virtual last year, CES, a mega-conference in Las Vegas that\u2019s the traditional launchpad for many of the tech industry\u2019s latest gadgets, is trying to make a comeback. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The trade show kicks off on Wednesday, with an <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">estimated 2,200 exhibitors</span> set to show up in person.\n</span>But with the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus surging, scores of major tech companies are still presenting mostly virtually.\nIt\u2019s a sign that decisions to hold big in-person events at this phase of the pandemic remain far from clear-cut, the DealBook newsletter reports. Yet the organizers of CES \u2014 like those of the Winter Olympics and the Australian Open, which are set to begin soon \u2014 have decided it\u2019s time to gather in person again.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Canceling the show would \u201churt thousands of smaller companies, entrepreneurs and innovators\u201d who depend on the show to introduce their products, Gary Shapiro, the chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, the trade group that organizes CES, wrote in an opinion column in The Las Vegas Review-Journal.</span> (The conference is also important for Las Vegas, which reaped an <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">estimated $291 million</span> from spending tied to it <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020.</span>) Mr. Shapiro noted that the conference had embraced pandemic protections like requiring attendees to be fully vaccinated and masked while on the show floor, and that testing was readily available.\nBut many large companies have chosen to attend remotely, including Amazon, AMD, AT&T, General Motors, Google, Intel, Lenovo, Meta, Nvidia, Pinterest, T-Mobile and Twitter. That will leave \u201cbig gaps on the show floor,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. And CES will end a day early, in what the organizers said was a concession to safety.\nOther big events are delaying their return to in-person gatherings. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Organizers of the Grammys are reportedly considering delaying this month\u2019s music awards show, while the World Economic Forum postponed its annual confab in Davos, Switzerland, which was set to take place this month.\n</span>So is it safe to hold live in-person events again? Omicron cases appear to be less severe than cases from previous variants, and vaccines and new treatments are becoming available. More governments are also edging toward managing, not containing, the coronavirus, and are increasingly reluctant to reimpose restrictions. That could mean that a return to regular mass gatherings in some places may not be far-off.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain on Tuesday said that despite the record surge in coronavirus cases, the limited restrictions currently in place in England were the right approach and would be maintained.\n\u201cWe have a chance to ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country once again,\u201d Mr. Johnson said at an evening news conference, adding, \u201cWe can keep our schools and businesses open, and we can find a way to live with this virus.\u201d\nThe prime minister said he would urge the cabinet to carry on with the current coronavirus contingency measures, called \u201cPlan B,\u201d which were introduced in early December as the Omicron wave took hold. They include masking mandates, guidance to work from home and the use of vaccine passports, but they fall short of the stricter lockdown measures some opposition lawmakers and scientists had called for.\n\u201cI do think the balance of measures that we have is the right one,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. He said he believed there was a \u201cgood chance\u201d of getting through the wave without further restrictions.\nAs Mr. Johnson\u2019s government has pushed for the Britain to remain open in recent weeks, a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant has added to the pressure to shut down. On Tuesday, <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some 218,000 new</span> coronavirus cases were reported, and hospitalizations have continued to rise.\nAbsences at hospitals across England have left a number of facilities critically short of staff, field hospitals have been set up to deal with an overflow of patients, and public transportation has been hit with shutdowns as workers have called in sick.\nMr. Johnson acknowledged that the weeks ahead would be challenging. But he pointed to support being given to key industries and said he believed the staff shortages would be far less disruptive than a lockdown. He said the government had <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">identified 100,000 critical</span> workers who would be offered daily virus tests to help keep essential services open.\nSchools in England reopened on Tuesday with new measures, including extended masking requirements and testing. Recently retired teachers were being asked to return to cover absences. And as England\u2019s National Health Service moved to a \u201cwar footing,\u201d the government was working to identify hospitals most likely to need military support.\nDespite the rise in cases, there were some glimmers of good news.\nEngland\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said on Tuesday that new data showed that a booster shot gave a person <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 88 percent</span> protection against hospitalization, and that protection was likely to be even greater when it came to mortality.\nEarlier in the day, Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, said that he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that coronavirus infection rates in London in the key 18-to-50 age group that has been driving the Omicron outbreak \u201cmay possibly have plateaued.\u201d\nProfessor Ferguson told the BBC that it was too early to say whether new infections were going down, but the growth in some areas had slowed. He cautioned, however, that it could be weeks before the full effect of social mixing over Christmas was known. Holiday socializing may prove especially risky for older populations, he said.\n\u201cHospitalizations are still generally going up across the country, and we may see high levels for some weeks,\u201d Professor Ferguson said, adding that the numbers were still far below levels seen during a peak last year.\nThe International Polar Foundation confirmed on Tuesday <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 11 workers</span> at a research station in Antarctica had tested positive for the coronavirus last month despite testing and quarantine requirements for new arrivals.\nAll of the infected workers \u2014 eight of whom are still in Antarctica, and three of whom left on a scheduled Dec.<span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 23 flight</span> \u2014 were vaccinated and have recovered, according to the foundation, which is based in Belgium and operates that country\u2019s Princess Elisabeth Station Antarctica research facility.

The Chicago Teachers Union said late Tuesday night <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 73 percent</span> of members who voted favored pausing in-person instruction.\nBut Mayor Lori Lightfoot said reverting to online schooling was unacceptable and unnecessary, and her administration decided to call off class altogether \u2014 keeping the buildings open for emergency child care \u2014 rather than return to virtual instruction.\n\u201cNobody signs up for being a home-schooler at the last minute,\u201d Ms. Lightfoot said. \u201cWe can\u2019t forget about how disruptive that remote process is to individual parents who have to work, who can\u2019t afford the luxury of staying home.\u201d\nMs. Lightfoot, a Democrat, urged teachers to report to work and suggested they were considering an illegal work stoppage.\nAs highly contagious Omicron rears its head, so do debates that were considered settled. After a relatively calm fall, when school administrators, unions and families largely agreed that remote schooling was a nonstarter, the brinkmanship between the third-largest U.S. district and its union exposes just how quickly that political consensus can fall away.\nLike other school systems, Chicago has had to confront a shortage of tests, and a far from universal vaccination rate among students. There have been large numbers of staff members calling in sick, and widespread anxiety among just about everyone. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Other districts, including in Cleveland, Milwaukee and Atlanta, have also gone online temporarily, but without a public labor dispute.</span> The ongoing chaos has unnerved parents who are desperate for some kind of stability.\nCoronavirus cases have skyrocketed in Chicago to their highest rate since the pandemic began. But as in the rest of the country, vaccinated adults have had lower rates of hospitalization and death, while children of all ages \u2014 regardless of vaccination status \u2014 have overwhelmingly been spared severe outcomes.\nIn addition, data from Chicago and elsewhere shows that in-school transmission of the coronavirus has been limited, with a majority of teacher and student cases originating outside school buildings. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">More <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 90 percent</span> of Chicago Public Schools employees are fully vaccinated.\n</span>Still, members of the powerful Chicago Teachers Union have accused the school district of failing to adjust to Omicron, and the growing threat of breakthrough infections. During the holiday break, they had asked for either universal P.C.R. testing of students and staff or a two-week transition to remote learning.\n\u201cWe are between a rock and a hard place \u2014 the rock being the pandemic, the hard place being an intractable, incompetent mayor,\u201d Stacy Davis Gates, the union\u2019s vice president, said this week. She added, \u201cWe said a two-week pause so they could get themselves together, have the proper communication, put in the necessary mitigations.\u201d\nTracking the Coronavirus \u203a\n|United States \u203a||United StatesAvg. on Jan. 4||14-day change|\n|New cases||547,613||+254%|\n|New deaths||1,323||\u20133%|\n|World \u203a||WorldAvg. on Jan. 4||14-day change|\n|New cases||1,771,851||+156%|\n|New deaths||6,153||\u201311%|\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France drew fierce criticism on Wednesday after bluntly arguing that the government should make life miserable for the unvaccinated, as skyrocketing infection rates have put him under pressure to rein in the coronavirus pandemic ahead of a key presidential election.\n\u201cI really want to piss off the unvaccinated,\u201d Mr. Macron said in an interview with the newspaper Le Parisien. \u201cAnd so we are going to continue doing that, until the end.\u201d\nMr. Macron said that those who had refused coronavirus vaccines were part of a small minority. About three-quarters of France\u2019<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 67 million</span> people are fully vaccinated, but roughly five million French people have not received a single shot.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to put them in prison,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to vaccinate them by force.\u201d\nInstead, the government is pushing a bill through Parliament that will tighten the eligibility of France\u2019s health pass by no longer allowing people to obtain one with negative tests. The pass grants access to restaurants, cafes, museums and other public spaces.\nOnce the bill is approved, only proof of vaccination \u2014 or, in some cases, of recovery from Covid-19 \u2014 will be accepted, effectively barring the unvaccinated from large sections of French social life.\nFrance has seen record-breaking numbers of new confirmed cases almost every day over the past week \u2014 <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 270,000 for</span> Tuesday alone \u2014 and hospitalizations are steadily increasing. But unlike some of its European neighbors, France has balked at imposing restrictions like curfews or lockdowns to keep infection rates in check.\nMr. Macron has consistently made it clear that his government\u2019s strategy was to make life for unvaccinated French people uncomfortable. But his comments, which were published late Tuesday on the newspaper\u2019s website, marked the first time he stated so in such a crude way, even as the rapid surge of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is already fraying France\u2019s social contract on Covid.\nMr. Macron\u2019s comments quickly caused an uproar in Parliament, interrupting a session where lawmakers were debating the government\u2019s vaccination bill. Reaction from his political opposition was swift.\nChristian Jacob, the head of the right-wing Republicans party, told lawmakers that the comments were unbecoming of a French head of state. \u201cI cannot support a bill whose only goal is to piss off the French,\u201d he said.\nMarine Le Pen, the far-right leader and one of Mr. Macron\u2019s main opponents in the upcoming election, accused him of \u201cwaging war\u201d on the unvaccinated.\n\u201cEven if one doesn\u2019t share their choice, they have broken none of our country\u2019s laws,\u201d she told reporters in Parliament late Tuesday, saying Mr. Macron had made a political and moral mistake. \u201cHe is continuing his policy of division, of pitting the French against one another,\u201d she added.\nMr. Macron\u2019s comments come in a heated political climate \u2014 less than four months before the presidential election \u2014 and after he vowed in a recent interview that he had learned from mistakes made earlier in his term, when his one-liners were regularly criticized as dismissive and out of touch.\nThe president\u2019s opponents have maneuvered in Parliament to delay the passing of the vaccination bill, and his supporters have reported receiving death threats and insults because they are backing the legislation. One lawmaker\u2019s home garage was the target of arson and hostile graffiti last month.\nSt\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, a member of the European Parliament and close ally of Mr. Macron\u2019s, defended the president\u2019s comments, arguing on Twitter that it was the unvaccinated who were bothering the French by overburdening hospitals, exhausting health workers and \u201cforcing the rest of the population to endure restrictions.\u201d\n\u201cSo yes, we have to piss them off in return,\u201d he said.\nThe news that Novak Djokovic had received a medical exemption to play in the Australian Open tournament this month in Melbourne spurred a range of reactions in Australia, where some politicians and tennis officials called on him to explain himself.\nDjokovic, the world\u2019s No.<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1 male</span> tennis player and a prominent vaccination skeptic, announced on social media on Tuesday that he was \u201cheading Down Under with an exemption permission.\u201d\nThe tournament\u2019s organizers confirmed that he had been granted a medical exemption after a review process by two independent panels, a procedure that suggested he remained unvaccinated.\nReaction among the pro tennis elite was somewhat measured. After Alex de Minaur and James Duckworth, who are both from Australia, absorbed the news, Duckworth said at a news briefing at the ATP Cup in Sydney, \u201cIf he\u2019s fit the criteria, then, yeah, he should be able to come.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s very politically correct of you,\u201d de Minaur replied with a laugh. He added, \u201cI just think it\u2019s just very interesting; that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.\u201d\nOther Australians used social media to express their anger at the decision. The hashtag #DjokovicOut trended on Twitter on Wednesday. Commentators pointed out that spectators at the Australian Open must be vaccinated.\nStephen Parnis, a former vice president of the Australian Medical Association, tweeted: \u201cI don\u2019t care how good a tennis player he is. If he\u2019s refusing to get vaccinated, he shouldn\u2019t be allowed in. If this exemption is true, it sends an appalling message to millions seeking to reduce #COVID19Aus risk to themselves & others. #Vaccination shows respect, Novak.\u201d\nAnother Twitter user called it \u201ca slap in the face of millions of Australians.\u201d\nJamie Murray of Britain said on Tuesday after his ATP Cup doubles match: \u201cI think if it was me that wasn\u2019t vaccinated, I wouldn\u2019t be getting an exemption. But well done to him for getting clear to come to Australia and compete.\u201d\nDjokovic has long held nontraditional views of science and medicine \u2014 he once asserted that prayer and belief could purify toxic water \u2014 and he has had a complicated relationship with the pandemic. He has also said that vaccination is a private and personal decision that should not be mandated. When the Australian Open announced that vaccines would be required to gain entry into the country, Djokovic\u2019s father referred to the mandate as \u201cblackmail.\u201d\nJacinta Allan, acting premier of Victoria state, where the Australian Open will be held, called on Djokovic to explain his reasons for attending the tournament.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the government\u2019s expectation that when he does arrive, he explains to the Victorian community what\u2019s the circumstances, and can then explain some of these motives behind his actions and his intentions in playing here in Australia,\u201d she said on Wednesday at a news conference.\nCraig Tiley, the chief of Tennis Australia, which hosts the tournament, acknowledged that some people \u201cwill be upset about the fact that Novak has come in because of his statements of the past couple of years around vaccination,\u201d but he said that Djokovic had not been given any special favors.\nLeft unanswered was whether the tennis player could even enter the country for the tournament. The federal government says that if international travelers cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, they \u201cwill need to provide proof\u201d to airline staff.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia echoed that at a news conference on Wednesday, saying that if Djokovic arrived in Australia, he would have to provide \u201cacceptable proof that he cannot be vaccinated.\u201d\n\u201cIf that evidence is insufficient,\u201d Morrison said, \u201che won\u2019t be treated different to anyone else and he\u2019ll be on the next plane home.\u201d\nHong Kong announced a series of strict pandemic control measures on Wednesday, including suspending flights from the United States and seven other countries, as it scrambled to control an incipient Omicron outbreak.\nThe new measures will deepen the city\u2019s isolation from the outside world and mark a return to the tough restrictions from the early days of the pandemic. Hong Kong has largely brought the coronavirus under control, but the arrival of Omicron threatens to set off the city\u2019s fifth wave of the pandemic.\n\u201cGiven the very dire situation of the pandemic, we have to grasp this critical moment,\u201d Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, said at a news conference announcing the new rules.\nA day earlier, Mrs. Lam had said that no new social-distancing measures were expected. But the spread of Omicron, including the infection of a person with no clear connections to the city\u2019s first Omicron cluster, evidently forced a change.\n\u201cWe have to contain the pandemic to make sure there will not be a major outbreak in the community again,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are racing with Omicron, a highly transmissible variant.\u201d\nThe restrictions will make it even harder to enter Hong Kong, which already has one of the world\u2019s longest quarantines \u2014 up to three weeks. Under the new rules, flights will be temporarily banned from Australia, Britain, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines and United States for two weeks starting on Saturday. People who have recently been in those countries will also be barred from traveling by other routes.\nLarge public events will be canceled, and several public venues \u2014 including bars, gyms and karaoke parlors \u2014 will be closed. Visits to hospitals and nursing homes will also be banned for two weeks. Dining in restaurants will be banned <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 6 p</span>.m. But the government decided not to stop in-person teaching or require government officials to work from home.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Hong Kong has had a growing number of imported cases of the Omicron variant, <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 133 as</span> of Tuesday.\n</span>\u201cIf this continues, there will be tremendous strain on our quarantine and health care facilities,\u201d said Dr. Ronald Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s director of health.\nThe Omicron outbreak in the city has been traced to a Cathay Pacific flight attendant who ignored quarantine requirements after returning from the United States. He dined at the Moon Palace restaurant in the upscale Fashion Walk shopping mall on Dec.<span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span> infecting his father and at least one other person.\nMrs. Lam said the measures were most likely \u201cthe most decisive, rapid, targeted and comprehensive for the past two years so that we can cut the transmission chains as soon as possible.\u201d\nThe restrictions came as Hong Kong health authorities on Wednesday ordered a Royal Caribbean cruise ship to return to port early as officials searched for the contacts of a Covid-19 patient.\nNine people who boarded the ship, the Spectrum of the Seas, on Jan.<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2 had</span> come into contact with the patient, who did not board the ship, the government said in a statement. The people were told to quarantine as soon as they were identified as contacts, though they preliminarily tested negative.\nJohn Yoon contributed reporting.\nA woman in Georgia who fraudulently obtained more <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $6 million</span> in Covid relief money was sentenced to more than three years in prison on Tuesday, the Justice Department said.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The case is the latest example of Americans misusing the Paycheck Protection Program, a part of <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $2.2 billion</span> Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act that Congress passed in <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2020.</span>\n</span>In the latest case, the Georgia woman, Hunter VanPelt, pleaded guilty to bank fraud in August after submitting six loan applications for a total of more <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $7.9 million</span> on behalf of companies that she owned or controlled, prosecutors said.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Prosecutors say that Ms. VanPelt,<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 49,</span> whose legal name was Ellen Corkrum <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">until 2016,</span> lied about payroll expenses and the number of people her companies employed.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">She also submitted fraudulent tax records, payroll reports and bank statements, they said.</span> Her lawyer could not be immediately contacted for comment overnight.\nThe Justice Department said on Tuesday that it had recovered <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $2.1 million</span> of <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $6 million</span> that Ms. VanPelt received through the program. It said a bank had also seized and returned an <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">additional $1.6 million</span>.\nThe giant loan program, which ran intermittently from <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 2020 to</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 2021,</span> relied on banks and other lenders. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">To speed the lending process, the federal government waived much of the vetting that lenders traditionally do on business loans.\n</span>The program has been highly susceptible to fraud. Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin estimated in August that <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $76 billion</span> of <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its $800 billion</span> in loans might have been taken improperly. (They also made a more conservative estimate <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $38 billion</span>.)\nThe Justice Department said on Tuesday that it had prosecuted more <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 150 defendants</span> so far and seized more <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $75 million</span> in cash derived from fraudulent loans through the program, along with properties and luxury items.\nLast month, a former New York Jets wide receiver, Joshua J. Bellamy, was sentenced <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 37 months</span> in prison after he fraudulently obtained more <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $1.2 million</span> through the Paycheck Protection Program for a company that he owned.\nProsecutors said that Mr. Bellamy had spent more <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $100,000 of</span> the funds on luxury goods from Dior, Gucci and other brands. He pleaded guilty in June to conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\nThe World Health Organization says that it is monitoring a coronavirus variant detected in a small number of patients in France, but that, for now, there is little reason to worry about its spread.\nThe B.1.640.2 variant was first identified in October and uploaded to Gisaid, a database for disease variants, on Nov.<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4.</span> Only <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 20 samples</span> have been sequenced so far, experts said this week, and only one since early December.\nAbdi Mahmud, a Covid incident manager with the W.H.O., told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday that the variant had been on the agency\u2019s radar since November, but added that it did not appear to have spread widely over the past two months.\n\u201cThat virus has had a lot of chances to pick up,\u201d he said.\nBy contrast, the Omicron variant, which was first uploaded to Gisaid on Nov.<span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 23,</span> has more <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 120,000 sequences</span> in the database. (The vast majority of Omicron cases have not been sequenced.) It has been detected in at <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 128 countries</span>, according to the W.H.O., and is fueling record-high case numbers in many parts of the world.\nConcerns over the variant in France arose after researchers found that it <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">contained 46 mutations</span> that differed from the original version of the coronavirus. Omicron also has a high number of mutations, which researchers believe made it far more transmissible.\nAccording to a research paper that was published on a preprint server in late December, but that has not been peer-reviewed, the B.1.640.2 variant was first detected in southeastern France in a vaccinated person who had recently traveled from Cameroon. Researchers found a total <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 12 cases</span> in the area and named the variant \u201cI.H.U.,\u201d after the research institute in Marseille that helped identify it.\n\u201cIt is too early to speculate on virological, epidemiological or clinical features of this I.H.U. variant based on <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">these 12 cases</span>,\u201d researchers wrote.\nNumerous coronavirus variants have emerged over the past two years, and the reasons that some spread widely while others do not are complex. For now, several independent researchers say there is little reason to be concerned about the I.H.U. variant.\nTom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College in London, tweeted this week that, so far, \u201cthis virus has had a decent chance to cause trouble but never really materialised.\u201d\nLots of chat about B.1.640.2 in the last few days - just a few points to keep in mind:\u2014 Tom Peacock (@PeacockFlu) <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">January 3,</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2022\n</span>- B.1.640.2 actually predates Omicron\n- in all that time there are exactly...<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20 sequences</span> (compared to the >120k Omis in less time)\nDef not one worth worrying about too much at the mo...\nAfter going virtual last year, CES, a mega-conference in Las Vegas that\u2019s the traditional launchpad for many of the tech industry\u2019s latest gadgets, is trying to make a comeback. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The trade show kicks off on Wednesday, with an <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">estimated 2,200 exhibitors</span> set to show up in person.\n</span>But with the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus surging, scores of major tech companies are still presenting mostly virtually.\nIt\u2019s a sign that decisions to hold big in-person events at this phase of the pandemic remain far from clear-cut, the DealBook newsletter reports. Yet the organizers of CES \u2014 like those of the Winter Olympics and the Australian Open, which are set to begin soon \u2014 have decided it\u2019s time to gather in person again.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Canceling the show would \u201churt thousands of smaller companies, entrepreneurs and innovators\u201d who depend on the show to introduce their products, Gary Shapiro, the chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, the trade group that organizes CES, wrote in an opinion column in The Las Vegas Review-Journal.</span> (The conference is also important for Las Vegas, which reaped an <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">estimated $291 million</span> from spending tied to it <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020.</span>) Mr. Shapiro noted that the conference had embraced pandemic protections like requiring attendees to be fully vaccinated and masked while on the show floor, and that testing was readily available.\nBut many large companies have chosen to attend remotely, including Amazon, AMD, AT&T, General Motors, Google, Intel, Lenovo, Meta, Nvidia, Pinterest, T-Mobile and Twitter. That will leave \u201cbig gaps on the show floor,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. And CES will end a day early, in what the organizers said was a concession to safety.\nOther big events are delaying their return to in-person gatherings. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Organizers of the Grammys are reportedly considering delaying this month\u2019s music awards show, while the World Economic Forum postponed its annual confab in Davos, Switzerland, which was set to take place this month.\n</span>So is it safe to hold live in-person events again? Omicron cases appear to be less severe than cases from previous variants, and vaccines and new treatments are becoming available. More governments are also edging toward managing, not containing, the coronavirus, and are increasingly reluctant to reimpose restrictions. That could mean that a return to regular mass gatherings in some places may not be far-off.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain on Tuesday said that despite the record surge in coronavirus cases, the limited restrictions currently in place in England were the right approach and would be maintained.\n\u201cWe have a chance to ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country once again,\u201d Mr. Johnson said at an evening news conference, adding, \u201cWe can keep our schools and businesses open, and we can find a way to live with this virus.\u201d\nThe prime minister said he would urge the cabinet to carry on with the current coronavirus contingency measures, called \u201cPlan B,\u201d which were introduced in early December as the Omicron wave took hold. They include masking mandates, guidance to work from home and the use of vaccine passports, but they fall short of the stricter lockdown measures some opposition lawmakers and scientists had called for.\n\u201cI do think the balance of measures that we have is the right one,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. He said he believed there was a \u201cgood chance\u201d of getting through the wave without further restrictions.\nAs Mr. Johnson\u2019s government has pushed for the Britain to remain open in recent weeks, a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant has added to the pressure to shut down. On Tuesday, <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some 218,000 new</span> coronavirus cases were reported, and hospitalizations have continued to rise.\nAbsences at hospitals across England have left a number of facilities critically short of staff, field hospitals have been set up to deal with an overflow of patients, and public transportation has been hit with shutdowns as workers have called in sick.\nMr. Johnson acknowledged that the weeks ahead would be challenging. But he pointed to support being given to key industries and said he believed the staff shortages would be far less disruptive than a lockdown. He said the government had <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">identified 100,000 critical</span> workers who would be offered daily virus tests to help keep essential services open.\nSchools in England reopened on Tuesday with new measures, including extended masking requirements and testing. Recently retired teachers were being asked to return to cover absences. And as England\u2019s National Health Service moved to a \u201cwar footing,\u201d the government was working to identify hospitals most likely to need military support.\nDespite the rise in cases, there were some glimmers of good news.\nEngland\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said on Tuesday that new data showed that a booster shot gave a person <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 88 percent</span> protection against hospitalization, and that protection was likely to be even greater when it came to mortality.\nEarlier in the day, Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, said that he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that coronavirus infection rates in London in the key 18-to-50 age group that has been driving the Omicron outbreak \u201cmay possibly have plateaued.\u201d\nProfessor Ferguson told the BBC that it was too early to say whether new infections were going down, but the growth in some areas had slowed. He cautioned, however, that it could be weeks before the full effect of social mixing over Christmas was known. Holiday socializing may prove especially risky for older populations, he said.\n\u201cHospitalizations are still generally going up across the country, and we may see high levels for some weeks,\u201d Professor Ferguson said, adding that the numbers were still far below levels seen during a peak last year.\nThe International Polar Foundation confirmed on Tuesday <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 11 workers</span> at a research station in Antarctica had tested positive for the coronavirus last month despite testing and quarantine requirements for new arrivals.\nAll of the infected workers \u2014 eight of whom are still in Antarctica, and three of whom left on a scheduled Dec.<span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 23 flight</span> \u2014 were vaccinated and have recovered, according to the foundation, which is based in Belgium and operates that country\u2019s Princess Elisabeth Station Antarctica research facility.

In addition, four scientists are conducting \u201cremote field work,\u201d according to the foundation.\nSome news outlets have reported <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 16 people</span> tested positive, a number the foundation said was inaccurate.

In addition, a new team of scientists will arrive at the station on Jan.<span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 12 as</span> planned. They were also informed of the outbreak and given the opportunity to cancel, which they refused.\u201d\nWorkers at the station are all vaccinated, but only one has received a booster shot.

That\u2019s bad for anyone who cares about an office with a mix of races, genders and points of view.\n\u201cWhat most people mean by culture fit is hiring people they\u2019d like to have a beer with,\u201d says Patty McCord, a human-resources consultant and former chief talent officer at Netflix. \u201cYou end up with this big, homogenous culture where everybody looks alike, everybody thinks alike, and everybody likes drinking beer <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 3 o</span>\u2019clock in the afternoon with the bros,\u201d she says.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">An alluring culture is a coveted prize in today\u2019s tight labor market, surging to first from fifth place in the last five years as the most important factor in recruiting top talent, according to <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2018 Korn</span> Ferry survey <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1,100 hiring</span> managers.</span> But there\u2019s a difference between cultural frills like office ping pong and craft beer, and deeper ones that mean more. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">To employees, it means loving a job for more than just the paycheck.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">And to employers, it means employees will keep working hard even when no one is watching.\n</span>Making a good match can be difficult. In a pattern researchers call looking-glass merit, hirers tend to look for traits in candidates that make them feel good about themselves. These may be more nuanced than race or gender. A manager who got bad grades as a college freshman is likely to warm to an applicant who also got off to a rough start, research shows. Or a hirer who attended a low-prestige school may favor applicants who did the same.\n\u201cWhat most interviewers are looking for and acting on is more of an intuitive sense of, \u2018Would I get along with this person?\u2019 and that often isn\u2019t very reliable,\u201d says Kirsta Anderson, global head of culture transformation in London for Korn Ferry.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Employees err in taking a job because it offers office ping pong, free lunches or heated toilet seats.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Ms. McCord recently met an HR executive who claimed to keep employees happy by serving up the latest craft beers.</span> \u201cWell, that sounds like a fun vacation. I\u2019d probably go to that resort. But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re here to do,\u201d says Ms. McCord, author of \u201cPowerful,\u201d a book on building workplace cultures.\nShare Your Thoughts\nHow can bosses make sure they\u2019re hiring for meaningful shared values rather than superficial sameness? Join the conversation below.\nHiring managers need to go deeper and figure out whether applicants are in sync with more fundamental elements of their culture, Ms. Anderson says. Are they excited about how the company innovates, serves customers or makes a social impact? Will they mesh with the way individuals and teams at the company work, by collaborating or competing? <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">And will they naturally make decisions the way the employer wants\u2014individually or as a group, embracing or avoiding risk?\n</span>It isn\u2019t easy to suss out those traits in an interview. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Jeanne Leasure, a human-resources executive, recalls interviewing applicants for a job that gave employees a lot of autonomy.</span> She was looking for recruits who were self-starters, but wound up hiring one who turned out to be a lovable slacker. \u201cWe hit it off, we had similar personalities,\u201d and the applicant gave convincing answers when she asked him about past accomplishments, she says. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">But on the job, he didn\u2019t have as much drive as she\u2019d hoped, says Ms. Leasure, who was recently named senior vice president, people, at SpotX, an ad-tech company based in Broomfield, Colo.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">She has begun asking more probing questions, such as, \u201cWhat was your work ethic like as a teenager?\u201d\nFingerpaint Marketing is a flat organization with no lofty job titles, and its teams must work smoothly together on tight deadlines.</span> When Ed Mitzen, founder of the Saratoga Springs, N.Y., agency, interviews candidates, he explores whether they\u2019ll be kind to everyone regardless of status, and pleasant to work with. If teammates enjoy working with them, he reasons the team will get more done and do better work.\nHe screens out big egos partly by asking drivers for his company\u2019s car service how candidates treated them en route to and from the interview. \u201cIf they\u2019re a jerk to the car-service guy, that\u2019s a warning sign,\u201d Mr. Mitzen says. He once rejected an applicant partly because he put on airs with the driver and expected him to open the door for him.\n\u201cReally? <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">You\u2019re applying for <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $150,000</span>-a-year job,\u201d Mr. Mitzen says.</span> \u201cYou\u2019re not applying to be ambassador to France.

That\u2019s bad for anyone who cares about an office with a mix of races, genders and points of view.\n\u201cWhat most people mean by culture fit is hiring people they\u2019d like to have a beer with,\u201d says Patty McCord, a human-resources consultant and former chief talent officer at Netflix. \u201cYou end up with this big, homogenous culture where everybody looks alike, everybody thinks alike, and everybody likes drinking beer <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 3 o</span>\u2019clock in the afternoon with the bros,\u201d she says.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">An alluring culture is a coveted prize in today\u2019s tight labor market, surging to first from fifth place in the last five years as the most important factor in recruiting top talent, according to <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2018 Korn</span> Ferry survey <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 1,100 hiring</span> managers.</span> But there\u2019s a difference between cultural frills like office ping pong and craft beer, and deeper ones that mean more. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">To employees, it means loving a job for more than just the paycheck.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">And to employers, it means employees will keep working hard even when no one is watching.\n</span>Making a good match can be difficult. In a pattern researchers call looking-glass merit, hirers tend to look for traits in candidates that make them feel good about themselves. These may be more nuanced than race or gender. A manager who got bad grades as a college freshman is likely to warm to an applicant who also got off to a rough start, research shows. Or a hirer who attended a low-prestige school may favor applicants who did the same.\n\u201cWhat most interviewers are looking for and acting on is more of an intuitive sense of, \u2018Would I get along with this person?\u2019 and that often isn\u2019t very reliable,\u201d says Kirsta Anderson, global head of culture transformation in London for Korn Ferry.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Employees err in taking a job because it offers office ping pong, free lunches or heated toilet seats.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Ms. McCord recently met an HR executive who claimed to keep employees happy by serving up the latest craft beers.</span> \u201cWell, that sounds like a fun vacation. I\u2019d probably go to that resort. But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re here to do,\u201d says Ms. McCord, author of \u201cPowerful,\u201d a book on building workplace cultures.\nShare Your Thoughts\nHow can bosses make sure they\u2019re hiring for meaningful shared values rather than superficial sameness? Join the conversation below.\nHiring managers need to go deeper and figure out whether applicants are in sync with more fundamental elements of their culture, Ms. Anderson says. Are they excited about how the company innovates, serves customers or makes a social impact? Will they mesh with the way individuals and teams at the company work, by collaborating or competing? <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">And will they naturally make decisions the way the employer wants\u2014individually or as a group, embracing or avoiding risk?\n</span>It isn\u2019t easy to suss out those traits in an interview. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Jeanne Leasure, a human-resources executive, recalls interviewing applicants for a job that gave employees a lot of autonomy.</span> She was looking for recruits who were self-starters, but wound up hiring one who turned out to be a lovable slacker. \u201cWe hit it off, we had similar personalities,\u201d and the applicant gave convincing answers when she asked him about past accomplishments, she says. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">But on the job, he didn\u2019t have as much drive as she\u2019d hoped, says Ms. Leasure, who was recently named senior vice president, people, at SpotX, an ad-tech company based in Broomfield, Colo.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">She has begun asking more probing questions, such as, \u201cWhat was your work ethic like as a teenager?\u201d\nFingerpaint Marketing is a flat organization with no lofty job titles, and its teams must work smoothly together on tight deadlines.</span> When Ed Mitzen, founder of the Saratoga Springs, N.Y., agency, interviews candidates, he explores whether they\u2019ll be kind to everyone regardless of status, and pleasant to work with. If teammates enjoy working with them, he reasons the team will get more done and do better work.\nHe screens out big egos partly by asking drivers for his company\u2019s car service how candidates treated them en route to and from the interview. \u201cIf they\u2019re a jerk to the car-service guy, that\u2019s a warning sign,\u201d Mr. Mitzen says. He once rejected an applicant partly because he put on airs with the driver and expected him to open the door for him.\n\u201cReally? <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">You\u2019re applying for <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $150,000</span>-a-year job,\u201d Mr. Mitzen says.</span> \u201cYou\u2019re not applying to be ambassador to France.
