Putin\u2019s decision this week to expand the size of his military offered further evidence for a conviction taking hold in both Russia and Ukraine: The two sides are settling in for the long haul in a war that could last another year, or longer.\nMr. Putin, secure in his power and having silenced dissent, appears to have little incentive to stop the war, which he has now waged for more than six months without declaring a nationwide draft that could have provoked domestic discontent.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, warning his nation on Friday that the coming winter would be \u201cthe most difficult in our history,\u201d is being bolstered by a largely unified West and a defiant populace in his insistence that there will be no compromise with an invading army.\nThe conflict has settled into a war of attrition, with little movement along the front line in recent weeks, even as both Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Putin face growing political pressure to show results on the battlefield.\nUkraine has held off from mounting a large-scale counteroffensive despite claiming for months that one was coming, and Russia has avoided sharply escalating its assault despite warning that it would retaliate against Ukrainian attacks in the Russian-controlled peninsula of Crimea.\n\u201cExpectations that this will end by Christmas or that this will end by next spring\u201d are misguided, said Ruslan Pukhov, a defense analyst who runs the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a privately-owned think tank in Moscow.\nUkraine, benefiting from a continuing flow of Western weapons like <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $3 billion</span> package that President Biden pledged this week, has the resources and morale to continue to resist the Russian assault. Russia, fighting the war at peacetime strength without mass call-ups of military-age men, appears to have the resources to keep waging a brutal war of attrition \u2014 but not to mount a decisive new offensive.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The largely static period on the battlefield coincides with increasing expectations \u2014 fueled by Ukraine itself \u2014 that Mr. Zelensky\u2019s military will mount some kind of significant offensive, to show that it can make good use of Western-provided weapons and reassure allies that the economic sacrifices they are making will pay off.\n</span>Mr. Putin, as well, faces domestic pressure from far-right nationalists who want stepped-up aggression in Ukraine, particularly after recent strikes on Crimea and the killing of the ultranationalist commentator Daria Dugina in a car bombing last weekend. But the Russian leader, in control of the state media and the political system, is well-situated to ignore such calls, analysts say.\nInstead, Mr. Putin insists that his forces are advancing in eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region \u201cstep by step.\u201d\nHowever, Russia has failed to capture a single major population center since early July. And for Mr. Putin, who justified the invasion by falsely claiming that Ukraine was committing a \u201cgenocide\u201d of Russian speakers in the Donbas, anything short of full control of the region would be seen as a major defeat.\nMr. Putin\u2019s decree on Thursday raised the target number of active-duty Russian service members <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 137,000,</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 1.15 million</span>.\nIn the Russian state media, the message that Russia could only be at the start of a long and existential war against the West \u2014 now being fought, by proxy, in Ukraine \u2014 is sounding with increasing clarity. It is a shift from the messaging six months ago, when Ukrainians were depicted as lacking the will to fight and eagerly awaiting Russian \u201cliberation.\u201d\n\u201cWe will have fewer Russian tourists in Europe, but the size of the Russian army will increase <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 140,000 regular</span> servicemen,\u201d Igor Korotchenko, the editor of a Russian military journal, said on a state television talk show on Thursday. \u201cI expect that this is just the beginning.\u201d\nMilana Mazaeva contributed reporting.\nAs the bloody artillery battle in Ukraine\u2019s east settles into a stalemate, the war appears now to be a waiting game for a long-promised Ukrainian counteroffensive.\nThe timing for any move to break the deadlock has emerged as a pivotal strategic decision for Ukraine\u2019s government. Both sides are preparing for a protracted war, but Ukraine has greater incentive to try to avoid it by undertaking risky maneuvers as early as this fall \u2014 before the rainy season closes the window on possible offensives over open fields.\nFrom the Ukrainian perspective, the mostly static trench fighting cannot go on indefinitely. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Leaving Russia in control of much of the southern coastline would cripple Ukraine\u2019s economy, already cratering from the war and propped up by Western aid.\n</span>The initial target of any counterattack is widely assumed to be Russian positions on the western bank of the Dnipro River. Move too soon, though, and the Ukrainian army may prove unready and insufficiently armed to ensure victory, military analysts say. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Wait too long, and political backing in Europe may waver as energy prices soar.\n</span>Political pressure is mounting for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to make a move even as it remains unclear whether his military has amassed the necessary weaponry and manpower.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe very difficult state of our economy, the constant risks of air and missile attacks and the general fatigue of the population from the difficulties of war will work against Ukraine\u201d over time, Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former minister of defense, wrote in the Ukrainska Pravda newspaper.</span> He said the military should be prepared to advance, rather than defend.\n\u201cIt makes no sense to drag out the war for years and compete to see who will run out of resources first,\u201d he wrote.\nThe Ukrainians pivoted to a new strategy of so-called \u201cdeep war\u201d \u2014 hitting targets far behind the front \u2014 after months of grim artillery duels and street fighting in the eastern region of Luhansk, which ultimately fell under Russian control by early July.\nUsing long-range, precision guided rockets provided by the United States, the Ukrainian military has been softening up Russian positions behind the front line while also striking the Russian-occupied Crimea Peninsula.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The Ukrainian government has said that, since late June, it has hit at <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 154 ammunition</span> depots,<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 91 bases</span> for weapons storage, four barracks housing soldiers, four fuel depots and eight command posts.</span> Those claims could not be independently verified.\nBut Ukraine has for months been telegraphing plans for the major battle in the south \u2014 with the types of weapons it has requested from Western allies and the strategies it pursues on the battlefield offering clues to its approach.\nA recent U.S. military assistance package tellingly included mine-clearing attachments for armored vehicles that would be used in an advance, suggesting preparations for attacks on Russian lines.\nBut more time would bring more Western weaponry: Despite the arrival of artillery systems from NATO members, Ukraine\u2019s arsenal is still largely made up of legacy Soviet arms.\nAt home in Ukraine, Mr. Zelensky has broad support for continuing the war. An opinion poll by the Razumkov Center, a policy research organization in Kyiv, released on Monday <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">showed 92 percent</span> of Ukrainians are confident in a military victory over the Russian army.\nBut Russian plans to stage referendums in occupied territory could lead to a claim of annexation as early as next month, putting additional time pressure on Mr. Zelensky to launch an offensive.\nThe State of the War\n- Defiant Under Attack: Amid the blare of air raid sirens, Ukrainians celebrated their Independence Day with a show of defiance against Russia\u2019s invasion, despite the uncertain course of a war that has so far lasted half a year.\n- Nuclear Plant Standoff: Russian and Ukrainian militaries are continuing to accuse each other of launching missiles and preparing to stage attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. The United Nations issued warnings about the risk of a nuclear disaster and called for a demilitarized zone around the plant.\n- A Brazen Bombing: A car bombing in a Moscow suburb that killed the daughter of a prominent Russian ultranationalist has injected new uncertainty into the war and rattled Russia\u2019s elite.\n- Crimea: With the drumbeat of Ukrainian strikes inside the strategically and symbolically important Kremlin-held territory, the reality of war is becoming increasingly apparent to Russians.\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s largest nuclear plant was reconnected to the national power grid on Friday afternoon, but its time offline renewed concerns about the safe operation of the plant and the consequences for millions of Ukrainians if there are further interruptions to power.\nUkrainian engineers were able to restore damaged external power lines after repeated shelling on Thursday, ensuring the facility was able to meet its own power needs and continue to operate safely, according to Ukrainian and international officials, but efforts to reconnect it to the grid took longer.\nWith fires raging around the plant, new shelling in and around the facility on a near daily basis and an exhausted and stressed team of Ukrainian engineers tasked with keeping the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant running safely, however, calls for international intervention grew louder.\n\u201cNowhere in the history of this world has a nuclear power plant become a part of a combat zone, so this really has to stop immediately,\u201d Bonnie Denise Jenkins, the State Department\u2019s under secretary for arms control and international security, told reporters in Brussels on Thursday. Russian actions, she said, \u201chave created a serious risk of a nuclear incident \u2014 a dangerous radiation release \u2014 that could threaten not only the people and environment of Ukraine, but also affect neighboring countries and the entire international community.\u201d\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine used his nightly address to underscore the risks, saying emergency systems had worked on Thursday, but that, had they failed, the country, and the world, would be contending with a nuclear accident.\nAnd though the immediate threat appeared to have been averted, the disconnection of the plant from the national grid caused widespread power outages across southern Ukraine, adding to the misery wrought by the war. When fully operational, the plant provides electricity for <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some 20 percent</span> of the country, including roughly four million homes.\nThe Zhaporizhzhia regional government said that as of Friday morning, energy supplies were \u201cpartially restored\u201d from other sources. Residents across the region reported widespread power outages overnight and into the morning.\nThe plant was reconnected to the Ukrainian grid at 2:04 p.m., according to Ukraine\u2019s nuclear energy agency, Energoatom. The agency, in a statement, praised the workers at the plant who \u201ctirelessly and firmly hold the nuclear and radiation safety of Ukraine and the whole of Europe on their shoulders.\u201d It was not immediately clear how many people were still without power.\nUkrainians in occupied areas are already living under difficult conditions. In eastern Ukraine, Russian bombardments and fierce fighting have destroyed nearly all of the infrastructure needed to provide heat, power and clean water, leading the Ukrainian government to order a mandatory evacuation of the less <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 200,000 people</span> still living in the eastern Ukrainian region known as Donbas.\nThe situation in the occupied south is more complicated. Many of the towns and cities there fell in the first days of the war and were spared the widespread destruction witnessed in the east. But if the nuclear plant were to go offline again, the power for hundreds of thousands living in occupied territories could be compromised.\n\u201cThe south of Ukraine \u2014 the occupied areas \u2014 is already in a state of humanitarian disaster,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said. \u201cIn addition to all the evil that the occupiers brought there, electricity, water and sewage were cut off.\u201d\nThough the plant\u2019s disconnection from the national grid appeared to be the related to nearby fighting, Ukrainian officials have been warning for weeks that Moscow wants to divert the power from the plant for its own needs by disconnecting it from the Ukrainian grid and then reconnecting it to the Russian grid, a potentially complicated process in a war zone that leaves room for an accident.\nMs. Jenkins, the State Department official, said the U.S. is working through the United Nations Security Council to persuade Moscow not to attempt such a potentially risky move.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want that to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are continuing to talk with Russia and through these Security Council discussions and to impress upon Russia not to do that.\u201d\nIn the six months since Russia invaded, the state media\u2019s emphasis in reporting the war has gradually shifted. Gone are predictions of a lightning offensive that would obliterate Ukraine. There is less talk of being embraced as liberators who must \u201cdenazify\u201d and demilitarize Ukraine, though the \u201cfascist\u201d label is still flung about with abandon.\nInstead, in the Kremlin version \u2014 the only one most Russians see, with all others outlawed \u2014 the battlefields of Ukraine are one facet of a wider civilizational war being waged against Russia.\nThe reporting is less about Ukraine than \u201cabout opposing Western plans to get control of Mother Russia,\u201d said Stanislav Kucher, a veteran Russian television host now consulting on a project to get Russians better access to banned news outlets.\nOn state media, Russia is a pillar of traditional values, bound to prevail over the moral swamp that is the West. But the extent of Russia\u2019s staggering casualties in Ukraine remains veiled; only the Ukrainian military suffers extensive losses.\nState television has played down the mounting Ukrainian attacks on the strategically and symbolically important Crimean peninsula, but the images on social media of antiaircraft fire erupting over Crimea began to put domestic political pressure on the Kremlin.\nThe visceral reality of the war, especially the fact that Russian-claimed territory was not immune, was brought home both by the strikes on Crimea and by what investigators called a premeditated assassination in Moscow.\nDaria Dugina,<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 29,</span> the daughter of a famous nationalist and herself a hawk, was killed by a car bomb late Saturday, with official news outlets blaming Ukraine and its Western backers.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Glimpses of the war\u2019s cost, however, remain the exception, as news and talk shows have branched into myriad economic and social topics to try to hammer home the idea that Russia is locked in a broad conflict with the West.\n</span>Lev Gudkov, the research director at the Levada Center, an independent polling organization, said the government explains European and American hostility by saying that \u201cRussia is getting stronger and that is why the West is trying to get in Russia\u2019s way,\u201d part of a general rhetorical line he described as \u201cblatant lies and demagogy.\u201d\nAs state television stokes confrontation, the talk show warriors are getting \u201cangrier and more aggressive,\u201d said Ilya Shepelin, who broadcasts a Russian press review on YouTube for the opposition organization founded by the imprisoned Kremlin critic Aleksei A. Navalny.\nThe warning by a top U.S. official this week that Russia is preparing to stage \u201csham\u201d referendums in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine has brought back bad memories of similar episodes from the country\u2019s recent history.\nDespite widespread international condemnation, Moscow and its proxies orchestrated two sets of referendums in Ukraine in 2014: first in Russian-annexed Crimea, and then months later in parts of the eastern Donbas region controlled by Kremlin-backed separatist forces.\nNow, Washington is warning that history is likely to repeat itself. \u201cWe expect Russia to try to manipulate the results of these referenda under the false claim of the Ukrainian people wanting to join Russia,\u201d John F. Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, told reporters on Wednesday, adding that votes could take place as early as this weekend.\nFor months, Russia has been laying the groundwork to hold referendums in the territories it has captured, part of a strategy to provide a veneer of legitimacy as it moves to annex those parts of the country.\nThe Russian curriculum is being taught in schools. Ukrainians are being encouraged to apply for Russian passports to access state benefits. The Russian authorities have even rerouted mobile phone and internet connections through Russia\u2019s censored networks and, in some areas, blocked access to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, as well as to Ukrainian news websites and other independent sources of information.\n\u201cOne trick we can expect Russia to repeat is holding a referendum which doesn\u2019t actually give voters any choice,\u201d said Keir Giles, a Russia expert at Chatham House, a London-based research institute. \u201c<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014,</span></span> people in Crimea voting at gunpoint had two choices on the ballot slip; neither of them was returning to being governed by Ukraine.\u201d\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">However, in contrast to the Crimea referendums <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014,</span></span> when international condemnation was strong, Mr. Giles said some European leaders may be less vocal now in their criticism of potential referendums, however dubious they may be, if the entrenchment of Russian control curbs the fighting and lessens the global economic impact of the war.\n</span>The U.S. intelligence assessment that referendums could be held as soon as this weekend has led many observers in Ukraine, Washington and Brussels to suspect that Russia is attempting to create a bulwark against a long-expected Ukrainian counteroffensive by annexing territory and solidifying Russian control on the ground.\nHowever, some experts stressed that the referendums would do little to alter the war\u2019s dynamics or to change the hearts and minds of Ukrainians in areas loyal to Kyiv.\n\u201cThe referendums will have no influence on the battlefield,\u201d said Oleg Ignatov, senior Russia analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. \u201cIf anyone thinks that these referendums will allow them to hold onto these occupied territories, it is very na\u00efve.\u201d\nMr. Ignatov added that any referendum that leads to the annexation of Ukrainian territories would push Kyiv away from the negotiating table, depriving Moscow of an \u201cexit strategy\u201d and locking it into a protracted conflict.\nIn August, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine warned that any Russian-orchestrated referendum in occupied areas of his country would end all chances of peace talks with Ukraine.\nMr. Ignatov said that any new referendums in occupied territories in Ukraine would not be credible given that hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have already fled the occupied regions and would not be able to vote.\n\u201cIt is nonsense,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not be able to believe any results from these referendums.\u201d\nCluster munitions have killed at <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 689 people</span> in Ukraine in the six months since Russia invaded the country, the Cluster Munition Coalition, an international disarmament group, said in its annual report on Thursday.\nCluster munitions include bombs, missiles, rockets, mortar and artillery shells that open midair to dispense smaller weapons or bomblets over a large area that are designed to detonate on impact. Civilians can be easily caught in their path.\nAnd the many bomblets that do not detonate are still volatile, and can explode later if they are picked up or handled. <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2021,</span> the Cluster Munition Coalition documented incidents in Laos and Lebanon in which groups of children were injured or killed from playing with remnants of cluster munitions.\nThe researchers could not establish whether all of the <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 700 people</span> killed by the munitions were civilians, as the status of some had not been reported, but said that it was clear that the vast majority were not combatants.\n\u201cThe civilian harm from the use of cluster munitions in Ukraine is a devastating development that overshadows this year\u2019s report,\u201d Mary Wareham, the arms advocacy director at Human Rights Watch and editor of the report, said in a phone interview. Human Rights Watch chairs the Cluster Munition Coalition.\nMore <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100 countries</span>, including most of NATO\u2019s member states, agreed to ban the weapons in the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which took effect <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010.</span> However, Russia, Ukraine and the United States are not signatories.\nUkraine is the only country where cluster munitions are currently being used, the report said. Both sides in the current war have been documented using the weapons, but Russian troops have used them far more extensively.\nHundreds of Russian attacks with cluster munitions have been documented, reported or alleged <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 10 of</span> Ukraine\u2019s official regions, according to the new report, while Ukrainian forces have used them at least three times. Russia has used both old stores of cluster munitions and at least two types of newly developed varieties, the report said.\nThroughout the war, Russia has shown its willingness to strike civilian targets, including theaters, hospitals and apartment buildings. On Monday, the United Nations reported that it had confirmed the deaths <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 5,587 Ukrainian</span> civilians. The true number is thought to be in the tens of thousands.\nHuman Rights Watch released an investigation last week that found that, in May and June alone, Russian forces launched cluster munitions in Kharkiv that struck homes, city streets, parks, a cultural center and an outpatient clinic at a maternity hospital.\nIn a statement about the new report, Jeff Meer, the U.S. executive director of Humanity & Inclusion, an independent aid organization, said, \u201cWe know two things for sure about cluster munitions: they are indiscriminate weapons, <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 98 percent</span> of causalities are civilians.\u201d\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. State Department and Yale University researchers said Thursday that they had identified at <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 21 sites</span> in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine that the Russian military or Russian-backed Ukrainian separatists are using to detain, interrogate or deport civilians and prisoners of war in ways that violate international humanitarian law. There were signs pointing to possible mass graves in some areas, they said.\nResearchers at the Yale School of Public Health\u2019s Humanitarian Research Lab said the sites were part of a \u201cfiltration system\u201d used for processing detainees and prisoners. They reached their conclusions after examining commercial satellite imagery and open-source information. The detainees and prisoners could be forced to live outside the centers in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, imprisoned for long periods, deported to Russia or even killed.\nThe research was a collaboration between Yale and the Conflict Observatory program that the State Department set up in May to document war crimes and other atrocities committed by Russian or Russian-backed forces in the Ukraine war. The researchers released their findings through a report from Conflict Observatory.\n\u201cWe again call on Russia to immediately halt its filtration operations and forced deportations and to provide outside independent observers access to identified facilities and forced deportation relocation areas within Russia-controlled areas of Ukraine and inside Russia itself,\u201d the State Department said in a statement referring to the new findings.\nThe report identified four types of centers in the filtration system: registration, holding, secondary interrogation and detention.\nThe researchers also found evidence of disturbed earth on two recent occasions at the Volnovakha \u201ccorrectional colony\u201d near the village of Olenivka that they said was consistent with mass graves. The appearance of disturbed earth predated an explosion on <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 29 at</span> the prison compound that <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">killed 53 Ukrainian</span> prisoners of war.\nOne area of disturbed earth appeared in imagery from <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 11 </span>\u2014 \u201ccontemporaneous with an open source account of alleged gravedigging,\u201d the report said, referring to an online account in which a former inmate discussed a cellmate working a shift digging graves. A second area of disturbed earth appeared on <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 27,</span> two days before the explosion.\nA New York Times analysis from early August of images from Maxar Technologies and Planet Labs, two satellite imaging companies, concluded that some time after <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 18 and</span> before <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 21,</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 15 to</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20 spots</span> of notable changes to the ground appeared on the southern side of the complex.

Putin\u2019s decision this week to expand the size of his military offered further evidence for a conviction taking hold in both Russia and Ukraine: The two sides are settling in for the long haul in a war that could last another year, or longer.\nMr. Putin, secure in his power and having silenced dissent, appears to have little incentive to stop the war, which he has now waged for more than six months without declaring a nationwide draft that could have provoked domestic discontent.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, warning his nation on Friday that the coming winter would be \u201cthe most difficult in our history,\u201d is being bolstered by a largely unified West and a defiant populace in his insistence that there will be no compromise with an invading army.\nThe conflict has settled into a war of attrition, with little movement along the front line in recent weeks, even as both Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Putin face growing political pressure to show results on the battlefield.\nUkraine has held off from mounting a large-scale counteroffensive despite claiming for months that one was coming, and Russia has avoided sharply escalating its assault despite warning that it would retaliate against Ukrainian attacks in the Russian-controlled peninsula of Crimea.\n\u201cExpectations that this will end by Christmas or that this will end by next spring\u201d are misguided, said Ruslan Pukhov, a defense analyst who runs the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a privately-owned think tank in Moscow.\nUkraine, benefiting from a continuing flow of Western weapons like <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $3 billion</span> package that President Biden pledged this week, has the resources and morale to continue to resist the Russian assault. Russia, fighting the war at peacetime strength without mass call-ups of military-age men, appears to have the resources to keep waging a brutal war of attrition \u2014 but not to mount a decisive new offensive.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The largely static period on the battlefield coincides with increasing expectations \u2014 fueled by Ukraine itself \u2014 that Mr. Zelensky\u2019s military will mount some kind of significant offensive, to show that it can make good use of Western-provided weapons and reassure allies that the economic sacrifices they are making will pay off.\n</span>Mr. Putin, as well, faces domestic pressure from far-right nationalists who want stepped-up aggression in Ukraine, particularly after recent strikes on Crimea and the killing of the ultranationalist commentator Daria Dugina in a car bombing last weekend. But the Russian leader, in control of the state media and the political system, is well-situated to ignore such calls, analysts say.\nInstead, Mr. Putin insists that his forces are advancing in eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region \u201cstep by step.\u201d\nHowever, Russia has failed to capture a single major population center since early July. And for Mr. Putin, who justified the invasion by falsely claiming that Ukraine was committing a \u201cgenocide\u201d of Russian speakers in the Donbas, anything short of full control of the region would be seen as a major defeat.\nMr. Putin\u2019s decree on Thursday raised the target number of active-duty Russian service members <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 137,000,</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 1.15 million</span>.\nIn the Russian state media, the message that Russia could only be at the start of a long and existential war against the West \u2014 now being fought, by proxy, in Ukraine \u2014 is sounding with increasing clarity. It is a shift from the messaging six months ago, when Ukrainians were depicted as lacking the will to fight and eagerly awaiting Russian \u201cliberation.\u201d\n\u201cWe will have fewer Russian tourists in Europe, but the size of the Russian army will increase <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 140,000 regular</span> servicemen,\u201d Igor Korotchenko, the editor of a Russian military journal, said on a state television talk show on Thursday. \u201cI expect that this is just the beginning.\u201d\nMilana Mazaeva contributed reporting.\nAs the bloody artillery battle in Ukraine\u2019s east settles into a stalemate, the war appears now to be a waiting game for a long-promised Ukrainian counteroffensive.\nThe timing for any move to break the deadlock has emerged as a pivotal strategic decision for Ukraine\u2019s government. Both sides are preparing for a protracted war, but Ukraine has greater incentive to try to avoid it by undertaking risky maneuvers as early as this fall \u2014 before the rainy season closes the window on possible offensives over open fields.\nFrom the Ukrainian perspective, the mostly static trench fighting cannot go on indefinitely. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Leaving Russia in control of much of the southern coastline would cripple Ukraine\u2019s economy, already cratering from the war and propped up by Western aid.\n</span>The initial target of any counterattack is widely assumed to be Russian positions on the western bank of the Dnipro River. Move too soon, though, and the Ukrainian army may prove unready and insufficiently armed to ensure victory, military analysts say. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Wait too long, and political backing in Europe may waver as energy prices soar.\n</span>Political pressure is mounting for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to make a move even as it remains unclear whether his military has amassed the necessary weaponry and manpower.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe very difficult state of our economy, the constant risks of air and missile attacks and the general fatigue of the population from the difficulties of war will work against Ukraine\u201d over time, Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former minister of defense, wrote in the Ukrainska Pravda newspaper.</span> He said the military should be prepared to advance, rather than defend.\n\u201cIt makes no sense to drag out the war for years and compete to see who will run out of resources first,\u201d he wrote.\nThe Ukrainians pivoted to a new strategy of so-called \u201cdeep war\u201d \u2014 hitting targets far behind the front \u2014 after months of grim artillery duels and street fighting in the eastern region of Luhansk, which ultimately fell under Russian control by early July.\nUsing long-range, precision guided rockets provided by the United States, the Ukrainian military has been softening up Russian positions behind the front line while also striking the Russian-occupied Crimea Peninsula.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The Ukrainian government has said that, since late June, it has hit at <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 154 ammunition</span> depots,<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 91 bases</span> for weapons storage, four barracks housing soldiers, four fuel depots and eight command posts.</span> Those claims could not be independently verified.\nBut Ukraine has for months been telegraphing plans for the major battle in the south \u2014 with the types of weapons it has requested from Western allies and the strategies it pursues on the battlefield offering clues to its approach.\nA recent U.S. military assistance package tellingly included mine-clearing attachments for armored vehicles that would be used in an advance, suggesting preparations for attacks on Russian lines.\nBut more time would bring more Western weaponry: Despite the arrival of artillery systems from NATO members, Ukraine\u2019s arsenal is still largely made up of legacy Soviet arms.\nAt home in Ukraine, Mr. Zelensky has broad support for continuing the war. An opinion poll by the Razumkov Center, a policy research organization in Kyiv, released on Monday <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">showed 92 percent</span> of Ukrainians are confident in a military victory over the Russian army.\nBut Russian plans to stage referendums in occupied territory could lead to a claim of annexation as early as next month, putting additional time pressure on Mr. Zelensky to launch an offensive.\nThe State of the War\n- Defiant Under Attack: Amid the blare of air raid sirens, Ukrainians celebrated their Independence Day with a show of defiance against Russia\u2019s invasion, despite the uncertain course of a war that has so far lasted half a year.\n- Nuclear Plant Standoff: Russian and Ukrainian militaries are continuing to accuse each other of launching missiles and preparing to stage attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. The United Nations issued warnings about the risk of a nuclear disaster and called for a demilitarized zone around the plant.\n- A Brazen Bombing: A car bombing in a Moscow suburb that killed the daughter of a prominent Russian ultranationalist has injected new uncertainty into the war and rattled Russia\u2019s elite.\n- Crimea: With the drumbeat of Ukrainian strikes inside the strategically and symbolically important Kremlin-held territory, the reality of war is becoming increasingly apparent to Russians.\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s largest nuclear plant was reconnected to the national power grid on Friday afternoon, but its time offline renewed concerns about the safe operation of the plant and the consequences for millions of Ukrainians if there are further interruptions to power.\nUkrainian engineers were able to restore damaged external power lines after repeated shelling on Thursday, ensuring the facility was able to meet its own power needs and continue to operate safely, according to Ukrainian and international officials, but efforts to reconnect it to the grid took longer.\nWith fires raging around the plant, new shelling in and around the facility on a near daily basis and an exhausted and stressed team of Ukrainian engineers tasked with keeping the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant running safely, however, calls for international intervention grew louder.\n\u201cNowhere in the history of this world has a nuclear power plant become a part of a combat zone, so this really has to stop immediately,\u201d Bonnie Denise Jenkins, the State Department\u2019s under secretary for arms control and international security, told reporters in Brussels on Thursday. Russian actions, she said, \u201chave created a serious risk of a nuclear incident \u2014 a dangerous radiation release \u2014 that could threaten not only the people and environment of Ukraine, but also affect neighboring countries and the entire international community.\u201d\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine used his nightly address to underscore the risks, saying emergency systems had worked on Thursday, but that, had they failed, the country, and the world, would be contending with a nuclear accident.\nAnd though the immediate threat appeared to have been averted, the disconnection of the plant from the national grid caused widespread power outages across southern Ukraine, adding to the misery wrought by the war. When fully operational, the plant provides electricity for <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some 20 percent</span> of the country, including roughly four million homes.\nThe Zhaporizhzhia regional government said that as of Friday morning, energy supplies were \u201cpartially restored\u201d from other sources. Residents across the region reported widespread power outages overnight and into the morning.\nThe plant was reconnected to the Ukrainian grid at 2:04 p.m., according to Ukraine\u2019s nuclear energy agency, Energoatom. The agency, in a statement, praised the workers at the plant who \u201ctirelessly and firmly hold the nuclear and radiation safety of Ukraine and the whole of Europe on their shoulders.\u201d It was not immediately clear how many people were still without power.\nUkrainians in occupied areas are already living under difficult conditions. In eastern Ukraine, Russian bombardments and fierce fighting have destroyed nearly all of the infrastructure needed to provide heat, power and clean water, leading the Ukrainian government to order a mandatory evacuation of the less <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 200,000 people</span> still living in the eastern Ukrainian region known as Donbas.\nThe situation in the occupied south is more complicated. Many of the towns and cities there fell in the first days of the war and were spared the widespread destruction witnessed in the east. But if the nuclear plant were to go offline again, the power for hundreds of thousands living in occupied territories could be compromised.\n\u201cThe south of Ukraine \u2014 the occupied areas \u2014 is already in a state of humanitarian disaster,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said. \u201cIn addition to all the evil that the occupiers brought there, electricity, water and sewage were cut off.\u201d\nThough the plant\u2019s disconnection from the national grid appeared to be the related to nearby fighting, Ukrainian officials have been warning for weeks that Moscow wants to divert the power from the plant for its own needs by disconnecting it from the Ukrainian grid and then reconnecting it to the Russian grid, a potentially complicated process in a war zone that leaves room for an accident.\nMs. Jenkins, the State Department official, said the U.S. is working through the United Nations Security Council to persuade Moscow not to attempt such a potentially risky move.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want that to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are continuing to talk with Russia and through these Security Council discussions and to impress upon Russia not to do that.\u201d\nIn the six months since Russia invaded, the state media\u2019s emphasis in reporting the war has gradually shifted. Gone are predictions of a lightning offensive that would obliterate Ukraine. There is less talk of being embraced as liberators who must \u201cdenazify\u201d and demilitarize Ukraine, though the \u201cfascist\u201d label is still flung about with abandon.\nInstead, in the Kremlin version \u2014 the only one most Russians see, with all others outlawed \u2014 the battlefields of Ukraine are one facet of a wider civilizational war being waged against Russia.\nThe reporting is less about Ukraine than \u201cabout opposing Western plans to get control of Mother Russia,\u201d said Stanislav Kucher, a veteran Russian television host now consulting on a project to get Russians better access to banned news outlets.\nOn state media, Russia is a pillar of traditional values, bound to prevail over the moral swamp that is the West. But the extent of Russia\u2019s staggering casualties in Ukraine remains veiled; only the Ukrainian military suffers extensive losses.\nState television has played down the mounting Ukrainian attacks on the strategically and symbolically important Crimean peninsula, but the images on social media of antiaircraft fire erupting over Crimea began to put domestic political pressure on the Kremlin.\nThe visceral reality of the war, especially the fact that Russian-claimed territory was not immune, was brought home both by the strikes on Crimea and by what investigators called a premeditated assassination in Moscow.\nDaria Dugina,<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 29,</span> the daughter of a famous nationalist and herself a hawk, was killed by a car bomb late Saturday, with official news outlets blaming Ukraine and its Western backers.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Glimpses of the war\u2019s cost, however, remain the exception, as news and talk shows have branched into myriad economic and social topics to try to hammer home the idea that Russia is locked in a broad conflict with the West.\n</span>Lev Gudkov, the research director at the Levada Center, an independent polling organization, said the government explains European and American hostility by saying that \u201cRussia is getting stronger and that is why the West is trying to get in Russia\u2019s way,\u201d part of a general rhetorical line he described as \u201cblatant lies and demagogy.\u201d\nAs state television stokes confrontation, the talk show warriors are getting \u201cangrier and more aggressive,\u201d said Ilya Shepelin, who broadcasts a Russian press review on YouTube for the opposition organization founded by the imprisoned Kremlin critic Aleksei A. Navalny.\nThe warning by a top U.S. official this week that Russia is preparing to stage \u201csham\u201d referendums in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine has brought back bad memories of similar episodes from the country\u2019s recent history.\nDespite widespread international condemnation, Moscow and its proxies orchestrated two sets of referendums in Ukraine in 2014: first in Russian-annexed Crimea, and then months later in parts of the eastern Donbas region controlled by Kremlin-backed separatist forces.\nNow, Washington is warning that history is likely to repeat itself. \u201cWe expect Russia to try to manipulate the results of these referenda under the false claim of the Ukrainian people wanting to join Russia,\u201d John F. Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, told reporters on Wednesday, adding that votes could take place as early as this weekend.\nFor months, Russia has been laying the groundwork to hold referendums in the territories it has captured, part of a strategy to provide a veneer of legitimacy as it moves to annex those parts of the country.\nThe Russian curriculum is being taught in schools. Ukrainians are being encouraged to apply for Russian passports to access state benefits. The Russian authorities have even rerouted mobile phone and internet connections through Russia\u2019s censored networks and, in some areas, blocked access to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, as well as to Ukrainian news websites and other independent sources of information.\n\u201cOne trick we can expect Russia to repeat is holding a referendum which doesn\u2019t actually give voters any choice,\u201d said Keir Giles, a Russia expert at Chatham House, a London-based research institute. \u201c<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014,</span></span> people in Crimea voting at gunpoint had two choices on the ballot slip; neither of them was returning to being governed by Ukraine.\u201d\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">However, in contrast to the Crimea referendums <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2014,</span></span> when international condemnation was strong, Mr. Giles said some European leaders may be less vocal now in their criticism of potential referendums, however dubious they may be, if the entrenchment of Russian control curbs the fighting and lessens the global economic impact of the war.\n</span>The U.S. intelligence assessment that referendums could be held as soon as this weekend has led many observers in Ukraine, Washington and Brussels to suspect that Russia is attempting to create a bulwark against a long-expected Ukrainian counteroffensive by annexing territory and solidifying Russian control on the ground.\nHowever, some experts stressed that the referendums would do little to alter the war\u2019s dynamics or to change the hearts and minds of Ukrainians in areas loyal to Kyiv.\n\u201cThe referendums will have no influence on the battlefield,\u201d said Oleg Ignatov, senior Russia analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. \u201cIf anyone thinks that these referendums will allow them to hold onto these occupied territories, it is very na\u00efve.\u201d\nMr. Ignatov added that any referendum that leads to the annexation of Ukrainian territories would push Kyiv away from the negotiating table, depriving Moscow of an \u201cexit strategy\u201d and locking it into a protracted conflict.\nIn August, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine warned that any Russian-orchestrated referendum in occupied areas of his country would end all chances of peace talks with Ukraine.\nMr. Ignatov said that any new referendums in occupied territories in Ukraine would not be credible given that hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have already fled the occupied regions and would not be able to vote.\n\u201cIt is nonsense,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not be able to believe any results from these referendums.\u201d\nCluster munitions have killed at <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 689 people</span> in Ukraine in the six months since Russia invaded the country, the Cluster Munition Coalition, an international disarmament group, said in its annual report on Thursday.\nCluster munitions include bombs, missiles, rockets, mortar and artillery shells that open midair to dispense smaller weapons or bomblets over a large area that are designed to detonate on impact. Civilians can be easily caught in their path.\nAnd the many bomblets that do not detonate are still volatile, and can explode later if they are picked up or handled. <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2021,</span> the Cluster Munition Coalition documented incidents in Laos and Lebanon in which groups of children were injured or killed from playing with remnants of cluster munitions.\nThe researchers could not establish whether all of the <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 700 people</span> killed by the munitions were civilians, as the status of some had not been reported, but said that it was clear that the vast majority were not combatants.\n\u201cThe civilian harm from the use of cluster munitions in Ukraine is a devastating development that overshadows this year\u2019s report,\u201d Mary Wareham, the arms advocacy director at Human Rights Watch and editor of the report, said in a phone interview. Human Rights Watch chairs the Cluster Munition Coalition.\nMore <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100 countries</span>, including most of NATO\u2019s member states, agreed to ban the weapons in the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which took effect <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010.</span> However, Russia, Ukraine and the United States are not signatories.\nUkraine is the only country where cluster munitions are currently being used, the report said. Both sides in the current war have been documented using the weapons, but Russian troops have used them far more extensively.\nHundreds of Russian attacks with cluster munitions have been documented, reported or alleged <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 10 of</span> Ukraine\u2019s official regions, according to the new report, while Ukrainian forces have used them at least three times. Russia has used both old stores of cluster munitions and at least two types of newly developed varieties, the report said.\nThroughout the war, Russia has shown its willingness to strike civilian targets, including theaters, hospitals and apartment buildings. On Monday, the United Nations reported that it had confirmed the deaths <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 5,587 Ukrainian</span> civilians. The true number is thought to be in the tens of thousands.\nHuman Rights Watch released an investigation last week that found that, in May and June alone, Russian forces launched cluster munitions in Kharkiv that struck homes, city streets, parks, a cultural center and an outpatient clinic at a maternity hospital.\nIn a statement about the new report, Jeff Meer, the U.S. executive director of Humanity & Inclusion, an independent aid organization, said, \u201cWe know two things for sure about cluster munitions: they are indiscriminate weapons, <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 98 percent</span> of causalities are civilians.\u201d\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. State Department and Yale University researchers said Thursday that they had identified at <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 21 sites</span> in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine that the Russian military or Russian-backed Ukrainian separatists are using to detain, interrogate or deport civilians and prisoners of war in ways that violate international humanitarian law. There were signs pointing to possible mass graves in some areas, they said.\nResearchers at the Yale School of Public Health\u2019s Humanitarian Research Lab said the sites were part of a \u201cfiltration system\u201d used for processing detainees and prisoners. They reached their conclusions after examining commercial satellite imagery and open-source information. The detainees and prisoners could be forced to live outside the centers in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, imprisoned for long periods, deported to Russia or even killed.\nThe research was a collaboration between Yale and the Conflict Observatory program that the State Department set up in May to document war crimes and other atrocities committed by Russian or Russian-backed forces in the Ukraine war. The researchers released their findings through a report from Conflict Observatory.\n\u201cWe again call on Russia to immediately halt its filtration operations and forced deportations and to provide outside independent observers access to identified facilities and forced deportation relocation areas within Russia-controlled areas of Ukraine and inside Russia itself,\u201d the State Department said in a statement referring to the new findings.\nThe report identified four types of centers in the filtration system: registration, holding, secondary interrogation and detention.\nThe researchers also found evidence of disturbed earth on two recent occasions at the Volnovakha \u201ccorrectional colony\u201d near the village of Olenivka that they said was consistent with mass graves. The appearance of disturbed earth predated an explosion on <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 29 at</span> the prison compound that <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">killed 53 Ukrainian</span> prisoners of war.\nOne area of disturbed earth appeared in imagery from <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 11 </span>\u2014 \u201ccontemporaneous with an open source account of alleged gravedigging,\u201d the report said, referring to an online account in which a former inmate discussed a cellmate working a shift digging graves. A second area of disturbed earth appeared on <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 27,</span> two days before the explosion.\nA New York Times analysis from early August of images from Maxar Technologies and Planet Labs, two satellite imaging companies, concluded that some time after <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 18 and</span> before <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 21,</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 15 to</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 20 spots</span> of notable changes to the ground appeared on the southern side of the complex. They were <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 6 to</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 7 feet</span> wide <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 10 to</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 16 feet</span> long at first, and some later appeared to have been lengthened to merge. It was unclear whether they were grave sites.\nThe Conflict Observatory report said the Volnovakha center was being used as a long-term detention center for civilians being kept under the auspices of \u201cadministrative detention\u201d and for holding prisoners of war, particularly Ukrainians who surrendered after the siege of Azovstal, in the coastal city of Mariupol. \u201cFiltration\u201d activities appear to have begun there in late March and have continued since then.\nThe researchers noted that there had been reports of torture, beatings, lack of water and proper nutrition, unhygienic conditions and overcrowded cells at the compound.\nThe State Department said it was giving an <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">additional $9 million</span> to the Conflict Observatory through the European Democratic Resilience Initiative.\n\u201cThis focus on accountability lays the foundation for future civil and criminal legal processes, whether in Ukraine, through international mechanisms, or in third-party countries that have established jurisdiction,\u201d it said.\n\u201cPresident Putin and his government will not be able to engage in these persistent abuses with impunity,\u201d the department added. \u201cAccountability is imperative, and the United States and our partners will not be silent.\u201d\nIn June, the U.S. National Intelligence Council released an unclassified report that said it had <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">identified 18 possible</span> locations in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine and western Russia where detainees and prisoners were being held and processed."}, "25482": {"id": "25482", "text": "<h3>GOP strategy elevates clashes over crime, race in midterm battlegrounds</h3>One Republican commercial casts Mandela Barnes as a \u201cdifferent\u201d Democrat, and points out his push to end cash bail. Another shows his face on a wall with his last name sprayed in graffiti-style script and highlights a comment he made about reallocating police funds. A third labels him \u201cdangerously liberal on crime.\u201d\nRepublicans have said the ads are part of a broader strategy of calling out Democrats on crime, an argument they believe will be potent in the closing stage of this year\u2019s midterm elections. But some allies of Barnes, who would be Wisconsin\u2019s first Black senator, have derided the attacks as racist messages that feed on stereotypes. As he faces a torrent of negative ads, Barnes has launched spots seeking to assure voters he will fight crime and support law enforcement. Yet some Democrats said they fear his response has been ineffective.\nThe tensions playing out in Wisconsin mark one of the starkest examples of a trend that has swept across the midterm landscape with about six weeks left until Election Day: Republicans are increasingly centering their pitch to voters on crime, casting Democrats as weak and ineffective buffers against violent criminal conduct. As Republicans advance that argument, they are drawing growing accusations from Democrats that they are engaging in a pattern of stoking racial divisions, a charge they reject.\nAt the same time, Democrats worry the attacks could resonate amid the rise in violent crime that has taken place with their party in power at the federal level and in many cities. Some candidates are scrambling to distance themselves from slogans such as \u201cDefund the police\u201d that were popular among left-wing activists after a reckoning on racial justice and policing two years ago but have complicated the party\u2019s image more broadly since that time, according to strategists across the political spectrum.\nHomicide rates in the country\u2019s cities have spiked over the past two years, with officials pointing to pandemic-related changes to the criminal justice system and, in some cases, less stringent policing policies.

After spending much of this election cycle with a clear advantage in the midterms, the GOP appeared to lose some ground over the summer in the battle for Congress, and party strategists hope running on crime will help them regain their footing in the final weeks.\nDuring the first three weeks of September, the Republican candidates and allies aired <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 53,000 commercials</span> on crime, according to AdImpact, which tracks political spots on network TV. That\u2019s up from <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 29,000 crime</span> ads they aired in all of August. <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Nearly 50 percent</span> of all Republican online ads in battleground states have focused on policing and safety since the start of the month, according to data from Priorities USA, a group focused on electing Democrats.\nThe Republican messaging often seeks to tie Democratic candidates to calls to defund the police and abolish U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, even as most nominees do not subscribe to those views. In other cases, Republicans single out policies promoted more directly by Democratic candidates, including limiting or redirecting police funding and changing the way bail regulations work.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">One ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with the House GOP leadership, asserts that Democratic candidate Liz Mathis, running in Iowa\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, is \u201cnot an ordinary Democrat\u201d and associates her with the defund-the-police movement, saying she once marched with a group that supports the cause and employed a campaign staff member who has backed it.\n</span>In an interview, Mathis said she anticipated the attacks that she\u2019s soft on crime even though she has voted repeatedly to increase funding for law enforcement, and prerecorded a rebuttal advertisement that features two local sheriffs vouching for her and rejecting calls to defund the police.

Some Democrats said they see a more sinister strategy reminiscent of past elections, involving racial stereotypes and playing on voters\u2019 worst instincts.\nIn Wisconsin on Wednesday, a group of activists and lawmakers called on the GOP to remove its ads targeting Barnes on crime. \u201cWe\u2019re out here standing up for the truth demanding that these divisive, racist ads be taken down,\u201d said state Sen. Chris Larson (D), describing them as \u201ca blatant attempt to gin up fear.\u201d\nSome of the ads, including from the Senate Leadership Fund super PAC, seek to connect Barnes\u2019s authorship of a measure to end cash bail to the driver of a vehicle who killed six at Christmas parade in Waukesha. The man charged in that case had been released on <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $1,000 bond</span> before driving an SUV through the crowd. The trial in that case is set to begin in early October.\nBarnes rejects the assertion that his plan would have freed the suspect, noting that his initiative would require judges to hold defendants if there is \u201ca substantial risk\u201d that the defendant could \u201ccause serious bodily harm\u201d to people in the community.\nCornell Belcher, who was a pollster for Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns and watched some of the ads against Barnes, said they play \u201cin the continuum of the politics of victimization.\u201d\n\u201cThis is Willie <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Horton 2.0,</span>\u201d Belcher added, referring to <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 1988 GOP</span> ad intended to paint then-Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis as soft on crime. It featured a Black man who was released from a Massachusetts prison on a furlough program and went on to rape a White woman.\nWhen shown a different ad from the NRSC attacking Barnes that features his name scrawled in graffiti, Belcher, who is Black, was uncharacteristically at a loss for words. \u201cThe imagery of that ad to me is just as important as the words in that ad,\u201d Belcher said. \u201cThey\u2019re attempting to ghettoize him.\u201d\nChris Hartline, a spokesman for the NRSC, rejected that the advertisements play on racial tropes. \u201cCrime destroys all people, regardless of race,\u201d Hartline said in a statement. \u201cAnd Mandela Barnes has supported a radical, soft-on-crime agenda.\u201d\nThe crime ads, and other attacks against Barnes, ramped up in the end of August. As they\u2019ve hit the airwaves, the share of voters with an unfavorable impression of Barnes has risen, according to polling from Marquette Law School.\nCharles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School poll, said the ads against Barnes have come \u201cfast and furious\u201d and have probably contributed to the worsening of his numbers.\nIn a statement, Barnes spokeswoman Maddy McDaniel said Sen.

Another shows his face on a wall with his last name sprayed in graffiti-style script and highlights a comment he made about reallocating police funds. A third labels him \u201cdangerously liberal on crime.\u201d\nRepublicans have said the ads are part of a broader strategy of calling out Democrats on crime, an argument they believe will be potent in the closing stage of this year\u2019s midterm elections. But some allies of Barnes, who would be Wisconsin\u2019s first Black senator, have derided the attacks as racist messages that feed on stereotypes. As he faces a torrent of negative ads, Barnes has launched spots seeking to assure voters he will fight crime and support law enforcement. Yet some Democrats said they fear his response has been ineffective.\nThe tensions playing out in Wisconsin mark one of the starkest examples of a trend that has swept across the midterm landscape with about six weeks left until Election Day: Republicans are increasingly centering their pitch to voters on crime, casting Democrats as weak and ineffective buffers against violent criminal conduct. As Republicans advance that argument, they are drawing growing accusations from Democrats that they are engaging in a pattern of stoking racial divisions, a charge they reject.\nAt the same time, Democrats worry the attacks could resonate amid the rise in violent crime that has taken place with their party in power at the federal level and in many cities.

worry economy is slumping faster than Beijing anticipated\n\nUpdated Aug.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2015 9</span>:02 pm ET\n\nBEIJING\u2014Less than three months before China shocked markets with a surprise devaluation of its currency, a top Chinese exchange-rate official told a closed-door gathering that Beijing had no need for such a dramatic move.\n\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">\u201cDoes a deteriorating economy mean there must be a devaluation of the renminbi?\u201d said Yi Gang, the No.<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2 official</span> at the People\u2019s Bank of China, using an alternative name for the currency.</span> \u201cNot necessarily.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">According to a transcript reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Yi told government officials, academics, businesspeople and investors at the <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 22 event</span> in Shanghai that China still had a \u201cvery large\u201d trade surplus that should support the currency.\n\n</span>Now, China has done a U-turn.\n\nOn Tuesday it pushed the yuan into the largest devaluation in its history, cutting its value against the dollar <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 1.9%.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The move roiled financial markets and set off worries that other central banks would follow suit.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">At home, it signals that Beijing is growing increasingly worried about its slowdown in economic growth.</span> Abroad, the move risks further chilling relations between Beijing and Washington ahead of President Xi Jinping\u2019s meeting with Barack Obama in the U.S. next month.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The currency move came as officials in China\u2019s Commerce Ministry, which oversees exports, and others expressed concern that the economy is slumping faster than China\u2019s leadership had anticipated, according to Chinese officials and government advisers.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Chinese officials also worried about this summer\u2019s confidence-shaking stock-market rout.</span> Overall, it suggests that China\u2019s leaders are looking for new ways to rev up growth as other methods look increasingly ineffective, raising the possibility of further and more dramatic efforts to come.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Tuesday\u2019s move shows Beijing is struggling to balance propping the economy with economic reform.</span> The Chinese leadership is shifting toward stabilizing growth rather than accelerating reforms such as opening the country up for freer cross-border capital flows, according to the Chinese officials and advisers to the government. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Behind the push is Mr. Xi, who they say over the past two months has repeatedly told local officials that \u201cmaintaining economic growth\u201d as the government\u2019s top priority for both near term and the next five years.\n\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">\u201cXi has more than once brought up stabilizing the economy as \u2018the center\u2019 of everything,\u201d said one of the officials who is based in eastern China\u2019s Zhejiang province.</span> \u201cReform will still be carried out, but it\u2019s taking a backseat to stability.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">At the same time, China\u2019s central bank moved in a way that could bolster its efforts to loosen its controls over the currency\u2014a step toward reform.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">While it didn\u2019t tell the International Monetary Fund or other outside groups about its plans, people close to the central bank say, it made the devaluation using a new mechanism that the PBOC believes will make the yuan more closely aligned with market forces.</span> The central bank also took pains to incorporate some previous IMF suggestions in the new mechanism, the people said.\n\nSpokespeople at the PBOC, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry and China\u2019s cabinet, the State Council, didn\u2019t respond to requests to comment.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The move to devalue the yuan comes as China\u2019s leaders are fighting a host of economic ills that could endanger their goal of achieving <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 7% annual</span> growth target for this year, which would be the lowest in a quarter century.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">They include weak factory output, slumping demand from both home and abroad, and persistent risks of falling prices that could make it harder for Chinese companies to pay off debt.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The currency step also followed unprecedented government efforts to prop up China\u2019s faltering stock market, which is jeopardizing Beijing\u2019s plan to restructure China\u2019s heavily indebted state-owned companies.\n\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">To shore up growth, China has cut interest rates four times and taken other measures to beef up bank lending since November.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Beijing has also freed up local government to issue bonds and the central bank provided financing to commercial banks to purchase those bonds.</span> Since early July, the PBOC has been offering credit to a government agency tasked with propping up falling Chinese shares.\n\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Increasingly they are also turning to their old playbook of ramping up fiscal spending on infrastructure and other government-backed projects\u2014an approach that spurred growth after <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2008 global</span> financial crisis but larded the world\u2019s No.<span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2 economy</span> with massive debt.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The central bank also is pumping billions of dollars of funds into China\u2019s policy banks to finance shanty-town renovations and other big-ticket projects.\n\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">China\u2019s cabinet, the State Council, made the decision to devalue the yuan in recent days amid gathering gloom over China\u2019s export sector, according to the officials and advisers.</span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">The latest official data shows Chinese exports in July fell a <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">surprising 8.3% from</span> a year earlier.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Exports for the first seven months of the year were <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 0.8% compared</span> with a year earlier.\n\n</span>At home, China moved to make sure the devaluation wasn\u2019t perceived as a desperate by the government. <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Ma Jun, chief economist at the central bank, said the devaluation was a \u201cone-off adjustment\u201d and it shouldn\u2019t be seen as the beginning of a weaker currency.</span> Also on Tuesday, the State Internet Information Office issued a directive to state media telling them not to play it up, according to people who received the notice.\n\nUp until now, China\u2019s central bank had been bolstering the yuan\u2019s value by selling large amounts of its dollar holdings to prevent the yuan from sliding against the dollar. It has repeatedly named maintaining the stability of the yuan\u2019s exchange rate as one of its top priorities.\n\nLong-time PBOC Gov.

class=\"red\">Devaluation comes as officials worry economy is slumping faster than Beijing anticipated\n\nUpdated Aug.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2015 9</span>:02 pm ET\n\nBEIJING\u2014Less than three months before China shocked markets with a surprise devaluation of its currency, a top Chinese exchange-rate official told a closed-door gathering that Beijing had no need for such a dramatic move.\n\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">\u201cDoes a deteriorating economy mean there must be a devaluation of the renminbi?\u201d said Yi Gang, the No.<span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2 official</span> at the People\u2019s Bank of China, using an alternative name for the currency.</span> \u201cNot necessarily.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">According to a transcript reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Yi told government officials, academics, businesspeople and investors at the <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 22 event</span> in Shanghai that China still had a \u201cvery large\u201d trade surplus that should support the currency.\n\n</span>Now, China has done a U-turn.\n\nOn Tuesday it pushed the yuan into the largest devaluation in its history, cutting its value against the dollar <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 1.9%.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The move roiled financial markets and set off worries that other central banks would follow suit.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">At home, it signals that Beijing is growing increasingly worried about its slowdown in economic growth.</span> Abroad, the move risks further chilling relations between Beijing and Washington ahead of President Xi Jinping\u2019s meeting with Barack Obama in the U.S. next month.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The currency move came as officials in China\u2019s Commerce Ministry, which oversees exports, and others expressed concern that the economy is slumping faster than China\u2019s leadership had anticipated, according to Chinese officials and government advisers.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Chinese officials also worried about this summer\u2019s confidence-shaking stock-market rout.</span> Overall, it suggests that China\u2019s leaders are looking for new ways to rev up growth as other methods look increasingly ineffective, raising the possibility of further and more dramatic efforts to come.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Tuesday\u2019s move shows Beijing is struggling to balance propping the economy with economic reform.</span> The Chinese leadership is shifting toward stabilizing growth rather than accelerating reforms such as opening the country up for freer cross-border capital flows, according to the Chinese officials and advisers to the government. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Behind the push is Mr. Xi, who they say over the past two months has repeatedly told local officials that \u201cmaintaining economic growth\u201d as the government\u2019s top priority for both near term and the next five years.\n\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">\u201cXi has more than once brought up stabilizing the economy as \u2018the center\u2019 of everything,\u201d said one of the officials who is based in eastern China\u2019s Zhejiang province.</span> \u201cReform will still be carried out, but it\u2019s taking a backseat to stability.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">At the same time, China\u2019s central bank moved in a way that could bolster its efforts to loosen its controls over the currency\u2014a step toward reform.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">While it didn\u2019t tell the International Monetary Fund or other outside groups about its plans, people close to the central bank say, it made the devaluation using a new mechanism that the PBOC believes will make the yuan more closely aligned with market forces.</span> The central bank also took pains to incorporate some previous IMF suggestions in the new mechanism, the people said.\n\nSpokespeople at the PBOC, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry and China\u2019s cabinet, the State Council, didn\u2019t respond to requests to comment.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The move to devalue the yuan comes as China\u2019s leaders are fighting a host of economic ills that could endanger their goal of achieving <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 7% annual</span> growth target for this year, which would be the lowest in a quarter century.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">They include weak factory output, slumping demand from both home and abroad, and persistent risks of falling prices that could make it harder for Chinese companies to pay off debt.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The currency step also followed unprecedented government efforts to prop up China\u2019s faltering stock market, which is jeopardizing Beijing\u2019s plan to restructure China\u2019s heavily indebted state-owned companies.\n\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">To shore up growth, China has cut interest rates four times and taken other measures to beef up bank lending since November.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Beijing has also freed up local government to issue bonds and the central bank provided financing to commercial banks to purchase those bonds.</span> Since early July, the PBOC has been offering credit to a government agency tasked with propping up falling Chinese shares.\n\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Increasingly they are also turning to their old playbook of ramping up fiscal spending on infrastructure and other government-backed projects\u2014an approach that spurred growth after <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2008 global</span> financial crisis but larded the world\u2019s No.<span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2 economy</span> with massive debt.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">The central bank also is pumping billions of dollars of funds into China\u2019s policy banks to finance shanty-town renovations and other big-ticket projects.\n\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">China\u2019s cabinet, the State Council, made the decision to devalue the yuan in recent days amid gathering gloom over China\u2019s export sector, according to the officials and advisers.</span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">The latest official data shows Chinese exports in July fell a <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">surprising 8.3% from</span> a year earlier.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Exports for the first seven months of the year were <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">down 0.8% compared</span> with a year earlier.\n\n</span>At home, China moved to make sure the devaluation wasn\u2019t perceived as a desperate by the government. <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Ma Jun, chief economist at the central bank, said the devaluation was a \u201cone-off adjustment\u201d and it shouldn\u2019t be seen as the beginning of a weaker currency.</span> Also on Tuesday, the State Internet Information Office issued a directive to state media telling them not to play it up, according to people who received the notice.\n\nUp until now, China\u2019s central bank had been bolstering the yuan\u2019s value by selling large amounts of its dollar holdings to prevent the yuan from sliding against the dollar. It has repeatedly named maintaining the stability of the yuan\u2019s exchange rate as one of its top priorities.\n\nLong-time PBOC Gov. Zhou Xiaochuan for years has push to liberalize the yuan and promote its global use. <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">By implementing the devaluation through a market-based mechanism, the PBOC hopes the

This whole thing is! We\u2019ve got all the damn cases,\u201d Mr. Trump yelled at Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, during a gathering of top aides in the Oval Office on Aug.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19.</span> \u201cI want to do what Mexico does. They don\u2019t give you a test till you get to the emergency room and you\u2019re vomiting.\u201d\nMexico\u2019s record in fighting the virus was hardly one for the United States to emulate. But the president had long seen testing not as a vital way to track and contain the pandemic but as a mechanism for making him look bad by driving up the number of known cases.\nAnd on that day he was especially furious after being informed by Dr. Francis S. Collins, the head of the National Institutes of Health, that it would be days before the government could give emergency approval to the use of convalescent plasma as a treatment, something Mr. Trump was eager to promote as a personal victory going into the Republican National Convention the following week.\n\u201cThey\u2019re Democrats! They\u2019re against me!\u201d he said, convinced that the government\u2019s top doctors and scientists were conspiring to undermine him. \u201cThey want to wait!\u201d\nThroughout late summer and fall, in the heat of a re-election campaign that he would go on to lose, and in the face of mounting evidence of a surge in infections and deaths far worse than in the spring, Mr. Trump\u2019s management of the crisis \u2014 unsteady, unscientific and colored by politics all year \u2014 was in effect reduced to a single question: What would it mean for him?\nThe result, according to interviews with more than two dozen current and former administration officials and others in contact with the White House, was a lose-lose situation. Mr. Trump not only ended up soundly defeated by Joseph R. Biden Jr., but missed his chance to show that he could rise to the moment in the final chapter of his presidency and meet the defining challenge of his tenure.\nEfforts by his aides to persuade him to promote mask wearing, among the simplest and most effective ways to curb the spread of the disease, were derailed by his conviction that his political base would rebel against anything that would smack of limiting their personal freedom. Even his own campaign\u2019s polling data to the contrary could not sway him.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">His explicit demand for a vaccine by Election Day \u2014 a push that came to a head in a contentious Oval Office meeting with top health aides in late September \u2014 became a misguided substitute for warning the nation that failure to adhere to social distancing and other mitigation efforts would contribute to a slow-rolling disaster this winter.\n</span>His concern? That the man he called \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d Biden, who was leading him in the polls, would get credit for a vaccine, not him.\nThe government\u2019s public health experts were all but silenced by the arrival in August of Dr. Scott W. Atlas, the Stanford professor of neuroradiology recruited after appearances on Fox News.\nWith Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the coordinator of the White House virus task force, losing influence and often on the road, Dr. Atlas became the sole doctor Mr. Trump listened to. His theories, some of which scientists viewed as bordering on the crackpot, were exactly what the president wanted to hear: The virus is overblown, the number of deaths is exaggerated, testing is overrated, lockdowns do more harm than good.\nAs the gap between politics and science grew, the infighting that Mr. Trump had allowed to plague the administration\u2019s response from the beginning only intensified.

Herman Cain, <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2012 Republican</span> presidential candidate, died from the coronavirus; the previous month he had attended a Trump rally without a mask.\nWith the pandemic defining the campaign despite Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to make it about law and order, Tony Fabrizio, the president\u2019s main pollster, came to the Oval Office for a meeting in the middle of the summer prepared to make a surprising case: that mask wearing was acceptable even among Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters.\nArrayed in front of the Resolute Desk, Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers listened as Mr. Fabrizio presented the numbers. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">According to his research, some of which was reported by The Washington Post, voters believed the pandemic was bad and getting worse, they were more concerned about getting sick than about the virus\u2019s effects on their personal financial situation, the president\u2019s approval rating on handling the pandemic had hit new lows and a little more than half the country did not think he was taking the situation seriously.\n</span>But what set off debate that day was Mr. Fabrizio\u2019s finding that more <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 70 percent</span> of voters in the states being targeted by the campaign supported mandatory mask wearing in public, at least indoors, including a majority of Republicans.\nMr. Kushner, who along with Hope Hicks, another top adviser, had been trying for months to convince Mr. Trump that masks could be portrayed as the key to regaining freedom to go safely to a restaurant or a sporting event, called embracing mask-wearing a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d\nMr. Kushner had some reason for optimism. Mr. Trump had agreed to wear one not long before for a visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, after finding one he believed he looked good in: dark blue, with a presidential seal.\nBut Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff \u2014 backed up by other aides including Stephen Miller \u2014 said the politics for Mr. Trump would be devastating.\n\u201cThe base will revolt,\u201d Mr. Meadows said, adding that he was not sure Mr. Trump could legally make it happen in any case.\nThat was all Mr. Trump needed to hear. \u201cI\u2019m not doing a mask mandate,\u201d he concluded.\nAside from when he was sick, he was rarely seen in a mask again.\nThe president had other opportunities to show leadership rather than put his political fortunes first.\nCovid-19 Vaccines \u203a\nAnswers to Your Vaccine Questions\nWith distribution of a coronavirus vaccine beginning in the U.S., here are answers to some questions you may be wondering about:\n- If I live in the U.S., when can I get the vaccine? While the exact order of vaccine recipients may vary by state, most will likely put medical workers and residents of long-term care facilities first. If you want to understand how this decision is getting made, this article will help.\n- When can I return to normal life after being vaccinated? Life will return to normal only when society as a whole gains enough protection against the coronavirus. Once countries authorize a vaccine, they\u2019ll only be able to vaccinate a few percent of their citizens at most in the first couple months. The unvaccinated majority will still remain vulnerable to getting infected. A growing number of coronavirus vaccines are showing robust protection against becoming sick. But it\u2019s also possible for people to spread the virus without even knowing they\u2019re infected because they experience only mild symptoms or none at all. Scientists don\u2019t yet know if the vaccines also block the transmission of the coronavirus. So for the time being, even vaccinated people will need to wear masks, avoid indoor crowds, and so on. Once enough people get vaccinated, it will become very difficult for the coronavirus to find vulnerable people to infect. Depending on how quickly we as a society achieve that goal, life might start approaching something like normal by the <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fall 2021.</span>\n- If I\u2019ve been vaccinated, do I still need to wear a mask? Yes, but not forever. Here\u2019s why. The coronavirus vaccines are injected deep into the muscles and stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies. This appears to be enough protection to keep the vaccinated person from getting ill. But what\u2019s not clear is whether it\u2019s possible for the virus to bloom in the nose \u2014 and be sneezed or breathed out to infect others \u2014 even as antibodies elsewhere in the body have mobilized to prevent the vaccinated person from getting sick. The vaccine clinical trials were designed to determine whether vaccinated people are protected from illness \u2014 not to find out whether they could still spread the coronavirus. Based on studies of flu vaccine and even patients infected with Covid-19, researchers have reason to be hopeful that vaccinated people won\u2019t spread the virus, but more research is needed. In the meantime, everyone \u2014 even vaccinated people \u2014 will need to think of themselves as possible silent spreaders and keep wearing a mask. Read more here.\n- Will it hurt? What are the side effects? The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine is delivered as a shot in the arm, like other typical vaccines. The injection into your arm won\u2019t feel different than any other vaccine, but the rate of short-lived side effects does appear higher than a flu shot. Tens of thousands of people have already received the vaccines, and none of them have reported any serious health problems. The side effects, which can resemble the symptoms of Covid-19, last about a day and appear more likely after the second dose. Early reports from vaccine trials suggest some people might need to take a day off from work because they feel lousy after receiving the second dose. In the Pfizer study, about half developed fatigue. Other side effects occurred in at <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 25 to</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 33 percent</span> of patients, sometimes more, including headaches, chills and muscle pain. While these experiences aren\u2019t pleasant, they are a good sign that your own immune system is mounting a potent response to the vaccine that will provide long-lasting immunity.\n- Will mRNA vaccines change my genes? No. The vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer use a genetic molecule to prime the immune system. That molecule, known as mRNA, is eventually destroyed by the body. The mRNA is packaged in an oily bubble that can fuse to a cell, allowing the molecule to slip in. The cell uses the mRNA to make proteins from the coronavirus, which can stimulate the immune system. At any moment, each of our cells may contain hundreds of thousands of mRNA molecules, which they produce in order to make proteins of their own. Once those proteins are made, our cells then shred the mRNA with special enzymes. The mRNA molecules our cells make can only survive a matter of minutes. The mRNA in vaccines is engineered to withstand the cell's enzymes a bit longer, so that the cells can make extra virus proteins and prompt a stronger immune response. But the mRNA can only last for a few days at most before they are destroyed.\nAfter he recovered from his bout with the virus, some of his top aides, including Mr. Kushner and Jason Miller, a senior campaign strategist, thought the illness offered an opportunity to demonstrate the kind of compassion and resolve about the pandemic\u2019s toll that Mr. Trump had so far failed to show.\nWhen Mr. Trump returned from the hospital, his communications aides, with the help of Ivanka Trump, his daughter, urged him to deliver a national address in which he would say: \u201cI had it. It was tough, it kicked my ass, but we\u2019re going to get through it.\u201d\nHe refused, choosing instead to address a boisterous campaign rally for himself from the balcony of the White House overlooking the South Lawn.\nMr. Trump never came around to the idea that he had a responsibility to be a role model, much less that his leadership role might require him to publicly acknowledge hard truths about the virus \u2014 or even to stop insisting that the issue was not a rampaging pandemic but too much testing.\nAlex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, briefed the president this fall on a Japanese study documenting the effectiveness of face masks, telling him: \u201cWe have the proof. They work.\u201d But the president resisted, criticizing Mr. Kushner for pushing them and again blaming too much testing \u2014 an area Mr. Kushner had been helping to oversee \u2014 for his problems.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to lose,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Kushner during debate preparations. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be your fault, because of the testing.\u201d\nMr. Morgenstern, the White House spokesman, said that exchange between the president and Mr. Kushner \u201cnever happened.\u201d\nMr. Azar, who was sometimes one of the few people wearing a mask at White House events, privately bemoaned what he called a political, anti-mask culture set by Mr. Trump. At White House Christmas parties, Mr. Azar asked maskless guests to back away from him.\nDivisions and Disagreements\nThe decision to run the government\u2019s response out of the West Wing was made in the early days of the pandemic. The idea was to break down barriers between disparate agencies, assemble public health expertise and encourage quick and coordinated decision-making.\nIt did not work out like that, and by fall the consequences were clear.\nMr. Trump had always tolerated if not encouraged clashes among subordinates, a tendency that in this case led only to policy paralysis, confusion about who was in charge and a lack of a clear, consistent message about how to reduce the risks from the pandemic.\nKeeping decision-making power close to him was another Trump trait, but in this case it also elevated the myriad choices facing the administration to the presidential level, bogging the process down in infighting, raising the political stakes and encouraging aides to jockey for favor with Mr. Trump.\nThe result at times was a systemwide failure that extended well beyond the president.\n\u201cWhat we needed was a coordinated response that involved contributions from multiple agencies,\u201d said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who was commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration for the first two years of the Trump administration.\n\u201cSomeone needed to pull that all together early,\u201d he said. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the job of the White House, either.</span> This needed to happen closer to the agencies. That didn\u2019t happen on testing, or on a whole lot of other things.\u201d\nThe relationship between Mr. Azar and Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, grew increasingly tense; by early November, they were communicating only by text and in meetings.\nDr. Birx had lost the clout she enjoyed early on in the crisis and spent much of the summer and fall on the road counseling governors and state health officials.\nMr. Meadows was at odds with almost everyone as he sought to impose the president\u2019s will on scientists and public health professionals. In conversations with top health officials, Mr. Meadows would rail against regulatory \u201cbureaucrats\u201d he thought were more interested in process than outcome.\nSome of the doctors on the task force, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, were reluctant to show up in person at the White House, worried that the disdain there for mask wearing and social distancing would leave them at risk of infection.\nVice President Mike Pence was nominally in charge of the task force but was so cautious about getting crosswise with Mr. Trump as they battled for re-election that, in public at least, he became nearly invisible.\nThe debates inside the White House increasingly revolved around Dr. Atlas, who had no formal training in infectious diseases but whose views \u2014 which Mr. Trump saw him deliver on Fox News \u2014 appealed to the president\u2019s belief that the crisis was overblown.\nHis arrival <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 1600 Pennsylvania</span> Avenue was itself something of a mystery. Some aides said he was discovered by Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary. Others said John McEntee, the president\u2019s personnel chief, had been Googling for a Trump-friendly doctor who would be loyal.\nMarc Short, Mr. Pence\u2019s chief of staff, opposed hiring Dr. Atlas. But once the president and his team brought him in, Mr. Short insisted that Dr. Atlas have a seat at the task force table, hoping to avoid having him become yet another internal \u2014 and destructive \u2014 critic.\nOnce inside, Dr. Atlas used the perch of a West Wing office to shape the response. During a meeting in early fall, Dr. Atlas asserted that college students were at no risk from the virus. We should let them go back to school, he said. It\u2019s not a problem.\nDr. Birx exploded. What aspect of the fact that you can be asymptomatic and still spread it do you not understand? she demanded. You might not die, but you can give it to somebody who can die from it. She was livid.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cYour strategy is literally going to cost us lives,\u201d she yelled at Dr. Atlas.</span> She attacked Dr. Atlas\u2019s ideas in daily emails she sent to senior officials. And she was mindful of a pact she had made with Dr. Hahn, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield even before Dr. Atlas came on board: They would stick together if one of them was fired for doing what they considered the right thing.\nHealth officials often had a hard time finding an audience in the upper reaches of the West Wing. In a mid-November task force meeting, they issued a dire warning to Mr. Meadows about the looming surge in cases set to devastate the country. Mr. Meadows demanded data to back up their claim.\nOne outcome of the meeting was a Nov.<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19 news</span> conference on the virus\u2019s dire threat, the first in many weeks. But while Mr. Pence, who led the briefing, often urged Americans to \u201cdo their part\u201d to slow the spread of the virus, he never directly challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s hesitancy on masks and social distancing. At the briefing, he said that \u201cdecision making at the local level\u201d was key, continuing a long pattern of the administration seeking to push responsibility to the states.\nMr. Azar had been cut out of key decision-making as early as February, when Mr. Pence took over the task force. Mr. Azar would complain to his associates that Mr. Pence\u2019s staff and task force members went around him to issue orders to his subordinates.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">On tenterhooks about his job status, Mr. Azar found an opening that offered a kind of redemption, steering his attention through the summer and fall to Operation Warp Speed, the government\u2019s effort to support rapid development of a vaccine, lavishing praise on Mr. Trump and crediting him for nearly every advance.\n</span>Behind the scenes, Mr. Azar portrayed Dr. Hahn to the White House as a flailing manager \u2014 a complaint he also voiced about Dr. Redfield. In late September, he told the White House he was willing to fire Dr. Hahn, according to officials familiar with the offer.\nFor their part, Dr. Hahn, Dr. Redfield, Dr. Birx and other senior health officials saw Mr. Azar as crushing the morale of the agencies he oversaw as he sought to escape blame for a worsening crisis and to strengthen his own image publicly and with the White House.\nHealth officials on the task force several times took their complaints about Mr. Azar to Mr. Pence\u2019s office, hoping for an intervention.\nCaitlin B. Oakley, a spokeswoman for Mr. Azar, said he had \u201calways stood up for balanced, scientific, public health information and insisted that science and data drive the decisions.\u201d\nOnce eager to visit the White House, Dr. Hahn became disillusioned with what he saw as its efforts to politicize the work of the Food and Drug Administration, and he eventually shied away from task force meetings, fearing his statements there would leak.\nIf there was a bureaucratic winner in this West Wing cage match, it was Dr. Atlas.\nHe told Mr. Trump that the right way to think about the virus was how much \u201cexcess mortality\u201d there was above what would have been expected without a pandemic.\nMr. Trump seized on the idea, often telling aides that the real number of dead was no more <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 10,000 people</span>.\nAs of Thursday,<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 342,577 Americans</span> had died from the pandemic.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Trump vs. Vaccine Regulators\nIn an Oval Office meeting with senior health officials on Sept.<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24,</span> the president made explicit what he had long implied: He wanted a vaccine before the election, according to three people who witnessed his demand.\n</span>Pfizer\u2019s chief executive had been encouraging the belief that the company could deliver initial results by late October. But Mr. Trump\u2019s aides tried in vain to make clear that they could not completely control the timing.\nDr. Fauci and Dr. Hahn reminded West Wing officials that a company\u2019s vaccine trial results were a \u201cblack box,\u201d impossible to see until an independent monitoring board revealed them. A vaccine that did not go through the usual, rigorous government approval process would be a \u201cPyrrhic victory,\u201d Mr. Azar told them. It would be a shot no one would take.\nDr. Moncef Slaoui, the scientific leader of Operation Warp Speed, said the president never asked him to deliver a vaccine on a specific timetable. But he said Mr. Trump sometimes complained in meetings that \u201cit was not going to happen before the election and it will be \u2018Sleepy Joe\u2019\u201d who would ultimately get credit.\nIn late October, science and regulations worked against Mr. Trump\u2019s waning hopes for pre-Election Day good news. At the F.D.A., scientists had refined the standards for authorizing a vaccine for emergency use. And at Pfizer, executives realized that the agency was unlikely to authorize its vaccine on the basis of so few Covid-19 cases among its clinical trial volunteers.\nThey decided to wait for more data, a delay of up to a week.\nWhen Pfizer announced on Nov.<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 9 </span>\u2014 two days after Mr. Biden clinched his victory \u2014 that its vaccine was a stunning success, Mr. Trump was furious. He lashed out at the company, Dr. Hahn and the F.D.A., accusing \u201cdeep state regulators\u201d of conspiring with Pfizer to slow approval until after the election.\nThe president\u2019s frustration with the pace of regulatory action would continue into December, as the F.D.A. went through a time-consuming process of evaluating Pfizer\u2019s data and then that of a second vaccine maker, Moderna.\nOn Dec.<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11,</span> Mr. Meadows exploded during a morning call with Dr. Hahn and Dr. Peter Marks, the agency\u2019s top vaccine regulator. He accused Dr. Hahn of mismanagement and suggested he resign, then slammed down the phone. That night, the F.D.A. authorized the Pfizer vaccine.\nIn the weeks that followed, Mr. Pence, Mr. Azar, Dr. Fauci and other health officials rolled up their sleeves to be vaccinated for the cameras.\nMr. Trump, who after contracting Covid-19 had declared himself immune, has not announced plans to be vaccinated.\nMichael D. Shear, Noah Weiland, Sharon LaFraniere and Mark Mazzetti reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. Katie Thomas contributed reporting from Chicago.\nCovid-19 Vaccines \u203a\nWords to Know About Vaccines\nConfused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated? Let us help:\n- Adverse event: A health problem that crops up in volunteers in a clinical trial of a vaccine or a drug. An adverse event isn\u2019t always caused by the treatment tested in the trial.\n- Antibody: A protein produced by the immune system that can attach to a pathogen such as the coronavirus and stop it from infecting cells.\n- Approval, licensure and emergency use authorization: Drugs, vaccines and medical devices cannot be sold in the United States without gaining approval from the Food and Drug Administration, also known as licensure. After a company submits the results of clinical trials to the F.D.A. for consideration, the agency decides whether the product is safe and effective, a process that generally takes many months. If the country is facing an emergency \u2014 like a pandemic \u2014 a company may apply instead for an emergency use authorization, which can be granted considerably faster.\n- Background rate: How often a health problem, known as an adverse event, arises in the general population. To determine if a vaccine or a drug is safe, researchers compare the rate of adverse events in a trial to the background rate.\n- Efficacy: The benefit that a vaccine provides compared to a placebo, as measured in a clinical trial. To test a coronavirus vaccine, for instance, researchers compare how many people in the vaccinated and placebo groups get Covid-19. Effectiveness, by contrast, is the benefit that a vaccine or a drug provides out in the real world. A vaccine's effectiveness may turn out to be lower or higher than its efficacy.\n- <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Phase 1,</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2,</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 3 trials</span>: Clinical trials typically take place in three stages. <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Phase 1 trials</span> usually involve a few dozen people and are designed to observe whether a vaccine or drug is safe. <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Phase 2 trials</span>, involving hundreds of people, allow researchers to try out different doses and gather more measurements about the vaccine\u2019s effects on the immune system. <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Phase 3 trials</span>, involving thousands or tens of thousands of volunteers, determine the safety and efficacy of the vaccine or drug by waiting to see how many people are protected from the disease it\u2019s designed to fight.\n- Placebo: A substance that has no therapeutic effect, often used in a clinical trial. To see if a vaccine can prevent Covid-19, for example, researchers may inject the vaccine into half of their volunteers, while the other half get a placebo of salt water. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">They can then compare how many people in each group get infected.\n- Post-market surveillance: The monitoring that takes place after a vaccine or drug has been approved and is regularly prescribed by doctors.</span> This surveillance typically confirms that the treatment is safe. On rare occasions, it detects side effects in certain groups of people that were missed during clinical trials.\n- Preclinical research: Studies that take place before the start of a clinical trial, typically involving experiments where a treatment is tested on cells or in animals.\n- Viral vector vaccines: A type of vaccine that uses a harmless virus to chauffeur immune-system-stimulating ingredients into the human body. Viral vectors are used in several experimental Covid-19 vaccines, including those developed by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson. Both of these companies are using a common cold virus called an adenovirus as their vector. The adenovirus carries coronavirus genes.\n- Trial protocol: A series of procedures to be carried out during a clinical trial.\nAdvertisement", "displayed_text": "<h3>Trump\u2019s Response to the Coronavirus Pandemic</h3>Advertisement\nSupported by\n\u2018Covid, Covid, Covid\u2019: In Trump\u2019s Final Chapter, a Failure to Rise to the Moment\nAs the U.S. confronted a new wave of infection and death through the summer and fall, the president\u2019s approach to the pandemic came down to a single question: What would it mean for him?\nWASHINGTON \u2014 It was a warm summer Wednesday, Election Day was looming and President Trump was even angrier than usual at the relentless focus on the coronavirus pandemic.\n\u201cYou\u2019re killing me! This whole thing is! We\u2019ve got all the damn cases,\u201d Mr. Trump yelled at Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, during a gathering of top aides in the Oval Office on Aug.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19.</span> \u201cI want to do what Mexico does. They don\u2019t give you a test till you get to the emergency room and you\u2019re vomiting.\u201d\nMexico\u2019s record in fighting the virus was hardly one for the United States to emulate. But the president had long seen testing not as a vital way to track and contain the pandemic but as a mechanism for making him look bad by driving up the number of known cases.\nAnd on that day he was especially furious after being informed by Dr. Francis S. Collins, the head of the National Institutes of Health, that it would be days before the government could give emergency approval to the use of convalescent plasma as a treatment, something Mr. Trump was eager to promote as a personal victory going into the Republican National Convention the following week.\n\u201cThey\u2019re Democrats! They\u2019re against me!\u201d he said, convinced that the government\u2019s top doctors and scientists were conspiring to undermine him. \u201cThey want to wait!\u201d\nThroughout late summer and fall, in the heat of a re-election campaign that he would go on to lose, and in the face of mounting evidence of a surge in infections and deaths far worse than in the spring, Mr. Trump\u2019s management of the crisis \u2014 unsteady, unscientific and colored by politics all year \u2014 was in effect reduced to a single question: What would it mean for him?\nThe result, according to interviews with more than two dozen current and former administration officials and others in contact with the White House, was a lose-lose situation. Mr. Trump not only ended up soundly defeated by Joseph R. Biden Jr., but missed his chance to show that he could rise to the moment in the final chapter of his presidency and meet the defining challenge of his tenure.\nEfforts by his aides to persuade him to promote mask wearing, among the simplest and most effective ways to curb the spread of the disease, were derailed by his conviction that his political base would rebel against anything that would smack of limiting their personal freedom. Even his own campaign\u2019s polling data to the contrary could not sway him.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">His explicit demand for a vaccine by Election Day \u2014 a push that came to a head in a contentious Oval Office meeting with top health aides in late September \u2014 became a misguided substitute for warning the nation that failure to adhere to social distancing and other mitigation efforts would contribute to a slow-rolling disaster this winter.\n</span>His concern? That the man he called \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d Biden, who was leading him in the polls, would get credit for a vaccine, not him.\nThe government\u2019s public health experts were all but silenced by the arrival in August of Dr. Scott W. Atlas, the Stanford professor of neuroradiology recruited after appearances on Fox News.\nWith Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the coordinator of the White House virus task force, losing influence and often on the road, Dr. Atlas became the sole doctor Mr. Trump listened to. His theories, some of which scientists viewed as bordering on the crackpot, were exactly what the president wanted to hear: The virus is overblown, the number of deaths is exaggerated, testing is overrated, lockdowns do more harm than good.\nAs the gap between politics and science grew, the infighting that Mr. Trump had allowed to plague the administration\u2019s response from the beginning only intensified. Threats of firings worsened the leadership vacuum as key figures undercut each other and distanced themselves from responsibility.\nThe administration had some positive stories to tell.

Herman Cain, <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2012 Republican</span> presidential candidate, died from the coronavirus; the previous month he had attended a Trump rally without a mask.\nWith the pandemic defining the campaign despite Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to make it about law and order, Tony Fabrizio, the president\u2019s main pollster, came to the Oval Office for a meeting in the middle of the summer prepared to make a surprising case: that mask wearing was acceptable even among Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters.\nArrayed in front of the Resolute Desk, Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers listened as Mr. Fabrizio presented the numbers. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">According to his research, some of which was reported by The Washington Post, voters believed the pandemic was bad and getting worse, they were more concerned about getting sick than about the virus\u2019s effects on their personal financial situation, the president\u2019s approval rating on handling the pandemic had hit new lows and a little more than half the country did not think he was taking the situation seriously.\n</span>But what set off debate that day was Mr. Fabrizio\u2019s finding that more <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 70 percent</span> of voters in the states being targeted by the campaign supported mandatory mask wearing in public, at least indoors, including a majority of Republicans.\nMr. Kushner, who along with Hope Hicks, another top adviser, had been trying for months to convince Mr. Trump that masks could be portrayed as the key to regaining freedom to go safely to a restaurant or a sporting event, called embracing mask-wearing a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d\nMr. Kushner had some reason for optimism. Mr. Trump had agreed to wear one not long before for a visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, after finding one he believed he looked good in: dark blue, with a presidential seal.\nBut Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff \u2014 backed up by other aides including Stephen Miller \u2014 said the politics for Mr. Trump would be devastating.\n\u201cThe base will revolt,\u201d Mr. Meadows said, adding that he was not sure Mr. Trump could legally make it happen in any case.\nThat was all Mr. Trump needed to hear. \u201cI\u2019m not doing a mask mandate,\u201d he concluded.\nAside from when he was sick, he was rarely seen in a mask again.\nThe president had other opportunities to show leadership rather than put his political fortunes first.\nCovid-19 Vaccines \u203a\nAnswers to Your Vaccine Questions\nWith distribution of a coronavirus vaccine beginning in the U.S., here are answers to some questions you may be wondering about:\n- If I live in the U.S., when can I get the vaccine? While the exact order of vaccine recipients may vary by state, most will likely put medical workers and residents of long-term care facilities first. If you want to understand how this decision is getting made, this article will help.\n- When can I return to normal life after being vaccinated? Life will return to normal only when society as a whole gains enough protection against the coronavirus. Once countries authorize a vaccine, they\u2019ll only be able to vaccinate a few percent of their citizens at most in the first couple months. The unvaccinated majority will still remain vulnerable to getting infected. A growing number of coronavirus vaccines are showing robust protection against becoming sick. But it\u2019s also possible for people to spread the virus without even knowing they\u2019re infected because they experience only mild symptoms or none at all. Scientists don\u2019t yet know if the vaccines also block the transmission of the coronavirus. So for the time being, even vaccinated people will need to wear masks, avoid indoor crowds, and so on. Once enough people get vaccinated, it will become very difficult for the coronavirus to find vulnerable people to infect. Depending on how quickly we as a society achieve that goal, life might start approaching something like normal by the <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fall 2021.</span>\n- If I\u2019ve been vaccinated, do I still need to wear a mask? Yes, but not forever. Here\u2019s why. The coronavirus vaccines are injected deep into the muscles and stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies. This appears to be enough protection to keep the vaccinated person from getting ill. But what\u2019s not clear is whether it\u2019s possible for the virus to bloom in the nose \u2014 and be sneezed or breathed out to infect others \u2014 even as antibodies elsewhere in the body have mobilized to prevent the vaccinated person from getting sick. The vaccine clinical trials were designed to determine whether vaccinated people are protected from illness \u2014 not to find out whether they could still spread the coronavirus. Based on studies of flu vaccine and even patients infected with Covid-19, researchers have reason to be hopeful that vaccinated people won\u2019t spread the virus, but more research is needed. In the meantime, everyone \u2014 even vaccinated people \u2014 will need to think of themselves as possible silent spreaders and keep wearing a mask. Read more here.\n- Will it hurt? What are the side effects? The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine is delivered as a shot in the arm, like other typical vaccines. The injection into your arm won\u2019t feel different than any other vaccine, but the rate of short-lived side effects does appear higher than a flu shot. Tens of thousands of people have already received the vaccines, and none of them have reported any serious health problems. The side effects, which can resemble the symptoms of Covid-19, last about a day and appear more likely after the second dose. Early reports from vaccine trials suggest some people might need to take a day off from work because they feel lousy after receiving the second dose. In the Pfizer study, about half developed fatigue. Other side effects occurred in at <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 25 to</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 33 percent</span> of patients, sometimes more, including headaches, chills and muscle pain. While these experiences aren\u2019t pleasant, they are a good sign that your own immune system is mounting a potent response to the vaccine that will provide long-lasting immunity.\n- Will mRNA vaccines change my genes? No. The vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer use a genetic molecule to prime the immune system. That molecule, known as mRNA, is eventually destroyed by the body. The mRNA is packaged in an oily bubble that can fuse to a cell, allowing the molecule to slip in. The cell uses the mRNA to make proteins from the coronavirus, which can stimulate the immune system. At any moment, each of our cells may contain hundreds of thousands of mRNA molecules, which they produce in order to make proteins of their own. Once those proteins are made, our cells then shred the mRNA with special enzymes. The mRNA molecules our cells make can only survive a matter of minutes. The mRNA in vaccines is engineered to withstand the cell's enzymes a bit longer, so that the cells can make extra virus proteins and prompt a stronger immune response. But the mRNA can only last for a few days at most before they are destroyed.\nAfter he recovered from his bout with the virus, some of his top aides, including Mr. Kushner and Jason Miller, a senior campaign strategist, thought the illness offered an opportunity to demonstrate the kind of compassion and resolve about the pandemic\u2019s toll that Mr. Trump had so far failed to show.\nWhen Mr. Trump returned from the hospital, his communications aides, with the help of Ivanka Trump, his daughter, urged him to deliver a national address in which he would say: \u201cI had it. It was tough, it kicked my ass, but we\u2019re going to get through it.\u201d\nHe refused, choosing instead to address a boisterous campaign rally for himself from the balcony of the White House overlooking the South Lawn.\nMr. Trump never came around to the idea that he had a responsibility to be a role model, much less that his leadership role might require him to publicly acknowledge hard truths about the virus \u2014 or even to stop insisting that the issue was not a rampaging pandemic but too much testing.\nAlex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, briefed the president this fall on a Japanese study documenting the effectiveness of face masks, telling him: \u201cWe have the proof. They work.\u201d But the president resisted, criticizing Mr. Kushner for pushing them and again blaming too much testing \u2014 an area Mr. Kushner had been helping to oversee \u2014 for his problems.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to lose,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Kushner during debate preparations. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be your fault, because of the testing.\u201d\nMr. Morgenstern, the White House spokesman, said that exchange between the president and Mr. Kushner \u201cnever happened.\u201d\nMr. Azar, who was sometimes one of the few people wearing a mask at White House events, privately bemoaned what he called a political, anti-mask culture set by Mr. Trump. At White House Christmas parties, Mr. Azar asked maskless guests to back away from him.\nDivisions and Disagreements\nThe decision to run the government\u2019s response out of the West Wing was made in the early days of the pandemic. The idea was to break down barriers between disparate agencies, assemble public health expertise and encourage quick and coordinated decision-making.\nIt did not work out like that, and by fall the consequences were clear.\nMr. Trump had always tolerated if not encouraged clashes among subordinates, a tendency that in this case led only to policy paralysis, confusion about who was in charge and a lack of a clear, consistent message about how to reduce the risks from the pandemic.\nKeeping decision-making power close to him was another Trump trait, but in this case it also elevated the myriad choices facing the administration to the presidential level, bogging the process down in infighting, raising the political stakes and encouraging aides to jockey for favor with Mr. Trump.\nThe result at times was a systemwide failure that extended well beyond the president.\n\u201cWhat we needed was a coordinated response that involved contributions from multiple agencies,\u201d said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who was commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration for the first two years of the Trump administration.\n\u201cSomeone needed to pull that all together early,\u201d he said. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the job of the White House, either.</span> This needed to happen closer to the agencies. That didn\u2019t happen on testing, or on a whole lot of other things.\u201d\nThe relationship between Mr. Azar and Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, grew increasingly tense; by early November, they were communicating only by text and in meetings.\nDr. Birx had lost the clout she enjoyed early on in the crisis and spent much of the summer and fall on the road counseling governors and state health officials.\nMr. Meadows was at odds with almost everyone as he sought to impose the president\u2019s will on scientists and public health professionals. In conversations with top health officials, Mr. Meadows would rail against regulatory \u201cbureaucrats\u201d he thought were more interested in process than outcome.\nSome of the doctors on the task force, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, were reluctant to show up in person at the White House, worried that the disdain there for mask wearing and social distancing would leave them at risk of infection.\nVice President Mike Pence was nominally in charge of the task force but was so cautious about getting crosswise with Mr. Trump as they battled for re-election that, in public at least, he became nearly invisible.\nThe debates inside the White House increasingly revolved around Dr. Atlas, who had no formal training in infectious diseases but whose views \u2014 which Mr. Trump saw him deliver on Fox News \u2014 appealed to the president\u2019s belief that the crisis was overblown.\nHis arrival <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 1600 Pennsylvania</span> Avenue was itself something of a mystery. Some aides said he was discovered by Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary. Others said John McEntee, the president\u2019s personnel chief, had been Googling for a Trump-friendly doctor who would be loyal.\nMarc Short, Mr. Pence\u2019s chief of staff, opposed hiring Dr. Atlas. But once the president and his team brought him in, Mr. Short insisted that Dr. Atlas have a seat at the task force table, hoping to avoid having him become yet another internal \u2014 and destructive \u2014 critic.\nOnce inside, Dr. Atlas used the perch of a West Wing office to shape the response. During a meeting in early fall, Dr. Atlas asserted that college students were at no risk from the virus. We should let them go back to school, he said. It\u2019s not a problem.\nDr. Birx exploded. What aspect of the fact that you can be asymptomatic and still spread it do you not understand? she demanded. You might not die, but you can give it to somebody who can die from it. She was livid.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cYour strategy is literally going to cost us lives,\u201d she yelled at Dr. Atlas.</span> She attacked Dr. Atlas\u2019s ideas in daily emails she sent to senior officials. And she was mindful of a pact she had made with Dr. Hahn, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield even before Dr. Atlas came on board: They would stick together if one of them was fired for doing what they considered the right thing.\nHealth officials often had a hard time finding an audience in the upper reaches of the West Wing. In a mid-November task force meeting, they issued a dire warning to Mr. Meadows about the looming surge in cases set to devastate the country. Mr. Meadows demanded data to back up their claim.\nOne outcome of the meeting was a Nov.<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 19 news</span> conference on the virus\u2019s dire threat, the first in many weeks. But while Mr. Pence, who led the briefing, often urged Americans to \u201cdo their part\u201d to slow the spread of the virus, he never directly challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s hesitancy on masks and social distancing. At the briefing, he said that \u201cdecision making at the local level\u201d was key, continuing a long pattern of the administration seeking to push responsibility to the states.\nMr. Azar had been cut out of key decision-making as early as February, when Mr. Pence took over the task force. Mr. Azar would complain to his associates that Mr. Pence\u2019s staff and task force members went around him to issue orders to his subordinates.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">On tenterhooks about his job status, Mr. Azar found an opening that offered a kind of redemption, steering his attention through the summer and fall to Operation Warp Speed, the government\u2019s effort to support rapid development of a vaccine, lavishing praise on Mr. Trump and crediting him for nearly every advance.\n</span>Behind the scenes, Mr. Azar portrayed Dr. Hahn to the White House as a flailing manager \u2014 a complaint he also voiced about Dr. Redfield. In late September, he told the White House he was willing to fire Dr. Hahn, according to officials familiar with the offer.\nFor their part, Dr. Hahn, Dr. Redfield, Dr. Birx and other senior health officials saw Mr. Azar as crushing the morale of the agencies he oversaw as he sought to escape blame for a worsening crisis and to strengthen his own image publicly and with the White House.\nHealth officials on the task force several times took their complaints about Mr. Azar to Mr. Pence\u2019s office, hoping for an intervention.\nCaitlin B. Oakley, a spokeswoman for Mr. Azar, said he had \u201calways stood up for balanced, scientific, public health information and insisted that science and data drive the decisions.\u201d\nOnce eager to visit the White House, Dr. Hahn became disillusioned with what he saw as its efforts to politicize the work of the Food and Drug Administration, and he eventually shied away from task force meetings, fearing his statements there would leak.\nIf there was a bureaucratic winner in this West Wing cage match, it was Dr. Atlas.\nHe told Mr. Trump that the right way to think about the virus was how much \u201cexcess mortality\u201d there was above what would have been expected without a pandemic.\nMr. Trump seized on the idea, often telling aides that the real number of dead was no more <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 10,000 people</span>.\nAs of Thursday,<span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 342,577 Americans</span> had died from the pandemic.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Trump vs. Vaccine Regulators\nIn an Oval Office meeting with senior health officials on Sept.<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24,</span> the president made explicit what he had long implied: He wanted a vaccine before the election, according to three people who witnessed his demand.\n</span>Pfizer\u2019s chief executive had been encouraging the belief that the company could deliver initial results by late October. But Mr. Trump\u2019s aides tried in vain to make clear that they could not completely control the timing.\nDr. Fauci and Dr. Hahn reminded West Wing officials that a company\u2019s vaccine trial results were a \u201cblack box,\u201d impossible to see until an independent monitoring board revealed them. A vaccine that did not go through the usual, rigorous government approval process would be a \u201cPyrrhic victory,\u201d Mr. Azar told them. It would be a shot no one would take.\nDr. Moncef Slaoui, the scientific leader of Operation Warp Speed, said the president never asked him to deliver a vaccine on a specific timetable. But he said Mr. Trump sometimes complained in meetings that \u201cit was not going to happen before the election and it will be \u2018Sleepy Joe\u2019\u201d who would ultimately get credit.\nIn late October, science and regulations worked against Mr. Trump\u2019s waning hopes for pre-Election Day good news. At the F.D.A., scientists had refined the standards for authorizing a vaccine for emergency use. And at Pfizer, executives realized that the agency was unlikely to authorize its vaccine on the basis of so few Covid-19 cases among its clinical trial volunteers.\nThey decided to wait for more data, a delay of up to a week.\nWhen Pfizer announced on Nov.<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 9 </span>\u2014 two days after Mr. Biden clinched his victory \u2014 that its vaccine was a stunning success, Mr. Trump was furious. He lashed out at the company, Dr. Hahn and the F.D.A., accusing \u201cdeep state regulators\u201d of conspiring with Pfizer to slow approval until after the election.\nThe president\u2019s frustration with the pace of regulatory action would continue into December, as the F.D.A. went through a time-consuming process of evaluating Pfizer\u2019s data and then that of a second vaccine maker, Moderna.\nOn Dec.<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11,</span> Mr. Meadows exploded during a morning call with Dr. Hahn and Dr. Peter Marks, the agency\u2019s top vaccine regulator. He accused Dr. Hahn of mismanagement and suggested he resign, then slammed down the phone. That night, the F.D.A. authorized the Pfizer vaccine.\nIn the weeks that followed, Mr. Pence, Mr. Azar, Dr. Fauci and other health officials rolled up their sleeves to be vaccinated for the cameras.\nMr. Trump, who after contracting Covid-19 had declared himself immune, has not announced plans to be vaccinated.\nMichael D. Shear, Noah Weiland, Sharon LaFraniere and Mark Mazzetti reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. Katie Thomas contributed reporting from Chicago.\nCovid-19 Vaccines \u203a\nWords to Know About Vaccines\nConfused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated? Let us help:\n- Adverse event: A health problem that crops up in volunteers in a clinical trial of a vaccine or a drug. An adverse event isn\u2019t always caused by the treatment tested in the trial.\n- Antibody: A protein produced by the immune system that can attach to a pathogen such as the coronavirus and stop it from infecting cells.\n- Approval, licensure and emergency use authorization: Drugs, vaccines and medical devices cannot be sold in the United States without gaining approval from the Food and Drug Administration, also known as licensure. After a company submits the results of clinical trials to the F.D.A. for consideration, the agency decides whether the product is safe and effective, a process that generally takes many months. If the country is facing an emergency \u2014 like a pandemic \u2014 a company may apply instead for an emergency use authorization, which can be granted considerably faster.\n- Background rate: How often a health problem, known as an adverse event, arises in the general population. To determine if a vaccine or a drug is safe, researchers compare the rate of adverse events in a trial to the background rate.\n- Efficacy: The benefit that a vaccine provides compared to a placebo, as measured in a clinical trial. To test a coronavirus vaccine, for instance, researchers compare how many people in the vaccinated and placebo groups get Covid-19. Effectiveness, by contrast, is the benefit that a vaccine or a drug provides out in the real world. A vaccine's effectiveness may turn out to be lower or higher than its efficacy.\n- <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Phase 1,</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2,</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 3 trials</span>: Clinical trials typically take place in three stages. <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Phase 1 trials</span> usually involve a few dozen people and are designed to observe whether a vaccine or drug is safe. <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Phase 2 trials</span>, involving hundreds of people, allow researchers to try out different doses and gather more measurements about the vaccine\u2019s effects on the immune system. <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Phase 3 trials</span>, involving thousands or tens of thousands of volunteers, determine the safety and efficacy of the vaccine or drug by waiting to see how many people are protected from the disease it\u2019s designed to fight.\n- Placebo: A substance that has no therapeutic effect, often used in a clinical trial. To see if a vaccine can prevent Covid-19, for example, researchers may inject the vaccine into half of their volunteers, while the other half get a placebo of salt water. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">They can then compare how many people in each group get infected.\n- Post-market surveillance: The monitoring that takes place after a vaccine or drug has been approved and is regularly prescribed by doctors.</span> This surveillance typically confirms that the treatment is safe. On rare occasions, it detects side effects in certain groups of people that were missed during clinical trials.\n- Preclinical research: Studies that take place before the start of a clinical trial, typically involving experiments where a treatment is tested on cells or in animals.\n- Viral vector vaccines: A type of vaccine that uses a harmless virus to chauffeur immune-system-stimulating ingredients into the human body. Viral vectors are used in several experimental Covid-19 vaccines, including those developed by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson. Both of these companies are using a common cold virus called an adenovirus as their vector. The adenovirus carries coronavirus genes.\n- Trial protocol: A series of procedures to be carried out during a clinical trial.\nAdvertisement"}, "58401": {"id": "58401", "text": "<h3>Gasoline Prices Shoot Up at Fastest Rate on Record</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Gasoline Prices Shoot Up at Fastest Rate on Record\nPrices have soared across the U.S., but filling up isn\u2019t so pricey historically after taking inflation and fuel-economy improvements into account\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">As summer driving season approaches, average prices for regular gasoline have been at record highs the past two weeks after going up <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 11 straight</span> weeks.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Prices <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reached $4.32 a</span> gallon on <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 14,</span> according to weekly figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.</span> They <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">were $4.24 this</span> past week, according to figures released Monday.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Those prices at the pump don\u2019t factor in inflation, though, which reached its highest rate in four decades last month.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Inflation-adjusted gas prices are at their highest levels <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2014 and</span> similar to what U.S. drivers saw in the early 1980s.\n</span>To Read the Full Story", "displayed_text": "<h3>Gasoline Prices Shoot Up at Fastest Rate on Record</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Gasoline Prices Shoot Up at Fastest Rate on Record\nPrices have soared across the U.S., but filling up isn\u2019t so pricey historically after taking inflation and fuel-economy improvements into account\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">As summer driving season approaches, average prices for regular gasoline have been at record highs the past two weeks after going up <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 11 straight</span> weeks.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Prices <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reached $4.32 a</span> gallon on <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 14,</span> according to weekly figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.</span> They <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">were $4.24 this</span> past week, according to figures released Monday.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Those prices at the pump don\u2019t factor in inflation, though, which reached its highest rate in four decades last month.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Inflation-adjusted gas prices are at their highest levels <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2014 and</span> similar to what U.S. drivers saw in the early 1980s.\n</span>To Read the Full Story"}, "54624": {"id": "54624", "text": "<h3>Goldman Sachs Drops the Velvet Rope for Savers</h3>Wall Street firm is offering savings accounts and certificates of deposit from the website of its banking arm\n\nUpdated <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 25,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016 7</span>:56 pm ET\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., GS -0.42%decrease; red down pointing triangle adviser to billionaires and the world\u2019s largest companies, will now accept your couch-cushion money.\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The financial firm most synonymous with Wall Street started offering savings accounts and certificates of deposit this month from the website of its banking arm, GS Bank.</span> The firm will accept new customers with as little to save <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as $1,</span> though they will <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">need $500 to</span> open a certificate of deposit.\n\nThe move was set in motion last August, when Goldman signed a deal to buy the online-deposit platform of GE Capital Bank.

The veteran Hollywood producer faces sexual-harassment accusations from dozens of women, including allegations of rape and sexual assault.\n\nMr. Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said he has met with federal prosecutors in Manhattan \u201cin an attempt to dissuade them from proceeding\u201d and will continue to meet with them in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cMr. Weinstein has always maintained that he has never engaged in nonconsensual sexual acts,\u201d he said.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Manhattan federal prosecutors had already been investigating possible fraud connected to financial transactions arranged by Mr. Weinstein for a charity auction, but the broadening of the probe to include possible sex crimes occurred in recent months, some of the people familiar with the matter said.\n\n</span>It is rare for federal prosecutors to review individual sexual assault allegations, which are typically handled by local authorities, according to legal experts. Federal sex crimes charges are more commonly used in sex-trafficking and child-exploitation cases.\n\nLocal authorities in Manhattan and Los Angeles have opened investigations into Mr. Weinstein since media reports in <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2017 detailed</span> several instances of sexual harassment by him.\n\nThe federal investigation into Mr. Weinstein is happening as the continuing probe by local authorities in New York has been marked by tensions between police and the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cHow much longer can they let it linger?\u201d said Michael Bock, who investigated Mr. Weinstein as a supervisor for the New York Police Department\u2019s Special Victims Division before retiring last year. \u201cWe believe he should be arrested.\u201d\n\nTwo NYPD officials said the NYPD is prepared to arrest Mr. Weinstein and is awaiting the green light from Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., whose office has been criticized by some law-enforcement officials and women\u2019s groups for its decision not to charge Mr. Weinstein <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015 for</span> a sexual-assault allegation brought against him by an Italian model.\n\nIn response to criticism over Mr. Vance\u2019s handling of <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2015 case</span>, Danny Frost, a spokesman for Mr. Vance\u2019s office, said in March: \u201cPolice evaluate arrests based on probable cause, whereas prosecutors must make sure they can prove to a jury that every element of a criminal statute was violated beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014a much higher standard.\u201d\n\nIn March, Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed the New York attorney general to review how Mr. Vance\u2019s office and the NYPD handled <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2015 investigation</span>. Mr. Vance, in a letter to the governor, called the review \u201can unwarranted intrusion by an elected executive into a charging decision by an independent prosecutor.\u201d\n\nMr. Frost said this week that the district attorney\u2019s current investigation into Mr. Weinstein is in \u201can advanced stage.\u201d\n\nAs part of the investigation, the NYPD reviewed a rape allegation by actress Paz de la Huerta, according to people familiar with the investigation. Ms. de la Huerta has accused Mr. Weinstein of forcing himself on her in her Tribeca apartment <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010.</span> She said it wasn\u2019t consensual.\n\nMr. Weinstein has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex.\n\nThe sex-crimes investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan is separate and independent from the inquiry by Mr. Vance\u2019s office, people familiar with the matter said. It is unclear which allegations the U.S. attorney\u2019s office is reviewing.\n\nTo charge Mr. Weinstein with a federal sex crime, prosecutors face a high bar. They would likely have to show interstate activity, such as evidence that Mr. Weinstein enticed a woman to cross state lines under false pretenses with the intention of committing a sex crime against her, legal experts said.\n\nSex-crime cases are among the toughest for both state and federal prosecutors to prove, former prosecutors said, as the victims\u2019 recollection and credibility can be impacted by the trauma of the incident.\n\n\u201cOften, there isn\u2019t a contemporaneous record of the assault taking place,\u201d said Jeffrey Brown, who oversaw sex-crimes investigations as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and is now in private practice. \u201cIn any prosecution, the lack of that kind of corroborating evidence can make the victim\u2019s in-court testimony vulnerable to challenge.\u201d\n\nIn one advantage for federal prosecutors, federal rules of evidence are more expansive in allowing proof of other sexual assaults to show a defendant\u2019s propensity for a sex crime.\n\nThe limited ability to do that at the state level played out during the first sexual-assault trial against entertainer Bill Cosby, which ended in a mistrial after a judge allowed prosecutors to call two women to testify that they had been assaulted by Mr. Cosby. Prosecutors had sought to have more than a dozen women take the stand.\n\nMr. Cosby was convicted last month after a second trial, where six accusers were allowed to testify. Mr. Cosby\u2019s lawyer has said he plans to appeal.\n\nWrite to Nicole Hong at nicole.hong@wsj.com and Zolan Kanno-Youngs at Zolan.

The veteran Hollywood producer faces sexual-harassment accusations from dozens of women, including allegations of rape and sexual assault.\n\nMr. Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said he has met with federal prosecutors in Manhattan \u201cin an attempt to dissuade them from proceeding\u201d and will continue to meet with them in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cMr. Weinstein has always maintained that he has never engaged in nonconsensual sexual acts,\u201d he said.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Manhattan federal prosecutors had already been investigating possible fraud connected to financial transactions arranged by Mr. Weinstein for a charity auction, but the broadening of the probe to include possible sex crimes occurred in recent months, some of the people familiar with the matter said.\n\n</span>It is rare for federal prosecutors to review individual sexual assault allegations, which are typically handled by local authorities, according to legal experts. Federal sex crimes charges are more commonly used in sex-trafficking and child-exploitation cases.\n\nLocal authorities in Manhattan and Los Angeles have opened investigations into Mr. Weinstein since media reports in <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2017 detailed</span> several instances of sexual harassment by him.\n\nThe federal investigation into Mr. Weinstein is happening as the continuing probe by local authorities in New York has been marked by tensions between police and the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cHow much longer can they let it linger?\u201d said Michael Bock, who investigated Mr. Weinstein as a supervisor for the New York Police Department\u2019s Special Victims Division before retiring last year. \u201cWe believe he should be arrested.\u201d\n\nTwo NYPD officials said the NYPD is prepared to arrest Mr. Weinstein and is awaiting the green light from Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., whose office has been criticized by some law-enforcement officials and women\u2019s groups for its decision not to charge Mr. Weinstein <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015 for</span> a sexual-assault allegation brought against him by an Italian model.\n\nIn response to criticism over Mr. Vance\u2019s handling of <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2015 case</span>, Danny Frost, a spokesman for Mr. Vance\u2019s office, said in March: \u201cPolice evaluate arrests based on probable cause, whereas prosecutors must make sure they can prove to a jury that every element of a criminal statute was violated beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014a much higher standard.\u201d\n\nIn March, Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed the New York attorney general to review how Mr. Vance\u2019s office and the NYPD handled <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2015 investigation</span>. Mr. Vance, in a letter to the governor, called the review \u201can unwarranted intrusion by an elected executive into a charging decision by an independent prosecutor.\u201d\n\nMr. Frost said this week that the district attorney\u2019s current investigation into Mr. Weinstein is in \u201can advanced stage.\u201d\n\nAs part of the investigation, the NYPD reviewed a rape allegation by actress Paz de la Huerta, according to people familiar with the investigation. Ms. de la Huerta has accused Mr. Weinstein of forcing himself on her in her Tribeca apartment <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010.</span> She said it wasn\u2019t consensual.\n\nMr. Weinstein has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex.\n\nThe sex-crimes investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan is separate and independent from the inquiry by Mr. Vance\u2019s office, people familiar with the matter said. It is unclear which allegations the U.S. attorney\u2019s office is reviewing.\n\nTo charge Mr. Weinstein with a federal sex crime, prosecutors face a high bar. They would likely have to show interstate activity, such as evidence that Mr. Weinstein enticed a woman to cross state lines under false pretenses with the intention of committing a sex crime against her, legal experts said.\n\nSex-crime cases are among the toughest for both state and federal prosecutors to prove, former prosecutors said, as the victims\u2019 recollection and credibility can be impacted by the trauma of the incident.\n\n\u201cOften, there isn\u2019t a contemporaneous record of the assault taking place,\u201d said Jeffrey Brown, who oversaw sex-crimes investigations as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and is now in private practice. \u201cIn any prosecution, the lack of that kind of corroborating evidence can make the victim\u2019s in-court testimony vulnerable to challenge.\u201d\n\nIn one advantage for federal prosecutors, federal rules of evidence are more expansive in allowing proof of other sexual assaults to show a defendant\u2019s propensity for a sex crime.\n\nThe limited ability to do that at the state level played out during the first sexual-assault trial against entertainer Bill Cosby, which ended in a mistrial after a judge allowed prosecutors to call two women to testify that they had been assaulted by Mr. Cosby. Prosecutors had sought to have more than a dozen women take the stand.\n\nMr. Cosby was convicted last month after a second trial, where six accusers were allowed to testify. Mr. Cosby\u2019s lawyer has said he plans to appeal.\n\nWrite to Nicole Hong at nicole.hong@wsj.com and Zolan Kanno-Youngs at Zolan.

What did they miss? <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">And was that a reflection of something not happening at the New York Fed on the desk or elsewhere?\u201d\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">In an interview, Mr. Williams rejected the idea that the central bank was behind the curve in responding to the market volatility.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The New York Fed followed a \u201cconsistent approach of assessment, coming up very quickly with an appropriate plan, and executing that,\u201d he said.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis is really the Fed at its best.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The Fed\u2019s approach will be tested Monday, when the third quarter ends and banks may refrain from overnight lending in order to show strong balance sheets.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Reduced lending could put pressure on the repo market and create more volatility.\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The New York Fed said it plans to keep injecting funds through Oct.<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 10 and</span> has increased the sizes of these injections in recent days.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Mr. Williams and his colleagues must also solve the mystery behind the money-market dysfunction: Why did banks, seemingly flush with reserves, choose not to lend as rising repo rates created a quick profit opportunity?</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Officials are studying the role of new regulations and other postcrisis market structure issues.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Regardless of the cause, such volatility isn\u2019t good\u2014in stressed conditions, it could force hedge funds and others that rely heavily on short-term loans to dump assets, disrupting markets and impairing the flow of credit to the economy.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">The New York Fed, in a castle-like fortress two blocks from Wall Street, serves as the central bank\u2019s nexus between the financial markets and the economy.</span> It provides the U.S. government\u2019s real-time eyes and ears on trillions of dollars that flow through global markets daily. <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Its staff played critical roles designing rescue programs and monitoring banks when broken credit markets sent the financial system to the brink of collapse <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2007 and</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2009.</span>\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Mr. Williams took the helm in <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2018 after</span> a career as an economist at the Washington-based board of governors and then the San Francisco Fed, where he became president <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2011.</span></span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">His predecessor in New York, William Dudley, had overseen markets operations after serving as chief economist at Goldman Sachs .\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Mr. Williams co-wrote seminal research on policy-setting rules and models to estimate a theoretical neutral level of interest that neither spurs nor slows growth, something economists call \u201cr-star.\u201d\n</span>A punk and classic-rock music aficionado, he sprinkled speeches with lyrical references to Led Zeppelin and The Clash.

Return index to its worst monthly loss since <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">November 2008 and</span> deepening a yearslong rout that few observers expect to moderate.\n\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The index, which tracks a basket of commodities, fell to its lowest level <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2002 on</span></span> Friday, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices.</span> All but one of <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 24 index</span> components posted losses for July.\n\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Investors in commodity markets are confronting threats from a slowdown in China, an anemic global economy and the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates from the Federal Reserve.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The dollar, which has rallied this summer on expectations of tighter U.S. monetary policy, is also pressuring prices of raw materials, which are traded in the U.S. currency and become more expensive for buyers in other countries when the buck rallies.\n\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Hopes that China has seen the worst of its economic slowdown were spurned after the country\u2019s stock market dived in July, notching its worst month in six years.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">China is the largest consumer of raw materials, and investors now fear that problems in its equity market will reverberate across the economy in coming months as cash-strapped consumers abort purchases of new cars, homes and other goods.\n\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Europe is battling to stave off another economic downturn.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">A weaker euro hasn\u2019t buoyed exports from the region, and growth and inflation remain stubbornly low.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">This dims any prospect of higher demand for raw materials from the region.\n\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Commodity prices are also under pressure as supply of many raw materials runs ahead of global demand.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Companies that grow soybeans or mine for coal outside the U.S. are opting to keep up production because weaker domestic currencies keep their costs low, while a stronger dollar means they bring homxxe larger profits despite falling prices.\n\n</span>Against this backdrop, many investors are choosing to give commodities the cold shoulder.\n\n\u201cFolks are being very cautious in terms of where they want to apply their capital, we\u2019ve seen that in commodities...it just continues to be an area that people want to avoid,\u201d said Dan Farley, chief investment

Morgan.\n\n</span>\u201cThe rest of the world\u2019s tone is improving while the U.S. is decelerating, and the dollar is reflecting that,\u201d said Mark McCormick, North American head of foreign-exchange strategy at TD Securities.\n\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Some investors believe the dollar\u2019s performance this year could spell the end for the bull market in the greenback.</span> Periods of dollar strength have typically lasted for around seven years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at this pivotal moment now where we\u2019re in the midst of a major turn lower in the dollar,\u201d said Bilal Hafeez, head of foreign-exchange strategy for Nomura Securities in London.\n\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Alessio de Longis, a portfolio manager at OppenheimerFunds, entered the year betting on a broadly stronger dollar but now expects the dollar to trade sideways this year.\n\n</span>\u201cThe growth momentum in the U.S. is fading,\u201d Mr. de Longis said. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">\u201cWithout a reinvigoration of tax reform, which doesn\u2019t seem likely this year, the dollar bull market is probably over.\u201d\n\nHedge funds and other speculative investors built up more <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $28 billion</span> in bullish bets on the dollar at the end of last year, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.</span> As of <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 27,</span> bullish bets on the dollar had shrunk to a <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">net $2.7 billion</span>.\n\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Not everyone has lost confidence in a strong dollar: James Athey, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, still expects the dollar to rise against developed-market currencies such as the yen in the months ahead.\n\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe dollar has suffered greatly,\u201d said Mr. Athey, who thinks dollar investors are too pessimistic about the Fed\u2019s interest-rate path.\n\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe think the U.S. economy is still the most robust,\u201d he added.\n\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">A weaker U.S. currency could help support the recent recovery in corporate profits, which grew at the fastest pace in nearly six years in the first quarter of the year.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">A falling dollar makes U.S. multinationals\u2019 exports more competitive abroad.\n\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">A weaker dollar also would relieve pressure on emerging-market nations by making their dollar-denominated debts easier to service and relieving downward pressure on their currencies.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Since many developing countries are also commodities producers, a weaker dollar helps these economies because it makes their materials cheaper for nondollar buyers.\n\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Even in Europe, where exports to the U.S. have become more expensive as a result of the euro\u2019<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 8.6% rise</span> against the dollar this year, signs of growth slowly picking up could mean European companies are better able to withstand a weakening dollar than in previous years.</span> The benchmark Stoxx <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Europe 600 index</span> has <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rallied 5% this</span> year.\n\nWrite to Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.

Records reviewed by The Post show that at <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 44 public</span> and private universities in the United States work with outside consulting companies to collect and analyze data on prospective students, by tracking their Web activity or formulating predictive scores to measure each student\u2019s likelihood of enrolling.\nThe practices may raise a hidden barrier to a college education for underprivileged students. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">While colleges have used data for many years to decide which regions and high schools to target their recruiting, the latest tools let administrators build rich profiles on individual students and quickly determine whether they have enough family income to help the school meet revenue goals.\n</span>The Post identified colleges with data operations by reviewing the customer lists of two top admissions consulting firms: Capture Higher Ed and Ruffalo Noel Levitz. The Post interviewed admissions staffers <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 23 colleges</span>, examined contracts and emails obtained <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 26 public</span> universities through open-records laws, and used a Web privacy tool to confirm the presence of Capture Higher Ed\u2019s tracking software on the websites <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 33 universities</span>.\nRecords and interviews show that colleges are building vast repositories of data on prospective students \u2014 scanning test scores, Zip codes, high school transcripts, academic interests, Web browsing histories, ethnic backgrounds and household incomes for clues about which students would make the best candidates for admission. At many schools, this data is used to give students a score <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 1 to</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 100,</span> which determines how much attention colleges pay them in the recruiting process.\nScoring and tracking are popular at schools that are struggling to survive. Faced with shrinking sources of funding and growing competition for high school graduates, cash-strapped colleges are experimenting with new ways to identify and attract students who can afford to pay tuition, said Lloyd Thacker, a former admissions counselor and founder of the Education Conservancy, a nonprofit research group.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cAn admission dean is more and more a businessperson charged with bringing in revenue,\u201d Thacker said.</span> \u201cThe more fearful they are about survival, the more willing they are to embrace new strategies.\u201d\nAdmissions consulting companies charge schools tens of thousands of dollars a year to collect and analyze the data of millions of students. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">In emails reviewed by The Post, employees of Louisville-based Capture Higher Ed urged school administrators to hand over all data they felt comfortable sharing.\n</span>\u201cWe love data, so the more the merrier,\u201d one of Capture\u2019s consultants wrote in <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2017 email</span> to the admissions director at UW-Stout.\nCapture Higher Ed spokesman Jim Davidson said the company helps schools provide relevant information to students who have chosen to receive that information. Students can opt out of Web tracking by contacting schools directly, he said.\nDoug Mell, a spokesman for UW-Stout, said in an email that the school used Capture\u2019s Web tracking for a one-year trial and did not renew the contract this year. The female student who was tracked last year voluntarily gave the school her background information when she applied, he said. She enrolled in the school last year.\nConsultants are expanding their influence on college campuses. Ruffalo Noel Levitz, based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has hired the top admissions officers at more than two dozen universities \u2014 including Vanderbilt, Creighton and Marquette \u2014 to do paid consulting work on the side, according to interviews and records. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Some university officials received compensation from Ruffalo Noel Levitz at the same time that their schools were paying customers of the company \u2014 raising questions about potential conflicts of interest, Thacker said.\n</span>The vast majority of universities reviewed by The Post do not tell students the schools are collecting their information. In a review of the online privacy policies of <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">all 33 schools</span> using Web tracking software, only three disclosed the purpose of the tracking. The <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">other 30 omitted</span> any explanation or did not explain the full extent or purpose of their tracking.\nThe State University of New York\u2019s College of Environmental Science and Forestry said in its online privacy policy that it \u201cdoes not use cookies.\u201d However, a representative from the school said in an email that the school does use Capture Higher Ed\u2019s tracking cookies to show relevant pop-up ads to students but deletes the cookies from its databases \u201cwithin four hours.\u201d\nSome privacy experts say colleges\u2019 failure to disclose the full extent of how they share data with outside consultants may violate the spirit if not the letter of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, a federal law protecting the privacy of student education records at schools that receive federal education funds. FERPA generally requires that schools ask for students\u2019 permission before sharing their personal data with any outside parties.\nRather than getting permission, some schools have classified the consulting companies as \u201cschool officials,\u201d a legal designation that exempts them from FERPA if certain conditions are met.\nZachary Greenberg, a program officer at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a student advocacy group, said colleges that do this risk undermining one of the goals of FERPA \u2014 to make the management of records more transparent. \u201cStudents deserve to know where their information is going,\u201d Greenberg said.\nThe Education Department can suspend all federal funding to any school it finds in violation of FERPA but has never imposed that penalty in <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 45 years</span> since the law was created. The agency has other enforcement measures and works with offenders to voluntarily come into compliance, said Angela Morabito, a spokeswoman for the Education Department. She declined to say whether colleges may be violating the law by sharing data with consulting companies.\nMany schools do not give students the ability to opt out of data collection. Jacquelyn Malcolm, chief information officer at the State University of New York\u2019s Buffalo State College, said that if prospective students do not want their Web browsing tracked, they should not visit her school\u2019s website.\n\u201cYou have a choice of not interacting at all,\u201d Malcolm said in an interview, adding that applicants can get information by calling the school, visiting its social media accounts or visiting other websites with information about different colleges.\nIn an email, a spokesman for SUNY Buffalo State later said that the school is exploring new ways to inform students about its privacy practices and that anyone can request not to be tracked by sending an email directly to Malcolm.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Filtering recruits with socioeconomic data\nData tools appeal to schools that are trying to increase revenue by recruiting students who can afford to pay tuition.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">At Mississippi State University, a state school with more <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 18,000 undergraduates</span>, administrators use data to filter a large number of potential applicants down to a select pool of recruits who are a good fit for the school\u2019s academic programs and do not need much financial aid.\n</span>Each year, Mississippi State buys data on thousands of high school students from testing firms including the College Board, which owns the SAT, said John Dickerson, assistant vice president for enrollment. These students all gave permission to have their data shared by checking a box when they took the SAT. The nonprofit testing company says on its website that it licenses the names and data of each student <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 47 cents</span> apiece.\nNext, Mississippi State shares its list of prospects with Ruffalo Noel Levitz, which uses a formula to assign each one a score. According to Dickerson, the formula for out-of-state students gives the most weight (30 percent) to a student\u2019s desired major; someone choosing agriculture or veterinary sciences, areas where the school is strong, will score higher than a student who wants to major in music. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The formula also weighs their distance from campus (7.9 percent), income level (7.2 percent) and consumer purchasing behavior (6.8 percent), among other factors.\n</span>The formula is an example of predictive analytics, a field of computer science that attempts to predict the likelihood of future events by looking for patterns in data. Similar to software that tries to predict what movies or music someone will like, these formulas attempt to guess which students are a good match for a college based on how many attributes they have in common with students who previously enrolled in the school.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">A predictive formula may also be adjusted to favor the types of people a college wants more of, such as ethnic minorities or students of financial means.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Mississippi State uses socioeconomic data in its admissions algorithm to recruit more high-income students from outside the state, Dickerson said.</span> Like many public universities, Mississippi State has ramped up out-of-state recruiting because those students pay higher tuition. The university <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">drew 42 percent</span> of its freshmen from out of state <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018,</span> up <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 26 percent</span> a decade earlier, federal data shows.\n\u201cFrom a practical standpoint,\u201d Dickerson said, \u201cyou would want to know if folks have an ability to pay.\u201d\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The vast majority of Mississippi State students still receive some form of financial aid, and the school says it does not use financial information to determine who gets an offer of admission.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">However, focusing recruiting resources on higher-income students means lower-income students may receive less encouragement to apply for college.\n</span>Shaquilla Wordlaw, a junior at Mississippi State, said she thinks it is a good idea for college recruiters to use more data to target messages to the right students. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">But Wordlaw, who is from Starkville, where Mississippi State is based, says the school should not discriminate against students based on their income.\n</span>\u201cThey\u2019re choosing those who are a part of the upper class rather than middle or lower, because they want money,\u201d Wordlaw said. \u201cThey\u2019re not focused on the education they are providing.\u201d\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Consulting companies may estimate a student\u2019s financial position by checking their Zip codes against U.S. Census data for estimated household incomes in that area.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Ruffalo Noel Levitz and Capture Higher Ed also buy information from third-party data brokers, which gather consumer data from public and private databases on property holders, magazine subscribers and supermarket loyalty-card members.\n</span>Some schools say data analysis can help them find students who might not have applied in the first place. George Mason University, in Northern Virginia, uses data analysis tools to look for nontraditional prospects who might have working-class parents or be the first in their family to go to college, said David Burge, the school\u2019s vice president for enrollment management.\nConsulting companies woo college officials\nAs they pursue student data, colleges have embraced an industry of consultants.\nHundreds of school administrators filled the ballroom of a Nashville convention center in late July for a keynote speech by Sumit Nijhawan, a former tech executive who became CEO of Ruffalo Noel Levitz last year. He paced before a large screen and discussed how data is helping colleges tailor their pitch to individual students, similar to how tech companies such as Spotify and Netflix surface music and videos based on the user, he said. \u201cUsually the solution to problems is lurking somewhere around in data,\u201d Nijhawan told the crowd. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of data in higher ed \u2014 no doubt about that.\u201d\nThe three-day conference, replete with lunch buffets, PowerPoint presentations and free coffee mugs with company logos, was an example of how consulting companies are trying to win over school officials as they negotiate for larger contracts and more access to student data.\nAt <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 30 admissions</span> officers have taken part in Ruffalo Noel Levitz\u2019s associate consulting program over the past decade, according to interviews and records posted on the company\u2019s website. Emails reviewed by The Post show the program is helping Ruffalo Noel Levitz build closer ties to campus decision-makers.\nCecilia Castellano, vice provost of strategic enrollment planning at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, became an associate consultant for Ruffalo Noel Levitz around the same time her school signed a three-year,<span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $48,000 contract</span>, which was obtained by The Post through a public-records request. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Castellano, who was listed as the \u201cprimary contact\u201d on that business deal in <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2016,</span> received emails from Ruffalo Noel Levitz a few days later, asking her to sign up for a \u201cnew associate training workshop\u201d later in the year.\n</span>In an email to Castellano the same year, Ruffalo Noel Levitz asked her to help pitch <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $13,590</span>-per-person certification program to potential customers. \u201cPlease encourage the teams on your client campuses to consider the program,\u201d the email said.\nDave Kielmeyer, a university spokesman, said Castellano attended the consultant training <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016 and</span> has since done two paid consulting projects for the company. She got approval from the school, which did not see the work as a conflict, Kielmeyer said. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Castellano \u201chas a role in hiring vendors,\u201d he said, but the school\u2019s provost or chief financial officer must approve consulting contracts.\n</span>Admissions officers at Vanderbilt, Creighton and Marquette universities say that they have disclosed their consulting roles with their colleges and are careful not to work with competing schools. Nijhawan, the Ruffalo Noel Levitz CEO, said in an interview that the program is aimed at helping school administrators \u201cshare knowledge across the industry.\u201d\nMatching \u2018cookies\u2019 to student identities\nSome of the same technologies that big companies use to track users and show ads to consumers are gaining traction in college admissions. One example is Capture Higher Ed\u2019s behavioral tracking service, which relies on cookies to record every click students make when they visit a university website.\nEach visitor to the university site gets a cookie, which sends Capture information including that person\u2019s Internet protocol address, the type of computer and browser they are using, what time of day they visited the site and which pages within the site they clicked on, according to Patrick Jackson, chief technology officer for digital privacy firm Disconnect, who reviewed college websites on behalf of The Post.\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Every time that person returns to the site, Capture learns more information about them, such as their interest in athletics or the amount of time they spend on financial aid pages, according to promotional videos on the company\u2019s website.\n</span>Initially, the cookies identify each visitor by the IP address, a unique code associated with a computer\u2019s Internet connection, but Capture also offers software tools to match the cookie data with people\u2019s real identities, according to the company\u2019s promotional videos. Colleges do this by sending marketing emails to thousands of prospective students, inviting them to click on a hyperlink inside the message for more information about a particular topic, according to the videos.\nWhen a student clicks on the link, Capture learns which email address is associated with which IP address, connecting the student\u2019s real identity to the college\u2019s snapshot of the student\u2019s Web browsing history, Capture executives said in one of the videos.\n\u201cWe are embedding links in every email,\u201d Billy Pierce, then director of undergraduate admission at the University of Toledo, a Capture customer, said onstage at a college admissions conference <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016.</span> \u201cYou want more of the identified visitors coming to your website because those are the kids that you have their name, their address, their email, sometimes their phone number \u2014 any information you have in your system now gets tied to their behavior,\u201d Pierce said at the conference, a video of which was posted to YouTube.\nMeghan Cunningham, a spokeswoman for the University of Toledo, said the school uses Capture\u2019s software code on its website and in some \u2014 not all \u2014 of its marketing emails in an effort to give students information relevant to them. In an email, Pierce added that students choose to give their names and contact information to the school.\nAdmissions officers say behavioral tracking helps them serve students in the application process. When a college sees that a qualified student is serious about applying based on the student\u2019s Web behavior, it can dedicate more staffers to follow up.\n\u201cAn admissions counselor may only have an hour in a given day to make contact with prospective students,\u201d Chrissy Holliday, vice president of enrollment at Colorado State University at Pueblo \u2014 a Capture Higher Ed client \u2014 said in an email. \u201cThe web data allows the counselor to know which students are currently most engaged and might benefit most from that contact.\u201d\nBut Web tracking may unfairly provide an advantage to students with better access to technology, said Bradley Shear, a Maryland lawyer who has pushed for better regulation of students\u2019 online privacy. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">A low-income student may be a strong academic candidate but receive less attention from recruiters because the student does not own a smartphone or have high-speed Internet access at home, he said.\n</span>\u201cI don\u2019t think the algorithm should run the admissions department,\u201d Shear said.", "displayed_text": "<h3>Student tracking, secret scores: How college admissions offices rank prospects before they apply</h3>The admissions officer also received a link to a private profile of the student, listing <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">all 27 pages</span> she had viewed on the school\u2019s website and how long she spent on each one. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">A map on this page showed her geographical location, and an \u201caffinity index\u201d estimated her level of interest in attending the school.</span> Her score <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 91 out</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 100 predicted</span> she was highly likely to accept an admission offer from UW-Stout, the records showed.\nColleges are collecting more data about prospective students than ever before \u2014 part of an effort, administrators say, to make better predictions about which students are the most likely to apply, accept an offer and enroll.

The female student who was tracked last year voluntarily gave the school her background information when she applied, he said. She enrolled in the school last year.\nConsultants are expanding their influence on college campuses. Ruffalo Noel Levitz, based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has hired the top admissions officers at more than two dozen universities \u2014 including Vanderbilt, Creighton and Marquette \u2014 to do paid consulting work on the side, according to interviews and records. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Some university officials received compensation from Ruffalo Noel Levitz at the same time that their schools were paying customers of the company \u2014 raising questions about potential conflicts of interest, Thacker said.\n</span>The vast majority of universities reviewed by The Post do not tell students the schools are collecting their information. In a review of the online privacy policies of <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">all 33 schools</span> using Web tracking software, only three disclosed the purpose of the tracking. The <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">other 30 omitted</span> any explanation or did not explain the full extent or purpose of their tracking.\nThe State University of New York\u2019s College of Environmental Science and Forestry said in its online privacy policy that it \u201cdoes not use cookies.\u201d However, a representative from the school said in an email that the school does use Capture Higher Ed\u2019s tracking cookies to show relevant pop-up ads to students but deletes the cookies from its databases \u201cwithin four hours.\u201d\nSome privacy experts say colleges\u2019 failure to disclose the full extent of how they share data with outside consultants may violate the spirit if not the letter of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, a federal law protecting the privacy of student education records at schools that receive federal education funds. FERPA generally requires that schools ask for students\u2019 permission before sharing their personal data with any outside parties.\nRather than getting permission, some schools have classified the consulting companies as \u201cschool officials,\u201d a legal designation that exempts them from FERPA if certain conditions are met.\nZachary Greenberg, a program officer at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a student advocacy group, said colleges that do this risk undermining one of the goals of FERPA \u2014 to make the management of records more transparent. \u201cStudents deserve to know where their information is going,\u201d Greenberg said.\nThe Education Department can suspend all federal funding to any school it finds in violation of FERPA but has never imposed that penalty in <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 45 years</span> since the law was created. The agency has other enforcement measures and works with offenders to voluntarily come into compliance, said Angela Morabito, a spokeswoman for the Education Department. She declined to say whether colleges may be violating the law by sharing data with consulting companies.\nMany schools do not give students the ability to opt out of data collection. Jacquelyn Malcolm, chief information officer at the State University of New York\u2019s Buffalo State College, said that if prospective students do not want their Web browsing tracked, they should not visit her school\u2019s website.\n\u201cYou have a choice of not interacting at all,\u201d Malcolm said in an interview, adding that applicants can get information by calling the school, visiting its social media accounts or visiting other websites with information about different colleges.\nIn an email, a spokesman for SUNY Buffalo State later said that the school is exploring new ways to inform students about its privacy practices and that anyone can request not to be tracked by sending an email directly to Malcolm.\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Filtering recruits with socioeconomic data\nData tools appeal to schools that are trying to increase revenue by recruiting students who can afford to pay tuition.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">At Mississippi State University, a state school with more <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 18,000 undergraduates</span>, administrators use data to filter a large number of potential applicants down to a select pool of recruits who are a good fit for the school\u2019s academic programs and do not need much financial aid.\n</span>Each year, Mississippi State buys data on thousands of high school students from testing firms including the College Board, which owns the SAT, said John Dickerson, assistant vice president for enrollment. These students all gave permission to have their data shared by checking a box when they took the SAT. The nonprofit testing company says on its website that it licenses the names and data of each student <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 47 cents</span> apiece.\nNext, Mississippi State shares its list of prospects with Ruffalo Noel Levitz, which uses a formula to assign each one a score. According to Dickerson, the formula for out-of-state students gives the most weight (30 percent) to a student\u2019s desired major; someone choosing agriculture or veterinary sciences, areas where the school is strong, will score higher than a student who wants to major in music. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The formula also weighs their distance from campus (7.9 percent), income level (7.2 percent) and consumer purchasing behavior (6.8 percent), among other factors.\n</span>The formula is an example of predictive analytics, a field of computer science that attempts to predict the likelihood of future events by looking for patterns in data. Similar to software that tries to predict what movies or music someone will like, these formulas attempt to guess which students are a good match for a college based on how many attributes they have in common with students who previously enrolled in the school.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">A predictive formula may also be adjusted to favor the types of people a college wants more of, such as ethnic minorities or students of financial means.\n</span><span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Mississippi State uses socioeconomic data in its admissions algorithm to recruit more high-income students from outside the state, Dickerson said.</span> Like many public universities, Mississippi State has ramped up out-of-state recruiting because those students pay higher tuition. The university <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">drew 42 percent</span> of its freshmen from out of state <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018,</span> up <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 26 percent</span> a decade earlier, federal data shows.\n\u201cFrom a practical standpoint,\u201d Dickerson said, \u201cyou would want to know if folks have an ability to pay.\u201d\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The vast majority of Mississippi State students still receive some form of financial aid, and the school says it does not use financial information to determine who gets an offer of admission.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">However, focusing recruiting resources on higher-income students means lower-income students may receive less encouragement to apply for college.\n</span>Shaquilla Wordlaw, a junior at Mississippi State, said she thinks it is a good idea for college recruiters to use more data to target messages to the right students. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">But Wordlaw, who is from Starkville, where Mississippi State is based, says the school should not discriminate against students based on their income.\n</span>\u201cThey\u2019re choosing those who are a part of the upper class rather than middle or lower, because they want money,\u201d Wordlaw said. \u201cThey\u2019re not focused on the education they are providing.\u201d\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Consulting companies may estimate a student\u2019s financial position by checking their Zip codes against U.S. Census data for estimated household incomes in that area.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Ruffalo Noel Levitz and Capture Higher Ed also buy information from third-party data brokers, which gather consumer data from public and private databases on property holders, magazine subscribers and supermarket loyalty-card members.\n</span>Some schools say data analysis can help them find students who might not have applied in the first place. George Mason University, in Northern Virginia, uses data analysis tools to look for nontraditional prospects who might have working-class parents or be the first in their family to go to college, said David Burge, the school\u2019s vice president for enrollment management.\nConsulting companies woo college officials\nAs they pursue student data, colleges have embraced an industry of consultants.\nHundreds of school administrators filled the ballroom of a Nashville convention center in late July for a keynote speech by Sumit Nijhawan, a former tech executive who became CEO of Ruffalo Noel Levitz last year. He paced before a large screen and discussed how data is helping colleges tailor their pitch to individual students, similar to how tech companies such as Spotify and Netflix surface music and videos based on the user, he said. \u201cUsually the solution to problems is lurking somewhere around in data,\u201d Nijhawan told the crowd. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of data in higher ed \u2014 no doubt about that.\u201d\nThe three-day conference, replete with lunch buffets, PowerPoint presentations and free coffee mugs with company logos, was an example of how consulting companies are trying to win over school officials as they negotiate for larger contracts and more access to student data.\nAt <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 30 admissions</span> officers have taken part in Ruffalo Noel Levitz\u2019s associate consulting program over the past decade, according to interviews and records posted on the company\u2019s website. Emails reviewed by The Post show the program is helping Ruffalo Noel Levitz build closer ties to campus decision-makers.\nCecilia Castellano, vice provost of strategic enrollment planning at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, became an associate consultant for Ruffalo Noel Levitz around the same time her school signed a three-year,<span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $48,000 contract</span>, which was obtained by The Post through a public-records request. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Castellano, who was listed as the \u201cprimary contact\u201d on that business deal in <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2016,</span> received emails from Ruffalo Noel Levitz a few days later, asking her to sign up for a \u201cnew associate training workshop\u201d later in the year.\n</span>In an email to Castellano the same year, Ruffalo Noel Levitz asked her to help pitch <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $13,590</span>-per-person certification program to potential customers. \u201cPlease encourage the teams on your client campuses to consider the program,\u201d the email said.\nDave Kielmeyer, a university spokesman, said Castellano attended the consultant training <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016 and</span> has since done two paid consulting projects for the company. She got approval from the school, which did not see the work as a conflict, Kielmeyer said. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Castellano \u201chas a role in hiring vendors,\u201d he said, but the school\u2019s provost or chief financial officer must approve consulting contracts.\n</span>Admissions officers at Vanderbilt, Creighton and Marquette universities say that they have disclosed their consulting roles with their colleges and are careful not to work with competing schools. Nijhawan, the Ruffalo Noel Levitz CEO, said in an interview that the program is aimed at helping school administrators \u201cshare knowledge across the industry.\u201d\nMatching \u2018cookies\u2019 to student identities\nSome of the same technologies that big companies use to track users and show ads to consumers are gaining traction in college admissions. One example is Capture Higher Ed\u2019s behavioral tracking service, which relies on cookies to record every click students make when they visit a university website.\nEach visitor to the university site gets a cookie, which sends Capture information including that person\u2019s Internet protocol address, the type of computer and browser they are using, what time of day they visited the site and which pages within the site they clicked on, according to Patrick Jackson, chief technology officer for digital privacy firm Disconnect, who reviewed college websites on behalf of The Post.\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Every time that person returns to the site, Capture learns more information about them, such as their interest in athletics or the amount of time they spend on financial aid pages, according to promotional videos on the company\u2019s website.\n</span>Initially, the cookies identify each visitor by the IP address, a unique code associated with a computer\u2019s Internet connection, but Capture also offers software tools to match the cookie data with people\u2019s real identities, according to the company\u2019s promotional videos. Colleges do this by sending marketing emails to thousands of prospective students, inviting them to click on a hyperlink inside the message for more information about a particular topic, according to the videos.\nWhen a student clicks on the link, Capture learns which email address is associated with which IP address, connecting the student\u2019s real identity to the college\u2019s snapshot of the student\u2019s Web browsing history, Capture executives said in one of the videos.\n\u201cWe are embedding links in every email,\u201d Billy Pierce, then director of undergraduate admission at the University of Toledo, a Capture customer, said onstage at a college admissions conference <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016.</span> \u201cYou want more of the identified visitors coming to your website because those are the kids that you have their name, their address, their email, sometimes their phone number \u2014 any information you have in your system now gets tied to their behavior,\u201d Pierce said at the conference, a video of which was posted to YouTube.\nMeghan Cunningham, a spokeswoman for the University of Toledo, said the school uses Capture\u2019s software code on its website and in some \u2014 not all \u2014 of its marketing emails in an effort to give students information relevant to them. In an email, Pierce added that students choose to give their names and contact information to the school.\nAdmissions officers say behavioral tracking helps them serve students in the application process. When a college sees that a qualified student is serious about applying based on the student\u2019s Web behavior, it can dedicate more staffers to follow up.\n\u201cAn admissions counselor may only have an hour in a given day to make contact with prospective students,\u201d Chrissy Holliday, vice president of enrollment at Colorado State University at Pueblo \u2014 a Capture Higher Ed client \u2014 said in an email. \u201cThe web data allows the counselor to know which students are currently most engaged and might benefit most from that contact.\u201d\nBut Web tracking may unfairly provide an advantage to students with better access to technology, said Bradley Shear, a Maryland lawyer who has pushed for better regulation of students\u2019 online privacy. <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">A low-income student may be a strong academic candidate but receive less attention from recruiters because the student does not own a smartphone or have high-speed Internet access at home, he said.\n</span>\u201cI don\u2019t think the algorithm should run the admissions department,\u201d Shear said."}, "72739": {"id": "72739", "text": "<h3>Fed Leaves Policy Rate Unchanged, Lowers Outlook for Increases</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Fed Leaves Policy Rate Unchanged, Lowers Outlook for Increases\nFed officials project lower rate path <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 and</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2018,</span> and in the longer run\nWASHINGTON\u2014The Federal Reserve held its benchmark lending rate steady on Wednesday and officials lowered projections of how much they expect to raise short-term interest rates in the coming years, signs that persistently slow economic growth and low inflation are forcing the central bank to rethink how fast it can move rates higher.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe are quite uncertain about where rates are heading in the longer term,\u201d Chairwoman Janet Yellen said at a press conference following the Fed\u2019s two-day policy meeting.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">New projections show officials expect the fed-funds rate to rise <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 0.875% by</span> the end <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2016,</span> according to the median projection <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 17 officials</span>.</span> Their forecasts imply they see two rate increases this year.

decision to leave rates unchanged, and \u201cclearly could have consequences\u201d for economic and global financial markets, the Fed chief added.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf it does so, it could have consequences in turn for the U.S. economic outlook that would be a factor in deciding on the appropriate path of policy,\u201d Ms. Yellen said of the so-called Brexit vote, set for <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 23.</span>\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">In their official policy statement released after the meeting, Fed officials repeated the refrain they\u2019ve been using all year that they expect \u201ceconomic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The central bank in December pushed its benchmark interest rate up from near zero to <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 0.25% and</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 0.5%.</span>\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">So far, the economy and financial markets haven\u2019t cooperated with plans to keep moving rates up.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Early in the year, market turbulence and slow growth in economic output gave officials pause.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Growth appears to have picked up and markets settled down, but now hiring and expected inflation are a cause of concern for officials, a mixed backdrop making them reluctant to act.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed while growth in economic activity appears to have picked up,\u201d the Fed said.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">While consumer spending has strengthened, business investment has been soft.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Meantime, market indicators of expected inflation have declined, the Fed said, a development Ms. Yellen noted earlier this month was of some concern.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">The tone of the Fed\u2019s official statement and projections suggest officials will need to see a quick turnaround in economic data and evidence of market resilience if they are to move promptly.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">The Fed indicated its views about risks to the economy haven\u2019t shifted much since April.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">As they said then, officials said they would \u201cclosely monitor\u201d inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.</span> That isn\u2019t a strong endorsement of the outlook. <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">At moments of more confidence, as in December when the Fed raised short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point, the Fed said risks to the economy were balanced.\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">The Fed slightly reduced its estimate for how much economic output will expand this year, shifting its March projection <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2.2% output</span> growth <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 2%.</span></span></span> It also nudged down <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its 2017 growth</span> projection by one tenth of one percent <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 2%.</span></span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">At the same time it nudged up its inflation projection for the year <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 1.4% from</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.2%,</span> but held most of its other projections steady.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">The combination of relatively stable economic projections and a lower interest rate outlook suggest officials are slowly coming to the conclusion that the economy simply can\u2019t bear very high interest rates, even to achieve mediocre growth and low inflation.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Ms. Yellen has said headwinds are holding back the economy.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">It might be the case that those headwinds are persisting longer than she expected, or new ones are emerging, such as China\u2019s economic slowdown.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Officials also have been weighing whether the economy\u2019s equilibrium interest rate\u2014a rate at which the economy is in balance with stable inflation and low unemployment\u2014has fallen because of long-running trends holding back growth and beyond the Fed\u2019s control, such as the retirement of workers and low productivity growth.\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Fed officials last month appeared poised to raise rates in June or July.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Ms. Yellen said in late May a move was probable \u201cin the coming months\u201d if the economy continued to strengthen.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">A dismal May employment report, coupled with concerns about the <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 23 British</span> referendum on whether to leave the European Union, gave officials pause as they weigh when to next raise rates.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Employers added <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 38,000 jobs</span> in May and payroll growth in April and March was revised lower, the Labor Department said earlier this month.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">The share of Americans participating in the workforce also declined, and the number of employees stuck in part-time jobs rose, the report showed.</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Still, the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment insurance remains at historically low levels.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">The decision not to raise rates Wednesday follows recent comments from Ms. Yellen that officials want to wait for more assurance the hiring slowdown is not a harbinger of underlying weakness in the broader economy.\n</span>Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s release, futures markets <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">put 1.9% probability</span> on a rate increase in June and <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 20.6% probability</span> on a move in July. They saw just <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 16% probability</span> of two or more rate increases by December. <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">A recent Wall Street Journal survey of business and academic economists found they expect four quarter-percentage-point increases in the fed-funds rate by the end <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2017,</span> but there was no clear consensus on how many times the Fed would raise rates this year.\n</span>Ms. Yellen won a unanimous vote. <span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Kansas City Fed President Esther George, who dissented in March and April in favor a rate increase, instead voted with the majority.\n</span>Write to Jon Hilsenrath at jon.hilsenrath@wsj.com and Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.com", "displayed_text": "<h3>Fed Leaves Policy Rate Unchanged, Lowers Outlook for Increases</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Fed Leaves Policy Rate Unchanged, Lowers Outlook for Increases\nFed officials project lower rate path <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2017 and</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2018,</span> and in the longer run\nWASHINGTON\u2014The Federal Reserve held its benchmark lending rate steady on Wednesday and officials lowered projections of how much they expect to raise short-term interest rates in the coming years, signs that persistently slow economic growth and low inflation are forcing the central bank to rethink how fast it can move rates higher.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe are quite uncertain about where rates are heading in the longer term,\u201d Chairwoman Janet Yellen said at a press conference following the Fed\u2019s two-day policy meeting.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">New projections show officials expect the fed-funds rate to rise <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 0.875% by</span> the end <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2016,</span> according to the median projection <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 17 officials</span>.</span> Their forecasts imply they see two rate increases this year.

so, it could have consequences in turn for the U.S. economic outlook that would be a factor in deciding on the appropriate path of policy,\u201d Ms. Yellen said of the so-called Brexit vote, set for <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 23.</span>\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">In their official policy statement released after the meeting, Fed officials repeated the refrain they\u2019ve been using all year that they expect \u201ceconomic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">The central bank in December pushed its benchmark interest rate up from near zero to <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 0.25% and</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 0.5%.</span>\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">So far, the economy and financial markets haven\u2019t cooperated with plans to keep moving rates up.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Early in the year, market turbulence and slow growth in economic output gave officials pause.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Growth appears to have picked up and markets settled down, but now hiring and expected inflation are a cause of concern for officials, a mixed backdrop making them reluctant to act.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed while growth in economic activity appears to have picked up,\u201d the Fed said.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">While consumer spending has strengthened, business investment has been soft.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Meantime, market indicators of expected inflation have declined, the Fed said, a development Ms. Yellen noted earlier this month was of some concern.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">The tone of the Fed\u2019s official statement and projections suggest officials will need to see a quick turnaround in economic data and evidence of market resilience if they are to move promptly.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">The Fed indicated its views about risks to the economy haven\u2019t shifted much since April.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">As they said then, officials said they would \u201cclosely monitor\u201d inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.</span> That isn\u2019t a strong endorsement of the outlook. <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">At moments of more confidence, as in December when the Fed raised short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point, the Fed said risks to the economy were balanced.\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">The Fed slightly reduced its estimate for how much economic output will expand this year, shifting its March projection <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2.2% output</span> growth <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 2%.</span></span></span> It also nudged down <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its 2017 growth</span> projection by one tenth of one percent <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 2%.</span></span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">At the same time it nudged up its inflation projection for the year <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 1.4% from</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1.2%,</span> but held most of its other projections steady.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">The combination of relatively stable economic projections and a lower interest rate outlook suggest officials are slowly coming to the conclusion that the economy simply can\u2019t bear very high interest rates, even to achieve mediocre growth and low inflation.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Ms. Yellen has said headwinds are holding back the economy.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">It might be the case that those headwinds are persisting longer than she expected, or new ones are emerging, such as China\u2019s economic slowdown.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Officials also have been weighing whether the economy\u2019s equilibrium interest rate\u2014a rate at which the economy is in balance with stable inflation and low unemployment\u2014has fallen because of long-running trends holding back growth and beyond the Fed\u2019s control, such as the retirement of workers and low productivity growth.\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Fed officials last month appeared poised to raise rates in June or July.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Ms. Yellen said in late May a move was probable \u201cin the coming months\u201d if the economy continued to strengthen.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">A dismal May employment report, coupled with concerns about the <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 23 British</span> referendum on whether to leave the European Union, gave officials pause as they weigh when to next raise rates.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Employers added <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 38,000 jobs</span> in May and payroll growth in April and March was revised lower, the Labor Department said earlier this month.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">The share of Americans participating in the workforce also declined, and the number of employees stuck in part-time jobs rose, the report showed.</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Still, the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment insurance remains at historically low levels.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">The decision not to raise rates Wednesday follows recent comments from Ms. Yellen that officials want to wait for more assurance the hiring slowdown is not a harbinger of underlying weakness in the broader economy.\n</span>Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s release, futures markets <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">put 1.9% probability</span> on a rate increase in June and <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 20.6% probability</span> on a move in July. They saw just <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 16% probability</span> of two or more rate increases by December. <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">A recent Wall Street Journal survey of business and academic economists found they expect four quarter-percentage-point increases in the fed-funds rate by the end <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2017,</span> but there was no clear consensus on how many times the Fed would raise rates this year.\n</span>Ms. Yellen won a unanimous vote. <span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Kansas City Fed President Esther George, who dissented in March and April in favor a rate increase, instead voted with the majority.\n</span>Write to Jon Hilsenrath at jon.hilsenrath@wsj.com and Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.com"}, "46919": {"id": "46919", "text": "<h3>Wall Street shudders as focus returns to recession risks.</h3>Wall Street shudders as focus returns to recession risks.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Stocks tumbled, with the S&<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500 falling</span> further into bear market territory, as investors focused on the threat that inflation and higher interest rates pose to the economy.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">This article is part of our Daily Business Briefing\nS&<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">P 500\nOn</span> Wednesday, investors took comfort that the Federal Reserve would do whatever was necessary to bring inflation to heel, responding to the rallying cry of the Fed chair, Jerome H.

Our columnist turns to history for answers.\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">The Fed on Wednesday announced its largest rate increase in decades.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">It was a forceful \u2014 if, in the view of some economists, belated \u2014 effort to rein in inflation that has proved more severe and more persistent than most forecasters predicted a year ago.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Other central banks are following suit: The Bank of England announced on Thursday its fifth consecutive interest rate increase, and Switzerland\u2019s central bank raised its interest rate for the first time <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 15 years</span>, a more aggressive move than many expected.\n</span>Europe\u2019s <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Stoxx 600 index</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fell 2.5 percent</span>, its seventh decline in eight days.

percent</span>.</span> <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">The concern on Thursday was evident outside the stock market, too.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Copper and oil prices, which historically serve as measures of sentiment about the global economy, traded lower.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Policymakers hope that by raising the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses, they can reduce demand for goods and services and buy time for supply chains and labor markets that have been disrupted by the pandemic to return to normal.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">But bringing down demand, inevitably, means causing economic pain.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">If consumers want fewer goods and services, businesses will have less revenue and will need fewer employees, meaning slower wage growth and, in all likelihood, more layoffs.\n</span>There are hints that the recovery, until now among the strongest on record, is losing momentum. <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">The once red-hot housing market has cooled rapidly as mortgage rates have risen.</span> Fresh government data showed that builders in May broke ground on the fewest new homes in more

Thursday, from just <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 3 percent</span>.</span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Consumers can also expect to pay more on credit card debt, car loans and certain student loans.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">And retail sales fell in May for the first time this year as sky-high gas prices and rising borrowing costs ate into consumers\u2019 budgets.</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">The bear market is likely to worsen consumers\u2019 dismal attitudes.\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">\u201cAlready, households have been squeezed by incredibly high inflation,\u201d said Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist at S&P Global.</span> \u201cYou just have to go to take your car to the gas station and feel the pain. <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">That means that those high prices, both particularly with food and fuel, mean that a lot of people\u2019s paychecks are going into essentials, very little is left to spend elsewhere.</span> People are feeling the pain and are frustrated by it.\u201d\n<span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Forecasters have steadily marked down their outlook for economic growth in the months ahead.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">IHS Markit on Thursday estimated that gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 0.8 percent</span> in the current quarter; last week, they were calling for <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2.4 percent</span> growth rate.</span> A forecasting tool from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta has an even more pessimistic prediction:<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 0.0 percent</span>.\n<span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Such grim forecasts offer the possibility that the economy could end up shrinking this quarter for the second time in a row \u2014 a common, though unofficial, definition of a recession.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">The National Bureau of Economic Research, the country\u2019s semiofficial arbiter of when business cycles begin and end, offers a more nuanced definition of a recession, calling it \u201ca significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.\u201d</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Most economists agree that, by that definition, a recession has not yet begun.\n</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell on Wednesday argued, as he has in the past, that the Fed can bring down inflation without causing a recession, although he acknowledged that its ability to do so depends on factors that are outside its control, such as gas prices, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine.</span> Many analysts are skeptical that such a \u201csoft landing\u201d is realistic. <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">After Mr. Powell\u2019s comments, economists at Deutsche Bank called such hopes \u201coverly optimistic.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Even if the Fed succeeds, however, that doesn\u2019t guarantee a quick recovery for markets.</span> <span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Inflation is likely to come down only slowly.</span> <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Fed officials themselves think it will remain elevated at least through the end of the year.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">The economy, however, could slow relatively quickly.</span> <span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">Europe, which was experiencing slower growth even before Russia invaded Ukraine and has been hit even harder by the spike in energy prices, is particularly vulnerable to such a period of \u201cstagflation\u201d \u2014 a portmanteau of the words stagnation and inflation, used to describe periods of high unemployment and rising prices.\n</span><span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">Analysts say the stock market isn\u2019t likely to regain its footing until there are clear signs that inflation is starting to come under control, which in turn would take pressure off the Fed to raise rates quickly.</span> <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">Stocks briefly rallied in late May, ending a seven-week losing streak, as data seemed to show that gains in consumer prices had peaked.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">But the selling began again last week after a new report on the Consumer Price Index showed that inflation accelerated again, <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">jumping 8.6 percent</span> in May from a year earlier.\n</span><span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">\u201cNot until it is clear that the U.S. has seen peak inflation are concerns about the trajectory of Fed hikes likely to ease significantly,\u201d Jane Foley, a strategist at Rabobank, wrote in an email.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">\u201cMeanwhile, the market sentiment is likely to remain scarred.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">The last time the Fed had to raise rates rapidly to control inflation, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it caused what was at the time the worst recession since the Great Depression.</span> <span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">But economists are optimistic the pain this time won\u2019t be nearly as severe, partly because inflation hasn\u2019t yet become endemic.\n</span>Still, Mr. Bryson noted that recessions, once they begin, often prove hard to escape.\n<span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">\u201cKnock on wood you don\u2019t have to go through the same depth of a recession that we did in \u201981, \u201982 to wring inflation out of the economy today,\u201d he said.</span> <span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe problem though is the stresses of an economic downturn often bring out imbalances that up until that time were largely undetected.\u201d\n</span>Jason Karaian contributed reporting.", "displayed_text": "<h3>Wall Street shudders as focus

last week, they were calling for <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2.4 percent</span> growth rate.</span> A forecasting tool from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta has an even more pessimistic prediction:<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 0.0 percent</span>.\n<span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Such grim forecasts offer the possibility that the economy could end up shrinking this quarter for the second time in a row \u2014 a common, though unofficial, definition of a recession.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">The National Bureau of Economic Research, the country\u2019s semiofficial arbiter of when business cycles begin and end, offers a more nuanced definition of a recession, calling it \u201ca significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.\u201d</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Most economists agree that, by that definition, a recession has not yet begun.\n</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell on Wednesday argued, as he has in the past, that the Fed can bring down inflation without causing a recession, although he acknowledged that its ability to do so depends on factors that are outside its control, such as gas prices, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine.</span> Many analysts are skeptical that such a \u201csoft landing\u201d is realistic. <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">After Mr. Powell\u2019s comments, economists at Deutsche Bank called such hopes \u201coverly optimistic.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Even if the Fed succeeds, however, that doesn\u2019t guarantee a quick recovery for markets.</span> <span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Inflation is likely to come down only slowly.</span> <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Fed officials themselves think it will remain elevated at least through the end of the year.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">The economy, however, could slow relatively quickly.</span> <span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">Europe, which was experiencing slower growth even before Russia invaded Ukraine and has been hit even harder by the spike in energy prices, is particularly vulnerable to such a period of \u201cstagflation\u201d \u2014 a portmanteau of the words stagnation and inflation, used to describe periods of high unemployment and rising prices.\n</span><span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">Analysts say the stock market isn\u2019t likely to regain its footing until there are clear signs that inflation is starting to come under control, which in turn would take pressure off the Fed to raise rates quickly.</span> <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">Stocks briefly rallied in late May, ending a seven-week losing streak, as data seemed to show that gains in consumer prices had peaked.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">But the selling began again last week after a new report on the Consumer Price Index showed that inflation accelerated again, <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">jumping 8.6 percent</span> in May from a year earlier.\n</span><span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">\u201cNot until it is clear that the U.S. has seen peak inflation are concerns about the trajectory of Fed hikes likely to ease significantly,\u201d Jane Foley, a strategist at Rabobank, wrote in an email.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">\u201cMeanwhile, the market sentiment is likely to remain scarred.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">The last time the Fed had to raise rates rapidly to control inflation, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it caused what was at the time the worst recession since the Great Depression.</span> <span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">But economists are optimistic the pain this time won\u2019t be nearly as severe, partly because inflation hasn\u2019t yet become endemic.\n</span>Still, Mr. Bryson noted that recessions, once they begin, often prove hard to escape.\n<span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">\u201cKnock on wood you don\u2019t have to go through the same depth of a recession that we did in \u201981, \u201982 to wring inflation out of the economy today,\u201d he said.</span> <span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe problem though is the stresses of an economic downturn often bring out imbalances that up until that time were largely undetected.\u201d\n</span>Jason Karaian contributed reporting."}, "35519": {"id": "35519", "text": "<h3>Tucker Carlson: How long until Canadian-style tyranny comes to America?</h3>Tucker Carlson: How long until Canadian-style tyranny comes to America?\nIn a dictatorship, the only crime is opposing the regime\nA lot is happening in the news.

Justin Trudeau is Canada's maximum leader, its strongman, its potentate. Justin Trudeau is the dictator of Canada. If you think that's an overstatement, try to think of another way to describe what Justin Trudeau is now doing.\nFor the first time in Canada's history, Trudeau has invoked what's known as the Emergencies Act, but the protests he is facing hardly qualify as an emergency. But suddenly, Justin Trudeau has the power to crush all political opposition to his rule, and that's exactly what he's doing. Trudeau has ended free speech in Canada. He's banned free assembly. Trudeau's government has shut down political rallies and arrested his political critics without probable cause. Trudeau has instituted internal passports, that restrict travel within Canada, to the politically obedient. Canadians are no longer allowed to leave their own country unless they obey Justin Trudeau.

Democrats will try this in this country, guaranteed. They'll tell us Bitcoin is a Russian plot, CNN will dutifully back them up. Watch it happen. But at the same time, you've got to wonder, since we're speaking of terrorism, what happened to the actual terrorists? Those do exist. How is Justin Trudeau treating them? Well, let's see. A few years ago, Justin Trudeau gave more <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $10 million</span> in taxpayer money in a settlement to a self-described Al Qaeda soldier called Omar Khadr. Khadr murdered a U.S. Army sergeant.\nNow murdering a U.S. Army sergeant is bad, but it's not as bad as criticizing Justin Trudeau. So Trudeau did not freeze Khadr's bank account. Instead, he just made him rich and moved on. When anti-Christian arsonists burned more <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 50 Catholic</span> churches across Canada, Justin Trudeau did not declare an emergency. Instead, he issued a statement sympathizing with them, \"It is fully understandable,\" Trudeau said, \"Given the shameful history we all becoming more aware of.\"\nAre you beginning to see how this works? In a dictatorship, the only real crime is opposing the regime. So how did all this happen so quickly in a country as nice and moderate as Canada? Well it happened the way that it always happened. It happened with maximum aggression and limited popular support. Justin Trudeau won reelection last year with less than a third of the national vote. In fact, he finished the election behind his main competitor, the Conservative Party. Thanks to quirks in the parliamentary system, Trudeau took power anyway, and he immediately began to crack down on anyone who opposed him. Trudeau had relatively few supporters, but they turned out to be the right supporters. They were the people with power.\nThe woman, for example, you just saw announcing the crackdown on cryptocurrency is Canada's deputy prime minister. But before she was that, she was a long-time journalist, including in our country. She used to write for The Washington Post. She's currently married to a New York Times reporter. Why is that relevant? Well, because up and down this story, you see the starring role that media organizations have played in the death of Canadian democracy. The other day, for example, somebody hacked the database of the crowdfunding website Give Fund Go, and then revealed the names of people who donated to the truckers protesting in Ottawa. You've got to ask yourself who would have the tech savvy and the political motive to do something like that? Well, state intelligence agencies would. In fact, we can't really think of anybody else. It would certainly be interesting to find out who did it. It's a big part of the story. But media companies seem curiously uninterested in finding out who did it. Instead, they immediately started using this stolen information to intimidate the donors.\nAnyone who dared to send money to Justin Trudeau's political opponents was unmasked in public, shamed, and of course, inevitably threatened. Because that's what happens. Trudeau's state TV channel, the CBC, has been working on this retribution project all day long. They knew who their enemies are, and they knew who their master is. It's Justin Trudeau. But Canada's National Post newspaper is doing the same thing. The National Post is supposedly independent of the government, but they're still doing it. In this country, Vice Media, to its great and eternal shame, has been doing the same thing.\nSo what do all of these media companies have in common? Well, they're all squarely on the side of entrenched power against the population they supposedly serve. That's the opposite of what journalism was designed to do. But at this point, it is the rule. Not just in the United States, but around the world. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Reporters and politicians and big business all align against voters, against you.</span> Have you noticed? Earlier this week, the CBC warned Canadians that the word freedom has \"become common among far-right groups.\" So only QAnon wants freedom. Remember that the next time you complain about Justin Trudeau.\nCANADIAN TRUCKERS: LIVE UPDATES\nMedia organizations have been agitating against democracy for years now, even as they've posed loudly as its greatest defenders. In February <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2020,</span></span> at the beginning of the pandemic, Vice Media ran this headline: \"Anti-vaxxers are terrified the government will 'enforce' a vaccine for coronavirus.\" \"Anti-vax groups on social media are claiming that the spread of the disease will lead to mandatory vaccinations and unlimited surveillance.\" Yeah, those conspiracy nuts. Now that all of that has actually happened, Vice has not apologized, instead Vice is helping Justin Trudeau to hurt anyone who complains about him.\nIn October of that same year,<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2020,</span> the CBC warned Canadians about a \"disinformation campaign [that] falsely suggests Canadians will be forcibly sent to quarantine sites.\" A few months later, as if on cue, the Trudeau government began forcibly sending Canadians to quarantine sites. But the CBC never apologized for posting what turned out to be disinformation. Instead, they set about enforcing Justin Trudeau's latest decrees. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">They see that as their job.</span> So by the way, this is the so-called academic community. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">These are the university professors who've been granted lifetime job security, precisely so they can think for themselves.</span> Freely, independent from government control. And yet, in practice, no one is more controlled by the government than they are. Here's a professor from Canada's Carleton University \u2014 that's an institution heavily funded by Justin Trudeau \u2014 telling CNN's viewers how dangerous and immoral it is to criticize Justin Trudeau in any way. Watch.\nPROFESSOR: I think it's important to remember that at the core of this protest, you know, it was never really about mandates in the first place. It's always been about a small group of people who called for a convoy, who hold very anti-government views, as well as kind of a racist and white supremacist views, conspiratorial world views.\nOh, they hold anti-government views, that's the crime. But isn't holding anti-government views allowed in a democracy? In fact, isn't the measure of democratic government the degree to which you're allowed to question the people in charge? Well, that used to be the definition of democracy. It's not anymore, certainly not on CNN. The CNN anchor who heard that just nodded. Yes, it is indeed a scary problem when Canadians disagree with Justin Trudeau \u2014 arrest them. On MSNBC, which is less subtle, but a lot more straightforward most of the time, they're telling Justin Trudeau to stop with the half measures; the problem with Canada is it's not authoritarian enough. Time to get the stick and start hurting people.\nJOE SCARBOROUGH: I do have to ask one question, though the liberal prime minister in Canada. Seriously? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, if I'm a mayor or I'm a prime minister, your trucks get in my city street? They're not going to stay there a week. No, no, no, no. They're not going to stay, there's going to be somebody with a stick and it's going to be banging on the window. It's going to say, you got one or two options in this thing. Are we going to cuff you and take you to jail and we're going to pound this and we're going to find your company. Move it or lose it.\nSettle down, tough guy. There's going to be someone there with a stick. It's interesting. It's always the very same people who call for violence. It's almost like it excites them. It's not a good sign. So clearly there is an appetite for Canadian-style tyranny in this country, and the question is how long til we get it? Let's see.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">This morning we learned that American intelligence agencies are trying to censor a financial website called ZeroHedge.</span> Unnamed sources from Joe Biden's intel community told The Associated Press, off-the-record of course, that ZeroHedge was, \"spreading Russian propaganda,\" by which they meant criticizing Joe Biden. We can't have that. So how long before they pull ZeroHedge off the internet? How long before they try the same thing with Joe Biden's many other critics in the media? All of whom, we can tell you firsthand, have also been accused of working for Vladimir Putin.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAnd when that does happen, when these voices are silenced, what will we call it then? CNN will, of course, describe it as a necessary national security measure. But it's not that. It's tyranny. And by the way, since when does the CIA get to decide what websites Americans read? Are there any civil libertarians left in this country? Old-fashioned liberals, anyone? What do they think of this? Maybe they don't notice it. In their defense, it's hard to notice sometimes with leaders like Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau. They don't look very threatening. They're not the Hollywood version of fascist. Look at Justin Trudeau. He's absurd. The '70s haircut, all those little outfits when he feels like playing dress-up. He doesn't look dangerous, he looks ridiculous.\nBut maybe Justin Trudeau is smarter than he looks. Leaders like Biden and Trudeau avoid the usual tells. They don't use armies to invade other countries, for example. Instead, they promote color revolutions and control foreign governments from afar. That's exactly what they did in Ukraine, which became a far more repressive place once Joe Biden began running it, and he does run Ukraine. Make no mistake. That's what they do. This new class of dictators seizes power incrementally, through the bureaucracy. They never raise their voices. They don't wave their arms. They smile and they tell you they're protecting democracy and public health. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">They praise diversity, even as they demand conformity.</span> They're entirely passive-aggressive. But they're no less dangerous. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">One morning you wake up and they've canceled your job and seized your bank account for the crime of disagreeing with them.</span> This is the architecture of tyranny, and it's not just happening in Canada. It's happening here in the United States. It will be used against us.

In February <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2020,</span></span> at the beginning of the pandemic, Vice Media ran this headline: \"Anti-vaxxers are terrified the government will 'enforce' a vaccine for coronavirus.\" \"Anti-vax groups on social media are claiming that the spread of the disease will lead to mandatory vaccinations and unlimited surveillance.\" Yeah, those conspiracy nuts. Now that all of that has actually happened, Vice has not apologized, instead Vice is helping Justin Trudeau to hurt anyone who complains about him.\nIn October of that same year,<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2020,</span> the CBC warned Canadians about a \"disinformation campaign [that] falsely suggests Canadians will be forcibly sent to quarantine sites.\" A few months later, as if on cue, the Trudeau government began forcibly sending Canadians to quarantine sites. But the CBC never apologized for posting what turned out to be disinformation. Instead, they set about enforcing Justin Trudeau's latest decrees. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">They see that as their job.</span> So by the way, this is the so-called academic community. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">These are the university professors who've been granted lifetime job security, precisely so they can think for themselves.</span> Freely, independent from government control. And yet, in practice, no one is more controlled by the government than they are. Here's a professor from Canada's Carleton University \u2014 that's an institution heavily funded by Justin Trudeau \u2014 telling CNN's viewers how dangerous and immoral it is to criticize Justin Trudeau in any way. Watch.\nPROFESSOR: I think it's important to remember that at the core of this protest, you know, it was never really about mandates in the first place. It's always been about a small group of people who called for a convoy, who hold very anti-government views, as well as kind of a racist and white supremacist views, conspiratorial world views.\nOh, they hold anti-government views, that's the crime. But isn't holding anti-government views allowed in a democracy? In fact, isn't the measure of democratic government the degree to which you're allowed to question the people in charge? Well, that used to be the definition of democracy. It's not anymore, certainly not on CNN. The CNN anchor who heard that just nodded. Yes, it is indeed a scary problem when Canadians disagree with Justin Trudeau \u2014 arrest them. On MSNBC, which is less subtle, but a lot more straightforward most of the time, they're telling Justin Trudeau to stop with the half measures; the problem with Canada is it's not authoritarian enough. Time to get the stick and start hurting people.\nJOE SCARBOROUGH: I do have to ask one question, though the liberal prime minister in Canada. Seriously? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, if I'm a mayor or I'm a prime minister, your trucks get in my city street? They're not going to stay there a week. No, no, no, no. They're not going to stay, there's going to be somebody with a stick and it's going to be banging on the window. It's going to say, you got one or two options in this thing. Are we going to cuff you and take you to jail and we're going to pound this and we're going to find your company. Move it or lose it.\nSettle down, tough guy. There's going to be someone there with a stick. It's interesting. It's always the very same people who call for violence. It's almost like it excites them. It's not a good sign. So clearly there is an appetite for Canadian-style tyranny in this country, and the question is how long til we get it? Let's see.\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">This morning we learned that American intelligence agencies are trying to censor a financial website called ZeroHedge.</span> Unnamed sources from Joe Biden's intel community told The Associated Press, off-the-record of course, that ZeroHedge was, \"spreading Russian propaganda,\" by which they meant criticizing Joe Biden. We can't have that. So how long before they pull ZeroHedge off the internet? How long before they try the same thing with Joe Biden's many other critics in the media? All of whom, we can tell you firsthand, have also been accused of working for Vladimir Putin.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAnd when that does happen, when these voices are silenced, what will we call it then? CNN will, of course, describe it as a necessary national security measure. But it's not that. It's tyranny. And by the way, since when does the CIA get to decide what websites Americans read? Are there any civil libertarians left in this country? Old-fashioned liberals, anyone? What do they think of this? Maybe they don't notice it. In their defense, it's hard to notice sometimes with leaders like Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau. They don't look very threatening. They're not the Hollywood version of fascist. Look at Justin Trudeau. He's absurd. The '70s haircut, all those little outfits when he feels like playing dress-up. He doesn't look dangerous, he looks ridiculous.\nBut maybe Justin Trudeau is smarter than he looks. Leaders like Biden and Trudeau avoid the usual tells. They don't use armies to invade other countries, for example. Instead, they promote color revolutions and control foreign governments from afar. That's exactly what they did in Ukraine, which became a far more repressive place once Joe Biden began running it, and he does run Ukraine. Make no mistake. That's what they do. This new class of dictators seizes power incrementally, through the bureaucracy. They never raise their voices. They don't wave their arms. They smile and they tell you they're protecting democracy and public health. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">They praise diversity, even as they demand conformity.</span> They're entirely passive-aggressive. But they're no less dangerous. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">One morning you wake up and they've canceled your job and seized your bank account for the crime of disagreeing with them.</span> This is the architecture of tyranny, and it's not just happening in Canada. It's happening here in the United States. It will be used against us. Bet on it.\nThis article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening monologue on the <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">February 15,</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2022 edition</span> of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\""}, "9308": {"id": "9308", "text": "<h3>Running second makes Cruz everyone\u2019s target at GOP debate</h3>Before Thursday night\u2019s sixth presidential debate, Sen.

This chart should convince you.]\nThe exchange came at the end of tough night for both Cruz and Rubio, first-term senators who once worked as allies but now are in each other\u2019s way. Besides the battle between them, Cruz took criticism from Trump, and Rubio was attacked by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida governor Jeb Bush, his rivals in the \u201cestablishment\u201d lane of this race.\nEarlier in the evening, Christie had lived up to his pugilistic reputation, threatening to kick President Obama\u2019s \u201crear\u201d at one point, and rebuking Rubio for dodging a question with a blunt \u201cYou blew it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like to interrupt. I\u2019d like to interrupt. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">I\u2019d like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate,\u201d Christie quipped, as Rubio and Cruz argued at length over the intricacies of their respective corporate tax proposals.</span> He said they were trying to dodge a harder question on \u201centitlement\u201d programs like Medicare and Social Security. \u201cDo you remember that everybody? This is a question on entitlements.\u201d\n[Christie hits back: Rubio can\u2019t \u2018slime his way to the White House\u2019]\nRubio, who had tangled with Christie earlier in the evening, tried to interrupt. Christie dismissed him: \u201cNah. You\u2019ve already your chance, Marco. You blew it.\u201d\nChristie also criticized Obama for allowing states to legalize marijuana, and for undermining American\u2019s respect for police officers \u2013 an apparent reference to Obama\u2019s reaction to the protests over shootings by police. Obama and his allies, Christie said, \u201cgive the benefit of the doubt to the criminal. Not to the police officer.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Earlier, Bush was strongly critical of Trump, calling his rival \u201cunhinged\u201d for his policies on immigration and misguided in his plans for high tariffs on Chinese imports.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis would be devastating for our economy.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">We need somebody with a steady hand being president of the United States,\u201d Bush said, after Trump said he would threaten large new tariffs on Chinese goods unless China took actions to make its trade with the U.S. more fair.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Bush said it would lead to retaliatory actions by China, which would hurt U.S. exports there.\n</span>Trump responded with an attack on Bush\u2019s personality.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need a weak person being president of the United States,\u201d Trump said, returning to an old insult that Bush is \u201clow-energy.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t need that. We don\u2019t need that.\u201d\nThe crowd in North Charleston, S.C., booed at that, too \u2013 one of several times when they seemed to turn against the front-runner.\nQuestioning Trump\u2019s proposal to bar Muslim foreigners from entering the United States, Bush said that it would alienate vital Muslim allies in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\u201cAll Muslims? Seriously?\u201d Bush said, in one of his strongest moments during six not-very-strong debates. \u201cThey are unhinged,\u201d he said of Trump\u2019s comments on the subject.\nA moderator pointed out that Trump\u2019s support had risen in South Carolina by eight points since then.\n\u201cEleven points to be exact,\u201d Trump interjected. He responded with a general statement of concern about Islamic terrorism: \u201cThere\u2019s something going on, and it\u2019s bad. We have to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\nThe exchange came after Trump had rebuked Cruz for talking negatively about \u201cNew York values,\u201d offering a tribute to the city\u2019s response to the Sept.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11,</span></span><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2001,</span> terrorist attacks.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cWhen the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York,\u201d Trump said.</span> He continued: \u201cThe people in new York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death. Nobody understood it. And it was with us for months, the smell in the air.\nThat followed an attack by Cruz in which he said that \u201cNew York values\u201d were socially liberal, and tied to money and the media. He said that Trump was representative of those values, and therefore not aligned with the values of early-voting states such as South Carolina, where the debate was held.\n\u201cI have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made,\u201d Trump said.\nIt was the second time in this debate that Cruz and Trump \u2013 who had once had an unofficial alliance, but now are rivals \u2013 had tangled, with Trump having the last word. Earlier in the debate, the two had argued about whether Cruz was even eligible to run for president, since he was born in Canada to an American mother. That led to a long exchange that allowed Trump to restate the point again and again.\n[The conservative media\u2019s civil war over Ted Cruz \u2018birtherism\u2019]\nIn the shadow of those two, a pair of lower-polling rivals \u2014 Christie and Rubio \u2013 each tried to cast the other as too liberal and too friendly to Obama\u2019s priorities. Christie, in particular, responded with some unusually tough words for Obama himself.\n\u201cThis guy is a petulant child,\u201d Christie said, when asked about Obama\u2019s efforts to circumvent Congress with executive actions to expand background checks on gun purchases. Christie then said he hoped that Obama was watching: \u201cWe are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall!\u201d\nUnless Christie knows something everybody else doesn\u2019t, Obama is not running in the election this fall. He is scheduled to leave office in January, when a new president takes office.\nDuring the exchange about Cruz\u2019s citizenship, Trump told Cruz that \u201cthere\u2019s a big question mark on your head, and you can\u2019t do that to the party.\u201d\n\u201cWho the hell knows if you can run for office?\u201d Trump added.\nThe exchange took several minutes, and also demonstrated the danger \u2013 even for a skillful debater like Cruz \u2013 of tangling with Trump, a trained master of reality TV. It began with a question for Cruz, who was born in Canada to an American mother, about whether he fit the Constitution\u2019s definition of a \u201cnatural born\u201d American citizen, and was eligible to run for president. He said that Trump had dismissed the idea earlier in the race but now was suddenly concerned.\n\u201cThe Constitution hasn\u2019t changed. But the poll numbers have. And I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling,\u201d Cruz said.\nThat set off a long exchange in which Trump admitted he had, indeed, become more concerned because of Cruz\u2019s rise in the polls. \u201cBecause now he\u2019s doing a little bit better. You know, I didn\u2019t care before,\u201d Trump said, although he also reminded Cruz that he was still ahead in the polls. \u201cHe\u2019s got probably <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 4 or</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 5 percent</span> chance\u201d of winning the race. Trump imagined a scenario in which Trump himself might choose Cruz as a running mate, \u201cAnd the Democrats sue because we can\u2019t take him along for the ride. I don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump,\u201d Cruz, a Harvard Law graduate and former Supreme Court clerk, responded. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Cruz said that maybe he would make Trump a vice president, which means he could benefit if Cruz was disqualified: \u201cYou can get the top job at the end of the day.\u201d\n</span>Eventually, Rubio butted in. \u201cI hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.\u201d\nEarlier in the debate, Trump had called Syrian refugees a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d that brought terrorist sympathizers into the U.S.\n\u201cIt\u2019s reality. You just have to look today at Indonesia. Bombings all over. You look at California. You look, frankly, at Paris,\u201d Trump said when asked about a refugee that President Obama had invited as his guest to the State of the Union. Trump said that refugee\u2019s sympathetic story was not typical: \u201cThat\u2019s not representative of what you have in that line of migration. That could be the great Trojan horse.\u201d\nTrump has said that he wants a temporary ban on all Muslim foreigners seeking to enter the U.S., and a wall to keep out undocumented immigrants along the border with Mexico. He did not appear to have changed that tactic: \u201cWe can\u2019t let all these people come into our country and break our borders. We can\u2019t do it.\u201d\nAt one point in the debate, Cruz was asked about a New York Times report that he had failed to disclose loans made to him by Citibank and Goldman Sachs with election officials, while he ran for the Senate from Texas <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012.</span> Cruz later disclosed the information with Senate authorities. He rejected it as a \u201chit piece.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I made a paperwork error, disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other. But if that\u2019s the best that the New York Times has got, they\u2019d better go back to the well,\u201d Cruz said.\nCruz began the night by criticizing Obama for failing to mention <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 10 U</span>.S. sailors who were seized \u2013 and later released \u2013 by Iranian forces in the Persian Gulf, calling it evidence of Obama\u2019s weakness.\n\u201cWe were horrified to see the sight <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 10 American</span> sailors on their knees with their hands on their head. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">In that state of the union, President Obama didn\u2019t so much as mention <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">those 10 sailors</span>,\u201d Cruz said, ignoring \u2013 for the moment \u2013 the fact that he had actually been asked about jobs.</span> \u201cIt was heartbreaking. But the good news is the next commander in chief is standing on this stage.\u201d\nThe sailors were later released by Iran, and the Pentagon said Thursday that they had entered Iranian territorial waters by mistake after a navigational error. But Cruz said that the sailors\u2019 treatment \u2013 including the release of footage that showed them with hands on their heads as they were taken into custody \u2013 would have drawn a sharper response from a President Cruz.\n\u201cAny nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America,\u201d Cruz said.\nLater, Christie criticized Obama for underplaying the threats to the U.S.: \u201cI watched storytime with Barack Obama.\u201d\nThe main debate, which began <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 9 p</span>.m., was preceded by an \u201cundercard\u201d debate among former tech executive Carly Fiorina, former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.) and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee.\nIn the earlier debate, the trio of long-shot candidates offered gloomy visions of the country\u2019s path, all hoping that they might get a ticket to the top tier of the race with just a few weeks remaining until the first votes.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Fox Business Network hosted both debates.\n</span>Cruz, in the past, had seemed reluctant to attack Trump \u2014 perhaps hoping that he would inherit Trump\u2019s anti-establishment coalition if Trump himself faded. Now, the Texas Republican seems to have given up on that \u2014 or perhaps he is trying to hasten Trump\u2019s fade a bit faster.\nIn recent days, for example, Cruz took direct aim at Trump on several fronts: tying the billionaire to Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, questioning his ability to win a general election and casting doubt on his ability to serve as commander in chief.\nCruz also took aim at Trump\u2019s competence. \u201cDoes a potential commander in chief know what the nuclear triad is, much less is he or she prepared and able to strengthen it and keep this country safe?\u201d Cruz asked on \u201cThe Hugh Hewitt Show.\u201d\nIn a Republican debate last month, Trump was asked about the nuclear triad \u2014 the submarines, bombers and land-based missiles that could deliver the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons \u2014 and had trouble with the explanation.\nDuring a campaign rally in Pensacola, Fla., on Wednesday night, Trump bragged that rivals who have attacked him in the past have seen their poll numbers tank, sometimes to the point of being pushed out of the race.\n\u201cNow, we have another debate tomorrow. They\u2019ll all be attacking me \u2014 like, you know, they attack. Whatever. Right? Whatever. What-ever,\u201d Trump said, pursing his lips and shaking his head, as some in the crowd started chanting: \u201cWe want Trump! We want Trump!\u201d\n\u201cThey attack,\u201d Trump said, \u201cbut they don\u2019t understand that unlike this country, I attack back.\u201d\nThursday\u2019s main-event debate was the smallest of this crowded campaign so far: just seven candidates onstage, down from the high <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 11 during</span> a debate in September.\nSen. Rand Paul (Ky.), the libertarian-leaning candidate who battled with Rubio and Christie over their hawkish foreign policies, is sitting this one out. Paul\u2019s polling numbers were so low he was relegated to the undercard debate. He then refused to show up at all, saying he was not running an undercard kind of campaign. He also has asked Fox to reconsider and put him on the main stage.\nAlthough Ohio Gov. John Kasich did not figure in the more contentious exchanges, he sought to appeal directly to frustrated middle- and working-class families.\n\u201cPeople are upset,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">re 50 or</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 51 years</span> old and some kid walks in and tells you you\u2019re out of work and you don\u2019t know where to go and where to turn. Do we have an answer for that? We do.\u201d\n[Who\u2019s got the best ground game in New Hampshire? We may never know.]\nThen there was Bush: once this race\u2019s front-runner, now one of its longer shots.\nOnce again, he was hoping for a debate performance that will reset the race. That has not gone well in the past: In a previous debate where Bush badly wanted a breakout, he picked a fight over Rubio\u2019s voting and attendance record in the Senate and provoked a damaging verbal takedown.\nAs the leading candidates feuded Thursday, Bush interjected to call for a cease-fire.\n\u201cEverybody on this stage is better than [Democratic front-runner] Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it\u2019s going to be . . . to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.\u201d\n[Bush and his super PAC are on the attack \u2013 but aiming at different targets]\nBen Carson, the mild-mannered neurosurgeon, seconded Bush\u2019s call. \u201cWe have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves and we lose the next election and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.\u201d\nCarson\u2019s oddball campaign \u2014 which included days-long debates about whether, as a young man, he really stabbed a friend in the stomach or menaced his mother with a hammer \u2014 now seems to be fading.\n[After a dramatic fade, can Ben Carson hang on in Iowa?]\nJose A.

This is a question on entitlements.\u201d\n[Christie hits back: Rubio can\u2019t \u2018slime his way to the White House\u2019]\nRubio, who had tangled with Christie earlier in the evening, tried to interrupt. Christie dismissed him: \u201cNah. You\u2019ve already your chance, Marco. You blew it.\u201d\nChristie also criticized Obama for allowing states to legalize marijuana, and for undermining American\u2019s respect for police officers \u2013 an apparent reference to Obama\u2019s reaction to the protests over shootings by police. Obama and his allies, Christie said, \u201cgive the benefit of the doubt to the criminal. Not to the police officer.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Earlier, Bush was strongly critical of Trump, calling his rival \u201cunhinged\u201d for his policies on immigration and misguided in his plans for high tariffs on Chinese imports.\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">\u201cThis would be devastating for our economy.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">We need somebody with a steady hand being president of the United States,\u201d Bush said, after Trump said he would threaten large new tariffs on Chinese goods unless China took actions to make its trade with the U.S. more fair.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Bush said it would lead to retaliatory actions by China, which would hurt U.S. exports there.\n</span>Trump responded with an attack on Bush\u2019s personality.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need a weak person being president of the United States,\u201d Trump said, returning to an old insult that Bush is \u201clow-energy.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t need that. We don\u2019t need that.\u201d\nThe crowd in North Charleston, S.C., booed at that, too \u2013 one of several times when they seemed to turn against the front-runner.\nQuestioning Trump\u2019s proposal to bar Muslim foreigners from entering the United States, Bush said that it would alienate vital Muslim allies in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\u201cAll Muslims? Seriously?\u201d Bush said, in one of his strongest moments during six not-very-strong debates. \u201cThey are unhinged,\u201d he said of Trump\u2019s comments on the subject.\nA moderator pointed out that Trump\u2019s support had risen in South Carolina by eight points since then.\n\u201cEleven points to be exact,\u201d Trump interjected. He responded with a general statement of concern about Islamic terrorism: \u201cThere\u2019s something going on, and it\u2019s bad. We have to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\nThe exchange came after Trump had rebuked Cruz for talking negatively about \u201cNew York values,\u201d offering a tribute to the city\u2019s response to the Sept.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11,</span></span><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2001,</span> terrorist attacks.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cWhen the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York,\u201d Trump said.</span> He continued: \u201cThe people in new York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death. Nobody understood it. And it was with us for months, the smell in the air.\nThat followed an attack by Cruz in which he said that \u201cNew York values\u201d were socially liberal, and tied to money and the media. He said that Trump was representative of those values, and therefore not aligned with the values of early-voting states such as South Carolina, where the debate was held.\n\u201cI have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made,\u201d Trump said.\nIt was the second time in this debate that Cruz and Trump \u2013 who had once had an unofficial alliance, but now are rivals \u2013 had tangled, with Trump having the last word. Earlier in the debate, the two had argued about whether Cruz was even eligible to run for president, since he was born in Canada to an American mother. That led to a long exchange that allowed Trump to restate the point again and again.\n[The conservative media\u2019s civil war over Ted Cruz \u2018birtherism\u2019]\nIn the shadow of those two, a pair of lower-polling rivals \u2014 Christie and Rubio \u2013 each tried to cast the other as too liberal and too friendly to Obama\u2019s priorities. Christie, in particular, responded with some unusually tough words for Obama himself.\n\u201cThis guy is a petulant child,\u201d Christie said, when asked about Obama\u2019s efforts to circumvent Congress with executive actions to expand background checks on gun purchases. Christie then said he hoped that Obama was watching: \u201cWe are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall!\u201d\nUnless Christie knows something everybody else doesn\u2019t, Obama is not running in the election this fall. He is scheduled to leave office in January, when a new president takes office.\nDuring the exchange about Cruz\u2019s citizenship, Trump told Cruz that \u201cthere\u2019s a big question mark on your head, and you can\u2019t do that to the party.\u201d\n\u201cWho the hell knows if you can run for office?\u201d Trump added.\nThe exchange took several minutes, and also demonstrated the danger \u2013 even for a skillful debater like Cruz \u2013 of tangling with Trump, a trained master of reality TV. It began with a question for Cruz, who was born in Canada to an American mother, about whether he fit the Constitution\u2019s definition of a \u201cnatural born\u201d American citizen, and was eligible to run for president. He said that Trump had dismissed the idea earlier in the race but now was suddenly concerned.\n\u201cThe Constitution hasn\u2019t changed. But the poll numbers have. And I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling,\u201d Cruz said.\nThat set off a long exchange in which Trump admitted he had, indeed, become more concerned because of Cruz\u2019s rise in the polls. \u201cBecause now he\u2019s doing a little bit better. You know, I didn\u2019t care before,\u201d Trump said, although he also reminded Cruz that he was still ahead in the polls. \u201cHe\u2019s got probably <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 4 or</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 5 percent</span> chance\u201d of winning the race. Trump imagined a scenario in which Trump himself might choose Cruz as a running mate, \u201cAnd the Democrats sue because we can\u2019t take him along for the ride. I don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump,\u201d Cruz, a Harvard Law graduate and former Supreme Court clerk, responded. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Cruz said that maybe he would make Trump a vice president, which means he could benefit if Cruz was disqualified: \u201cYou can get the top job at the end of the day.\u201d\n</span>Eventually, Rubio butted in. \u201cI hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.\u201d\nEarlier in the debate, Trump had called Syrian refugees a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d that brought terrorist sympathizers into the U.S.\n\u201cIt\u2019s reality. You just have to look today at Indonesia. Bombings all over. You look at California. You look, frankly, at Paris,\u201d Trump said when asked about a refugee that President Obama had invited as his guest to the State of the Union. Trump said that refugee\u2019s sympathetic story was not typical: \u201cThat\u2019s not representative of what you have in that line of migration. That could be the great Trojan horse.\u201d\nTrump has said that he wants a temporary ban on all Muslim foreigners seeking to enter the U.S., and a wall to keep out undocumented immigrants along the border with Mexico. He did not appear to have changed that tactic: \u201cWe can\u2019t let all these people come into our country and break our borders. We can\u2019t do it.\u201d\nAt one point in the debate, Cruz was asked about a New York Times report that he had failed to disclose loans made to him by Citibank and Goldman Sachs with election officials, while he ran for the Senate from Texas <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012.</span> Cruz later disclosed the information with Senate authorities. He rejected it as a \u201chit piece.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I made a paperwork error, disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other. But if that\u2019s the best that the New York Times has got, they\u2019d better go back to the well,\u201d Cruz said.\nCruz began the night by criticizing Obama for failing to mention <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 10 U</span>.S. sailors who were seized \u2013 and later released \u2013 by Iranian forces in the Persian Gulf, calling it evidence of Obama\u2019s weakness.\n\u201cWe were horrified to see the sight <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 10 American</span> sailors on their knees with their hands on their head. <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">In that state of the union, President Obama didn\u2019t so much as mention <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">those 10 sailors</span>,\u201d Cruz said, ignoring \u2013 for the moment \u2013 the fact that he had actually been asked about jobs.</span> \u201cIt was heartbreaking. But the good news is the next commander in chief is standing on this stage.\u201d\nThe sailors were later released by Iran, and the Pentagon said Thursday that they had entered Iranian territorial waters by mistake after a navigational error. But Cruz said that the sailors\u2019 treatment \u2013 including the release of footage that showed them with hands on their heads as they were taken into custody \u2013 would have drawn a sharper response from a President Cruz.\n\u201cAny nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America,\u201d Cruz said.\nLater, Christie criticized Obama for underplaying the threats to the U.S.: \u201cI watched storytime with Barack Obama.\u201d\nThe main debate, which began <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 9 p</span>.m., was preceded by an \u201cundercard\u201d debate among former tech executive Carly Fiorina, former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.) and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee.\nIn the earlier debate, the trio of long-shot candidates offered gloomy visions of the country\u2019s path, all hoping that they might get a ticket to the top tier of the race with just a few weeks remaining until the first votes.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Fox Business Network hosted both debates.\n</span>Cruz, in the past, had seemed reluctant to attack Trump \u2014 perhaps hoping that he would inherit Trump\u2019s anti-establishment coalition if Trump himself faded. Now, the Texas Republican seems to have given up on that \u2014 or perhaps he is trying to hasten Trump\u2019s fade a bit faster.\nIn recent days, for example, Cruz took direct aim at Trump on several fronts: tying the billionaire to Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, questioning his ability to win a general election and casting doubt on his ability to serve as commander in chief.\nCruz also took aim at Trump\u2019s competence. \u201cDoes a potential commander in chief know what the nuclear triad is, much less is he or she prepared and able to strengthen it and keep this country safe?\u201d Cruz asked on \u201cThe Hugh Hewitt Show.\u201d\nIn a Republican debate last month, Trump was asked about the nuclear triad \u2014 the submarines, bombers and land-based missiles that could deliver the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons \u2014 and had trouble with the explanation.\nDuring a campaign rally in Pensacola, Fla., on Wednesday night, Trump bragged that rivals who have attacked him in the past have seen their poll numbers tank, sometimes to the point of being pushed out of the race.\n\u201cNow, we have another debate tomorrow. They\u2019ll all be attacking me \u2014 like, you know, they attack. Whatever. Right? Whatever. What-ever,\u201d Trump said, pursing his lips and shaking his head, as some in the crowd started chanting: \u201cWe want Trump! We want Trump!\u201d\n\u201cThey attack,\u201d Trump said, \u201cbut they don\u2019t understand that unlike this country, I attack back.\u201d\nThursday\u2019s main-event debate was the smallest of this crowded campaign so far: just seven candidates onstage, down from the high <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 11 during</span> a debate in September.\nSen. Rand Paul (Ky.), the libertarian-leaning candidate who battled with Rubio and Christie over their hawkish foreign policies, is sitting this one out. Paul\u2019s polling numbers were so low he was relegated to the undercard debate. He then refused to show up at all, saying he was not running an undercard kind of campaign. He also has asked Fox to reconsider and put him on the main stage.\nAlthough Ohio Gov. John Kasich did not figure in the more contentious exchanges, he sought to appeal directly to frustrated middle- and working-class families.\n\u201cPeople are upset,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">re 50 or</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 51 years</span> old and some kid walks in and tells you you\u2019re out of work and you don\u2019t know where to go and where to turn. Do we have an answer for that? We do.\u201d\n[Who\u2019s got the best ground game in New Hampshire? We may never know.]\nThen there was Bush: once this race\u2019s front-runner, now one of its longer shots.\nOnce again, he was hoping for a debate performance that will reset the race. That has not gone well in the past: In a previous debate where Bush badly wanted a breakout, he picked a fight over Rubio\u2019s voting and attendance record in the Senate and provoked a damaging verbal takedown.\nAs the leading candidates feuded Thursday, Bush interjected to call for a cease-fire.\n\u201cEverybody on this stage is better than [Democratic front-runner] Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it\u2019s going to be . . . to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.\u201d\n[Bush and his super PAC are on the attack \u2013 but aiming at different targets]\nBen Carson, the mild-mannered neurosurgeon, seconded Bush\u2019s call. \u201cWe have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves and we lose the next election and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.\u201d\nCarson\u2019s oddball campaign \u2014 which included days-long debates about whether, as a young man, he really stabbed a friend in the stomach or menaced his mother with a hammer \u2014 now seems to be fading.\n[After a dramatic fade, can Ben Carson hang on in Iowa?]\nJose A.
