They were briefly taken into custody, detained for a few hours and released without charges.\n\n\u201cCompanies must accept the era of secrecy is over,\u201d says Zitto Kabwe, the head of the Tanzanian parliament\u2019s public-accounts committee, who witnessed the scene.\n\nTPDC declined to comment on the police detention of its executives, and Tanzania\u2019s ministry of energy and minerals didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Battles over contract transparency are brewing across Africa, touching on sensitive tax issues among energy and mineral giants trying to tap into a new frontier of the global economy.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The clashes show how once-malleable African governments are fighting for a bigger share of earnings in sometimes-secretive deals, often following the advice of Western groups such as the Soros Foundation and the African Governance Initiative, which is headed by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\n</span>The upshot: A raft of legal disputes that have stalled production of some key projects and frayed relationships between African governments and foreign investors.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Uganda remains embroiled in a litany of tax disputes with Tullow Oil PLC and Heritage Oil Corp., nearly a decade after oil reserves were discovered.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The country had amended its income-tax law to introduce a capital-gains tax on the sale of oil rights shortly after the discoveries, prompting Heritage and Tullow to contest the new tax assessments.\n\n</span>Zambia\u2019s mining industry is faltering after the government in October decided to more than triple mine royalties <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 20%,</span> following the advice of Western groups. This compelled miners such as First Quantum Minerals Ltd. and Glencore PLC to <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">suspend $2 billion</span> in expansion projects.\n\nAnd in Guinea, disputes stemming from government changes to a lease for the Simandou iron-ore mine are dogging the project.\n\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Some experts argue the disputes reveal a blurring between demands for more disclosure from investors and more tax revenue from governments.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s about negotiating to get a better deal in terms of money ... <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">income, but not necessarily transparency,\u201d says Carlos Lopes, the chief of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.\n\n</span>African governments have found ready partners for both endeavors. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Western organizations such as the Soros Foundation, founded by hedge-fund billionaire George Soros, and international institutions like the United Nations and the World Bank are providing advisory services to resource-rich nations on how to adjust ownership structures and rejigger tax laws for a bigger slice of revenues.\n\n</span>Some analysts say this is a necessary tilting of the scales toward African governments.\n\n\u201cThe deals often favor the companies which have access to vast experience and capital, while the governments do not have the experience, institutions or laws in place to manage their natural resources,\u201d says George Boden, an analyst with U.K.-based anticorruption group Global Witness.\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The African Governance Initiative\u2014headed by Mr. Blair\u2014has helped Rwanda become the region\u2019s first country to issue mining certificates at the point of export, in an effort to keep conflict minerals out of the supply chain.\n\n</span>In Guinea, Mr. Soros, through his foundations, played a key role in advising the government on its review of mining deals struck by previous governments. This led to the ouster of BSG Resources, the mining arm of Israeli tycoon Beny Steinmetz\u2019s family-owned conglomerate, from the country earlier this year and the ushering in of Rio Tinto PLC.\n\nMr. Steinmetz has since sued Global Witness\u2014partly funded by the Soros Foundation\u2014which accused his company of obtaining mining rights in the country through corruption. BSG also is in international arbitration with Guinea in a bid to win compensation for being stripped of the Simandou mine. BSG Resources has denied wrongdoing and accused President Alpha Cond\u00e9\u2019s government of seeking to expropriate its rights by stealth\u2014a claim the government rejects.\n\nSimandou\u2019s current operator Rio Tinto has also sued rival Vale SA and Mr. Steinmetz, alleging that they colluded to rob the Anglo-Australian company of the highly prized iron-ore concession, further complicating the legal battles around the mine. Both parties denied Rio Tinto\u2019s allegations, which a BSG Resources spokesman called \u201cbaseless and bizarre.\u201d\n\nIn Tanzania, the recent police detention of the oil-company executives capped months of a simmering row at the local parliament over whether the East African nation is getting a fair deal for its newfound vast natural-gas resources.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Mr. Kabwe\u2019s fight to make all contracts public kicked off in August, when part of the contract with Norway\u2019s Statoil ASA and ExxonMobil Corp. was leaked to the local press, showing that the state-run Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation, or TPDC, had agreed to terms yielding 30%-50% of the revenue for state coffers\u2014well below the 50%-80% yields recommended by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\n\n</span>Tanzania <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2009 signed</span> the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, an effort led by non-governmental organizations to bring contracts to light. Though most of Africa\u2019s other mineral-rich nations also are signatories, implementation has been uneven.\n\nMr. Kabwe, who heads the parliament\u2019s public-accounts committee, ordered TPDC to bring all contracts to parliament for scrutiny, but the state-run company cited investor reluctance to publicize the terms. It didn\u2019t comply with a Nov.<span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3 deadline</span>\u2014at which point the two senior TPDC board members were briefly taken into custody.\n\nAn official with TPDC said that confidentiality clauses in the deals prevent the state company from revealing them to third parties.\n\nExxonMobil, the minority partner in the venture, referred questions to Statoil. Knut Rostad, a spokesman for Statoil, said the deal was \u201cbalanced and comparable to commercial terms in other places with similar risks.\u201d He added that his company was making a long-term commitment to the country and has already spent <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over $1.5 billion</span> on exploration.\n\nBut Mr. Rostad said he wouldn\u2019t comment on parliamentary debates or police detention of TPDC executives. He confirmed his company didn\u2019t release the contracts but declined to answer why, given the demands of the Tanzanian parliament.\n\nWrite to Matina Stevis at matina.stevis@wsj.com and Nicholas Bariyo at nicholas.bariyo@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8", "displayed_text": "<h3>Tax Disputes Flare as Africa Fights \u2018Secret\u2019 Oil Deals</h3>From Guinea to Uganda, Clashes Slow Key Projects\n\nDec.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 15,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014 4</span>:43 pm ET\n\nSitting before a parliamentary oversight committee last month, two top executives from Tanzania Petroleum Development Corp. declined to reveal details of billions of dollars in gas contracts that the state company had signed with foreign investors.

They were briefly taken into custody, detained for a few hours and released without charges.\n\n\u201cCompanies must accept the era of secrecy is over,\u201d says Zitto Kabwe, the head of the Tanzanian parliament\u2019s public-accounts committee, who witnessed the scene.\n\nTPDC declined to comment on the police detention of its executives, and Tanzania\u2019s ministry of energy and minerals didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Battles over contract transparency are brewing across Africa, touching on sensitive tax issues among energy and mineral giants trying to tap into a new frontier of the global economy.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The clashes show how once-malleable African governments are fighting for a bigger share of earnings in sometimes-secretive deals, often following the advice of Western groups such as the Soros Foundation and the African Governance Initiative, which is headed by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\n</span>The upshot: A raft of legal disputes that have stalled production of some key projects and frayed relationships between African governments and foreign investors.\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Uganda remains embroiled in a litany of tax disputes with Tullow Oil PLC and Heritage Oil Corp., nearly a decade after oil reserves were discovered.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The country had amended its income-tax law to introduce a capital-gains tax on the sale of oil rights shortly after the discoveries, prompting Heritage and Tullow to contest the new tax assessments.\n\n</span>Zambia\u2019s mining industry is faltering after the government in October decided to more than triple mine royalties <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 20%,</span> following the advice of Western groups. This compelled miners such as First Quantum Minerals Ltd. and Glencore PLC to <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">suspend $2 billion</span> in expansion projects.\n\nAnd in Guinea, disputes stemming from government changes to a lease for the Simandou iron-ore mine are dogging the project.\n\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Some experts argue the disputes reveal a blurring between demands for more disclosure from investors and more tax revenue from governments.</span> \u201cIt\u2019s about negotiating to get a better deal in terms of money ... <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">income, but not necessarily transparency,\u201d says Carlos Lopes, the chief of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.\n\n</span>African governments have found ready partners for both endeavors. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Western organizations such as the Soros Foundation, founded by hedge-fund billionaire George Soros, and international institutions like the United Nations and the World Bank are providing advisory services to resource-rich nations on how to adjust ownership structures and rejigger tax laws for a bigger slice of revenues.\n\n</span>Some analysts say this is a necessary tilting of the scales toward African governments.\n\n\u201cThe deals often favor the companies which have access to vast experience and capital, while the governments do not have the experience, institutions or laws in place to manage their natural resources,\u201d says George Boden, an analyst with U.K.-based anticorruption group Global Witness.\n\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The African Governance Initiative\u2014headed by Mr. Blair\u2014has helped Rwanda become the region\u2019s first country to issue mining certificates at the point of export, in an effort to keep conflict minerals out of the supply chain.\n\n</span>In Guinea, Mr. Soros, through his foundations, played a key role in advising the government on its review of mining deals struck by previous governments. This led to the ouster of BSG Resources, the mining arm of Israeli tycoon Beny Steinmetz\u2019s family-owned conglomerate, from the country earlier this year and the ushering in of Rio Tinto PLC.\n\nMr. Steinmetz has since sued Global Witness\u2014partly funded by the Soros Foundation\u2014which accused his company of obtaining mining rights in the country through corruption. BSG also is in international arbitration with Guinea in a bid to win compensation for being stripped of the Simandou mine. BSG Resources has denied wrongdoing and accused President Alpha Cond\u00e9\u2019s government of seeking to expropriate its rights by stealth\u2014a claim the government rejects.\n\nSimandou\u2019s current operator Rio Tinto has also sued rival Vale SA and Mr. Steinmetz, alleging that they colluded to rob the Anglo-Australian company of the highly prized iron-ore concession, further complicating the legal battles around the mine. Both parties denied Rio Tinto\u2019s allegations, which a BSG Resources spokesman called \u201cbaseless and bizarre.\u201d\n\nIn Tanzania, the recent police detention of the oil-company executives capped months of a simmering row at the local parliament over whether the East African nation is getting a fair deal for its newfound vast natural-gas resources.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Mr. Kabwe\u2019s fight to make all contracts public kicked off in August, when part of the contract with Norway\u2019s Statoil ASA and ExxonMobil Corp. was leaked to the local press, showing that the state-run Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation, or TPDC, had agreed to terms yielding 30%-50% of the revenue for state coffers\u2014well below the 50%-80% yields recommended by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\n\n</span>Tanzania <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2009 signed</span> the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, an effort led by non-governmental organizations to bring contracts to light. Though most of Africa\u2019s other mineral-rich nations also are signatories, implementation has been uneven.\n\nMr. Kabwe, who heads the parliament\u2019s public-accounts committee, ordered TPDC to bring all contracts to parliament for scrutiny, but the state-run company cited investor reluctance to publicize the terms. It didn\u2019t comply with a Nov.<span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3 deadline</span>\u2014at which point the two senior TPDC board members were briefly taken into custody.\n\nAn official with TPDC said that confidentiality clauses in the deals prevent the state company from revealing them to third parties.\n\nExxonMobil, the minority partner in the venture, referred questions to Statoil. Knut Rostad, a spokesman for Statoil, said the deal was \u201cbalanced and comparable to commercial terms in other places with similar risks.\u201d He added that his company was making a long-term commitment to the country and has already spent <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over $1.5 billion</span> on exploration.\n\nBut Mr. Rostad said he wouldn\u2019t comment on parliamentary debates or police detention of TPDC executives. He confirmed his company didn\u2019t release the contracts but declined to answer why, given the demands of the Tanzanian parliament.\n\nWrite to Matina Stevis at matina.stevis@wsj.com and Nicholas Bariyo at nicholas.bariyo@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8"}, "58696": {"id": "58696", "text": "<h3>Amy Klobuchar Talks Health Care, Israel and, Yes, That Comb</h3>There was no real doubt what the first question to Senator Amy Klobuchar would be.\nBackstage at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., where Ms. Klobuchar was the first in a series of presidential candidates to be interviewed on Saturday, the interviewer, Kara Swisher, asked: \u201cDo you want to start with the comb or end with the comb?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to start with the comb,\u201d Ms. Swisher, the co-founder of the technology news website Recode and a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, concluded.\n\u201cThe comb\u201d was a reference to a February New York Times article about how Ms. Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, treats her staff in the Senate. <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2008,</span> The Times reported, an aide bought her a salad in an airport but fumbled the plastic utensils.

But she endorsed antitrust action and the breakup of monopolies broadly as \u201cone of the governing principles for ensuring that we have a capitalist system.\u201d\nMs. Warren also appeared at South by Southwest on Saturday, speaking with Anand Giridharadas of Time magazine. Mr. Giridharadas began the interview by telling everyone in the audience who either worked for or hoped to work for one of those tech giants to stand, and then asking Ms. Warren to explain to them why she wanted to break up their companies.\nPicking Amazon as her example, Ms. Warren condemned the ability of such giants to, essentially, play on a field they control. Amazon not only runs a marketplace, she said, but uses its vast trove of information about consumers\u2019 behavior in the marketplace to create and promote its own products.\n\u201cYou can be an umpire \u2014 a platform \u2014 or you can own teams. That\u2019s fine. But you can\u2019t be an umpire and own one of the teams that\u2019s in the game,\u201d she said. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cBreak those things apart and we will have a much more competitive, robust market in America.</span> That\u2019s how capitalism should work.\u201d\n\u201cThe monopolist will make fewer monopoly profits,\u201d she added. \u201cBoo-hoo.\u201d\nPressed on what this outlook said about her philosophical differences with Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running on a democratic socialist platform, Ms. Warren said she wanted capitalism to work better.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an enormous amount to be gained from markets,\u201d she said. \u201cBut markets have to have rules. They have to have a cop on the beat. Markets without rules are theft.\u201d\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">As in her stump speeches, Ms. Warren also spoke at length about the systemic effects of racism, especially in worsening economic inequality.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">In the 1960s, she noted, when redlining and other forms of housing discrimination were legal, the homeownership gap between black and white Americans <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 27 percentage</span> points.</span> Today, it <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 30 percentage</span> points.\n\u201cRace matters,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd until we say so and attack the problem head on, we are not going to fix it.\u201d\nFormer Gov. John Kasich of Ohio was also interviewed at the festival on Saturday, as was the Starbucks founder and possible independent presidential candidate Howard Schultz.\nMayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and former Gov.

But she endorsed antitrust action and the breakup of monopolies broadly as \u201cone of the governing principles for ensuring that we have a capitalist system.\u201d\nMs. Warren also appeared at South by Southwest on Saturday, speaking with Anand Giridharadas of Time magazine. Mr. Giridharadas began the interview by telling everyone in the audience who either worked for or hoped to work for one of those tech giants to stand, and then asking Ms. Warren to explain to them why she wanted to break up their companies.\nPicking Amazon as her example, Ms. Warren condemned the ability of such giants to, essentially, play on a field they control. Amazon not only runs a marketplace, she said, but uses its vast trove of information about consumers\u2019 behavior in the marketplace to create and promote its own products.\n\u201cYou can be an umpire \u2014 a platform \u2014 or you can own teams. That\u2019s fine. But you can\u2019t be an umpire and own one of the teams that\u2019s in the game,\u201d she said. <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cBreak those things apart and we will have a much more competitive, robust market in America.</span> That\u2019s how capitalism should work.\u201d\n\u201cThe monopolist will make fewer monopoly profits,\u201d she added. \u201cBoo-hoo.\u201d\nPressed on what this outlook said about her philosophical differences with Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running on a democratic socialist platform, Ms. Warren said she wanted capitalism to work better.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an enormous amount to be gained from markets,\u201d she said. \u201cBut markets have to have rules. They have to have a cop on the beat. Markets without rules are theft.\u201d\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">As in her stump speeches, Ms. Warren also spoke at length about the systemic effects of racism, especially in worsening economic inequality.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">In the 1960s, she noted, when redlining and other forms of housing discrimination were legal, the homeownership gap between black and white Americans <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 27 percentage</span> points.</span> Today, it <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 30 percentage</span> points.\n\u201cRace matters,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd until we say so and attack the problem head on, we are not going to fix it.\u201d\nFormer Gov. John Kasich of Ohio was also interviewed at the festival on Saturday, as was the Starbucks founder and possible independent presidential candidate Howard Schultz.\nMayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and former Gov. Bill Weld of Massachusetts, who is challenging Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination, were also on the schedule."}, "28411": {"id": "28411", "text": "<h3>Pinkerton: Why Buying Greenland Is One of Donald Trump\u2019s Best Ideas</h3>Last week, the Wall Street Journal had a scoop of sorts; the headline read, \u201cPresident Trump Eyes a New Real-Estate Purchase: Greenland: In conversations with aides, the president has \u2014 with varying degrees of seriousness \u2014 floated the idea of the U.S. buying the autonomous Danish territory.\u201d\nGreenland, of course, is a huge island in the Atlantic, most of it north of the Arctic Circle.

(We can pause to consider how much more difficult America\u2019s existence would have been, for example, if Napoleon had controlled the Mississippi River, or if the Russians had enjoyed a foothold in North America.)\nSo now, Greenland is a possible new frontier. The Danes have controlled it for centuries, and frankly, they haven\u2019t done much with it. One reason, of course, is that it\u2019s frigid and, indeed, mostly covered in glacier ice. And yet with the right mindset, inclement weather is only an obstacle, not a roadblock. As plucky Americans have proven in Alaska and elsewhere, we\u2019re perfectly capable of dealing with harsh weather; after all, ice, cold, and isolation are irresistible to hardy vacationers and those who simply wish to really get away from it all.\nMoreover, if profit beckons, miners and drillers can always punch their way through. And how much profit is to be had? The truth is, we really don\u2019t know how much natural wealth is to be found in Greenland because nobody has ever seriously looked.\nSo why haven\u2019t they looked? It\u2019s because the Danes have chosen to treat the territory, for the most part, like a giant nature preserve. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">And that\u2019s why the native population of Greenland mostly lives in relative poverty as poor dependents of the masters in Copenhagen.</span> Yes, it\u2019s an odd kind of neocolonialism there in the North Atlantic as the politically correct Danes pat themselves on the back for their \u201cenlightened eco-consciousness,\u201d even as Greenlanders stay poor.\nYet even from afar, we know that Greenland offers a fantastic development opportunity. And so, if the Danes are too green and politically correct to extract that wealth, perhaps the U.S. can blaze a rich new trail.\nOf course, some will say that all this is a pipe-dream, even if the U.S. were to become sovereign in Greenland. That is, the greens in America would work just as hard as the greens in Denmark to stop any such development, preferring to leave Greenland as it is, undeveloped. Yes, American greens, backed up by numerous billion-dollar foundations, would do precisely that: They\u2019d organize, agitate, and litigate to leave Greenland to the seals and polar bears.\nSo we can see: Green power is not to be underestimated. As a matter of fact, the greens are so powerful in the U.S. that they have, in much of the country, taken the issue of natural resource development off the table. That\u2019s why, for example, efforts to fully exploit America\u2019s hydrocarbon resources have been stymied. As has been pointed out by Breitbart News, the total value of oil and natural gas, under federal lands and waters, <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is $128 trillion</span>. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s a lot of wealth \u2014 six times America\u2019s annual GDP, six times our national debt \u2014 and yet green power is such that few even talk about tapping into our natural abundance.\n</span>So if Greenland were on the agenda, we could at least ask: What\u2019s the value of underground resources in Greenland? And the answer is, simply, nobody knows. And yet we should be confident that the number is, well, yuge.\nThere\u2019s a good reason \u2014 a cosmic reason, one might say \u2014 why we should be confident that there are plenty of resources to be found in Greenland. And that\u2019s because valuable elements, and the resulting compounds and minerals, have been scattered all over the earth by the same gargantuan forces that created the universe in the first place. That is, all the naturally occurring elements in the periodic table \u2014 from copper to iron, from silver to gold \u2014 were created by nucleosynthesis, either as the result of the Big Bang eons ago or by subsequent stellar activity. All that nucleosynthesis has had the effect of hurling gases and matter around the universe until some of it was accreted into celestial bodies, such as our sun and its planets \u2014 and including our earth.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">So that\u2019s why raw resources are both so abundant and so widely distributed here on this third rock from the sun; as Charlton Heston might have thundered at his Ten Commandments best, we can behold the mighty hands of God that have whipped treasures all around the globe, including in Greenland.\n</span>Now here\u2019s where human mind-power comes into the equation. All through human history, smart and hard-working people have unlocked value from seemingly barren patches of land; that is, they have learned to find, refine, and otherwise gain the riches of the earth. That was the story, for example, of Texas and Oklahoma, a century or more ago: tumbleweeds turned into oil rigs.\nIndeed, ever since, the smart and the hard-working have found yet more ways to find additional oil and other hydrocarbons. In doing so, they have the defied most \u201cexperts.\u201d You see, back in the early 1970s, savants opined that the world was in the midst of an \u201cenergy crisis,\u201d and so we had to cut back on everything and live with less.\nYet in the decades since, in defiance of those brainiacs, we have proven that there was no such natural energy crisis. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The biggest problem was the unnatural imposition of U.S. price controls, finally lifted by President Ronald Reagan <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1981.</span></span> After Reagan de-controlled oil, its production surged. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Indeed, it surged so much that prices actually fell.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">In other words, the free market delivered an unabashed win-win: more production and lower prices.\n</span>In the meantime, a whole new group of entrepreneurs and innovators came along, finding new ways to squeeze oil out of old fields; one such was George P. Mitchell (1919-2013), the Texas-born pioneer of fracking. As a result, <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1980,</span> proven oil reserves in the U.S. have risen by more than a third, and around the world, reserves have nearly tripled.\nSo now, looking to the future, there\u2019s every reason to believe that the same sequence would happen in Greenland: new thinking + new production = new wealth.\nOf course, the greens would oppose all of this. They would say that they are worried about the puffins, of course, and they would also say they\u2019re worried about climate change. That is, if we extracted and burned more carbon-based fuels, more carbon dioxide would enter into the atmosphere.\nYet seen through the proper prism of informed imagination, Greenland offers great hope for addressing that issue as well. That is, if the concern is that too much carbon dioxide is entering the atmosphere, there\u2019s a simple enough thing to do: capture it. After all, if it was put into the atmosphere, it can be pulled out.\nSo how, exactly, to pull out the CO2? That can be done in lots of ways, including direct-air capture, as advocated by Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY). And there\u2019s the related, perhaps simpler, idea of planting a lot of trees \u2014 call that organic carbon capture.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">As this author has argued here at Breitbart News, carbon capture by any means \u2014 industrial or biological \u2014 would be a powerful engine of rural economic development.\n</span>So now we come back to Greenland. As noted, Greenland is more than a quarter the size of the <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Lower 48.</span> So that gives us plenty of vacant land to work with \u2014 to dig, to drill, to otherwise enjoy \u2014 and then, at the same time, the land can be used for carbon capture. Yes, it\u2019s mostly ice, and yet useful things can be built on top of ice. And carbon could be the key ingredient.\nAfter all, thanks to its marvelous bonding properties, carbon is the building block of just about everything, and so if we use our brains, we can figure out how to solidify carbon to make new structures \u2014 applying, for instance, 3-D printing to the construction of homes, towns, even whole cities. Heck, if we wanted to, we could make a carbon-nanotube space elevator; now that would be the world\u2019s coolest carbon sink.\nAnd if we need energy in Greenland, and we don\u2019t find it in carbon fuels, we would have plenty of other options \u2014 if we keep our minds open. For instance, one visionary has suggested creating energy from moving weights around to power generators, and those weights could even be made of ice. (And if the ice melts, carbon capture might help restore the ice.)\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">By this reckoning, Greenland could be just the beginning of a whole new worldwide economic boom.</span> If we can develop that icy island, then there\u2019s the rest of the Arctic, and also the Antarctic. And come to think of it, closer to home, there\u2019s all the un-utilized land in the U.S.; the federal government <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">owns 28 percent</span> of all our territory. We need never touch the Grand Canyon or other precious parks; instead, we can start with <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 61 percent</span> of Alaska that the feds are sitting on.\nSo let\u2019s give Trump credit for his Greenland idea. Even if nothing comes of it during his presidency, he has expanded the \u201cOverton Window\u201d \u2014 that is, the range of acceptable political discourse \u2014 reminding us that greatness comes from expansion and innovation, not from contraction and enervation.\nOne fine day, development will come to Greenland, as well as to other desolate places. Such development can, and should, be done cleanly as well as profitably.\nThere may never be a Trump Tower in Greenland. But even so, the MAGA spirit could be extended to include the new phrase, MGGA \u2014 Make Greenland Great Again.\n.\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.", "displayed_text": "<h3>Pinkerton: Why Buying Greenland Is One of Donald Trump\u2019s Best Ideas</h3>Last week, the Wall Street Journal had a scoop of sorts; the headline read, \u201cPresident Trump Eyes a New Real-Estate Purchase: Greenland: In conversations with aides, the president has \u2014 with varying degrees of seriousness \u2014 floated the idea of the U.S. buying the autonomous Danish territory.\u201d\nGreenland, of course, is a huge island in the Atlantic, most of it north of the Arctic Circle.

And carbon could be the key ingredient.\nAfter all, thanks to its marvelous bonding properties, carbon is the building block of just about everything, and so if we use our brains, we can figure out how to solidify carbon to make new structures \u2014 applying, for instance, 3-D printing to the construction of homes, towns, even whole cities. Heck, if we wanted to, we could make a carbon-nanotube space elevator; now that would be the world\u2019s coolest carbon sink.\nAnd if we need energy in Greenland, and we don\u2019t find it in carbon fuels, we would have plenty of other options \u2014 if we keep our minds open. For instance, one visionary has suggested creating energy from moving weights around to power generators, and those weights could even be made of ice. (And if the ice melts, carbon capture might help restore the ice.)\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">By this reckoning, Greenland could be just the beginning of a whole new worldwide economic boom.</span> If we can develop that icy island, then there\u2019s the rest of the Arctic, and also the Antarctic. And come to think of it, closer to home, there\u2019s all the un-utilized land in the U.S.; the federal government <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">owns 28 percent</span> of all our territory. We need never touch the Grand Canyon or other precious parks; instead, we can start with <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 61 percent</span> of Alaska that the feds are sitting on.\nSo let\u2019s give Trump credit for his Greenland idea. Even if nothing comes of it during his presidency, he has expanded the \u201cOverton Window\u201d \u2014 that is, the range of acceptable political discourse \u2014 reminding us that greatness comes from expansion and innovation, not from contraction and enervation.\nOne fine day, development will come to Greenland, as well as to other desolate places. Such development can, and should, be done cleanly as well as profitably.\nThere may never be a Trump Tower in Greenland. But even so, the MAGA spirit could be extended to include the new phrase, MGGA \u2014 Make Greenland Great Again.\n.\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting."}, "87347": {"id": "87347", "text": "<h3>U.S. Consumer Prices Increase at Fastest Annual Rate Since 2012</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">U.S. Consumer Prices Increase at Fastest Annual Rate Since 2012\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">For the second month in a row, annual inflation fully offset workers\u2019 average hourly wage growth\nWASHINGTON\u2014U.S. consumer prices rose for a third straight month in June, eating away at sluggish wage growth and sending inflation to its highest rate in more than six years.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The consumer-price index, which gauges what Americans pay for everything from veterinarian services to baby clothes, rose a seasonally <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">adjusted 0.1% in</span> June from the prior month, the Labor Department said Thursday.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Excluding volatile food and energy components, prices <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">increased 0.2%.</span></span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 0.2% uptick</span>...\nMost Popular Videos\nMost Popular Articles\n-\nChina Seeks Ways to Retaliate After U.S. Plans New Tariffs\n-\nCroatia Stuns England in Extra Time to Advance to World Cup Final\n-\nStolen Military Drone Documents Found for Sale on Dark Web\n-\nTrump Urges NATO to Double Military-Spending Target <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 4% of</span> GDP\n-\nThai Cave Rescue, Before Its Triumph, Teetered on the Brink of Disaster</span>", "displayed_text": "<h3>U.S. Consumer Prices Increase at Fastest Annual Rate Since 2012</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">U.S. Consumer Prices Increase at Fastest Annual Rate Since 2012\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">For the second month in a row, annual inflation fully offset workers\u2019 average hourly wage growth\nWASHINGTON\u2014U.S. consumer prices rose for a third straight month in June, eating away at sluggish wage growth and sending inflation to its highest rate in more than six years.\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The consumer-price index, which gauges what Americans pay for everything from veterinarian services to baby clothes, rose a seasonally <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">adjusted 0.1% in</span> June from the prior month, the Labor Department said Thursday.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Excluding volatile food and energy components, prices <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">increased 0.2%.</span></span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 0.2% uptick</span>...\nMost Popular Videos\nMost Popular Articles\n-\nChina Seeks Ways to Retaliate After U.S. Plans New Tariffs\n-\nCroatia Stuns England in Extra Time to Advance to World Cup Final\n-\nStolen Military Drone Documents Found for Sale on Dark Web\n-\nTrump Urges NATO to Double Military-Spending Target <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 4% of</span> GDP\n-\nThai Cave Rescue, Before Its Triumph, Teetered on the Brink of Disaster</span>"}, "64541": {"id": "64541", "text": "<h3>Hackers Swipe More Than $40 Million of Bitcoin From Cryptocurrency Exchange</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Price of bitcoin and other digital currencies barely budged after the robbery was disclosed\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 8,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019 2</span>:27 am ET\n\nBinance, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, said hackers stole more <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $40 million</span> worth of bitcoin from its platform in what it called a \u201clarge scale security breach.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The theft offers another example of the vulnerability facing cryptocurrencies and the venues where investors trade them.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Yet the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies barely budged after the robbery was disclosed Wednesday morning in Asia.\n\n</span>Binance said it discovered Tuesday <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 7,000 bitcoins</span> were stolen from a single wallet, amounting to <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 2% of</span> the company\u2019s total bitcoin holdings.\n\nHackers used phishing, viruses and other techniques, the company said.

But then things changed.\nSupported by\nReal-world ethics question: In a well-used city park, a man with a history of erratic behavior attacks a dog and its owner with a stick; five days later, the dog dies. The man is Black, the dog owner white; the adjoining neighborhood is famously progressive, often critical of the police and jail system. At the same time, crime is up in the neighborhood, with attacks by emotionally disturbed people around the city putting some residents on edge.\nIn a dog-loving, progressive enclave, where pushing law and order can clash with calls for social justice, what\u2019s the right thing to do? How do you protect the public without furthering injustice against this man?\nHere\u2019s what happened in Park Slope, Brooklyn, when real-life residents faced this situation.\nOn Aug.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3,</span> Jessica Chrustic,<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 40,</span> a professional beekeeper, was walking her dog in Prospect Park a little <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 6 a</span>.m. when she saw a man rifling through the garbage outside the Picnic House. She had seen the man before \u2014 tall, with dreadlocks wrapped in a turban, carrying a long staff and often muttering to himself or cursing \u2014 and she usually kept her distance. But this morning there was no room to avoid him.\nAccording to Ms. Chrustic, he started yelling about immigrants taking over the park, then grabbed a bottle of what she later concluded was urine and sloshed it at her and her dog. She tried to run away, but Moose, her 80-pound golden retriever mix, was straining toward the man, trying to protect her.\nThe man started swinging the stick, she said. One blow hit her, not seriously. Another connected solidly with the dog\u2019s snout. Mary Rowland,<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 56,</span> a hospital manager who was walking her dog nearby, said she heard the crack of wood on bone and came running toward them, screaming at the man to get away.\nBoth women <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">called 911,</span> and four patrol cars arrived within a few minutes. But by then, the man was gone. \u201cMoose was bleeding from his mouth and pulling to get home,\u201d Ms. Chrustic said. \u201cMy focus was just on caring for him.\u201d\nMs. Chrustic was physically unhurt, but she was shaken. How could this happen in a park where she had never felt unsafe, even walking her dog late at night?\nMoose had a shattered tooth that needed to be pulled. Ms. Chrustic posted a description of the encounter on the neighborhood social network Nextdoor, warning others about the man and asking them to report any sightings to the police. Her post elicited more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 280 comments</span> in the coming weeks, mostly expressing sympathy. A total stranger on the forum offered to make her a bracelet with the name Moose on it.\nBut then the next weekend, Moose developed sepsis from a perforated intestine, caused by a blow Ms. Chrustic had not noticed. After emergency surgery, Moose died.\nWeeks passed, and the man who attacked the dog was still at large. People on Nextdoor, working from Ms. Chrustic\u2019s description, posted that they had seen him in one part of the park or another. Ms. Chrustic, who used to visit the park four times a day, now found it too traumatic to enter unless necessary.\nShe was especially frustrated that the man, who was well known to people in the park, had not been arrested. \u201cYou have a person who is walking around the park who is violent and needs to be removed,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s known by the community. It\u2019s disheartening.\u201d\nIt was a random incident that might once have been discussed by a group of dog owners. But now it had a forum for a much wider community, with arguments about policing, vigilantism, homelessness, mental health care and progressive obstinacy all feeding into a conversation that evolved beyond the crime that set it off.\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d said S. Matthew Liao, a professor of bioethics, philosophy and public health at New York University. \u201cIt\u2019s a conflict of values, between wanting security and social justice. Everybody has a responsibility in some ways.\n\u201cThere are a bunch of issues here, a bunch of threats,\u201d he added. \u201cWe can deal with them in a compassionate way, or a not compassionate way.\u201d\nThe Nextdoor effect\nNextdoor, which claims an average <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 37 million</span> users per week, started <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2010 with</span> the promise of connecting people with their neighbors and neighborhoods. One slogan went, \u201cWhen neighbors start talking, good things happen.\u201d\nOne thing they talked about, a lot, was local crime. In Nextdoor forums for communities all over the country, this included suspected crime and sightings of \u201csuspicious\u201d characters, leading early critics to say that what the platform really propagated was white fear. After complaints about racial profiling <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2016,</span> the company instituted diversity training for its operations staff and new protocols for posts about crime and safety. But even <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020,</span></span> Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez characterized it as an outlet for privileged white people to vent criminal fantasies about their Black and brown neighbors. She tweeted, \u201c@Nextdoor needs to publicly deal w/ their Karen problem.\u201d\nA Nextdoor spokesperson said the company enables users to report any posts that they find offensive or discriminatory, which are then reviewed by volunteer community moderators or staff members. <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2021,</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 1 percent</span> of posts were reported as hurtful or harmful; about half of these were removed.\nWhen Ms. Chrustic posted about the attack, the first responses were mostly notes of condolence and support. People with dogs posted that they had seen the man in the same area where she was attacked \u2014 why weren\u2019t the police arresting him? Donations poured in to offset her veterinary bills.\nBut gradually, other voices emerged. A vocal minority asked why Park Slope residents, mostly white, were calling for the police to take down a man who appeared to be homeless and emotionally disturbed. Others called the man a \u201cmonster,\u201d a \u201cpredator\u201d or a \u201cpsychopath.\u201d As on other social media platforms, the most ardent voices made the most noise.\nMartin Lofsnes,<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 52,</span> a dancer and choreographer who moved out of the neighborhood <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2020,</span></span> came across the conversation while trying to sell some stuff and was appalled by the vitriol directed at an impoverished man, and by what he called \u201cthis vigilante attitude.\u201d\nHe urged people on the thread to put their emotions aside and consider \u201c400 yrs of systematic racism which has prevented black people from building generational wealth through homeownership resulting in the extreme disparity we see today.\u201d Arresting the man, he wrote, would solve none of that.\nWith all the affluence in Park Slope, he posted, maybe critics should raise money to help the man, not throw him to the lethal jail system, from which he would most likely emerge more dangerous, or not emerge at all.\nOthers called Mr. Lofsnes na\u00efve or accused him of mansplaining, or told him to take his comments to another thread.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say that you\u2019re for prison reform and you\u2019re a liberal, until it happens to you,\u201d Mr. Lofsnes said in an interview. \u201cWhen it happens to you, you have to deal with it. You have to take a step back, even in that heated situation where her dog died, and say, \u2018What does this do in the larger scheme of things?\u2019\u201d\nTo Ms. Chrustic and many on Nextdoor, the issue was simple: A man who killed a dog and attacked its owner was a risk to everyone. She asked people who saw the man to <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">call 911 and</span> to send her photographs so she could confirm that it was really him.\nThough most people on the site were supportive, some of the commentary and messages disturbed her. She was accused of not cooperating with the police; some suggested that she did not deserve a dog because she had not protected hers. \u201cPeople can be horrible,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd people also take it as an opportunity to vent. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">It becomes a politically divisive conversation I have no interest in being a part of.\u201d\n</span>She worked with a police artist to create a sketch of the man, even though part of his face had been covered during the attack. The sketch went up on Nextdoor, and police officers posted it in the park, prompting more reports of sightings.\nFor Nicole Haddad, who stopped going to the park with her pitbull-vizsla mix, Kingsley, after he was the victim of a similar attack three years ago, Ms. Chrustic\u2019s posts hit home. Since then, Ms. Haddad said, Kingsley has been fearful and sometimes aggressive and has needed expensive behavioral specialists and anti-anxiety medication.\n\u201cWhen I read Jessica\u2019s post, I got really, really triggered,\u201d she said. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">\u201cI just knew the journey that Jessica was going to be in for, because it\u2019s caused me emotional and financial duress.</span> I reached out to her immediately.\u201d The two women compared information and concluded that their dogs were attacked by the same man. To the people who focused more on social justice than removing a threat, Ms. Haddad said: \u201cI tell those people to shut up. They don\u2019t have a leg to stand on.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care that it\u2019s being divisive, and that people don\u2019t want to see this guy die in Rikers Island,\u201d Ms. Haddad added. \u201cI\u2019m a New York liberal. I am absolutely for people getting the help they need. But this person is attacking people and killing dogs. He\u2019s targeting women and dogs. He\u2019s violent. He should not be in the park. He should be locked up and paying for his actions.\u201d\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Don\u2019t be a cop, Kris\nKristian Nammack,<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 59,</span> who works in sustainable financing, read the Moose posts on Nextdoor and grew frustrated that nothing seemed to be happening.</span> So he decided to do something about it. He invited people on Nextdoor and Meetup to form a neighborhood watch group to \u201ctake our neighborhood back.\u201d As an enticement, he created a logo and <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">printed 10 T</span>-shirts. \u201cWe may also get to wear cool berets,\u201d his solicitation offered, nodding to the Guardian Angels, an anti-crime \u201csafety patrol\u201d prominent in the \u201970s and \u201980s.\nMr. Nammack\u2019s name for the new group: Park Slope Panthers.\nHe did not see the backlash coming.\n\u201cIn my mind it was getting people to provide some visibility of community members in the park, especially at hours when women feel vulnerable, <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">like 6 to</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 9,</span>\u201d he said. \u201cNot vigilantes, not with guns, not with the intention to tackle an attacker, but just to be another physical presence. I think just a presence deters crime.\u201d\nMr. Nammack, who was involved in ACT UP and Occupy Sandy, presents himself as a soft-spoken voice of reason, with a Quaker background and a longstanding commitment to progressive causes. He was surprised suddenly to be embraced by people to the right of him. He said he was invited to appear on \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d and to meet with Curtis Sliwa, the Guardian Angels founder who ran a tough-on-crime campaign for mayor. Flustered, he declined both.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Then there was the group\u2019s name, which was an immediate flash point: a white financial services guy using the Panther name to take action against a Black man.</span> At the group\u2019s first and only meeting, the scattering of potential volunteers was met by a group of four people, all white, who showed up to disrupt the proceedings.\nAs described in the news site Hell Gate and the newsletter Common Sense, things went awry almost from the start. A man calling himself Snow told the group, \u201cWe are super not into you guys having your meeting, or doing anything in the park,\u201d according to Hell Gate. \u201cThe opposite of what we need right now is more cops in this park and more people who want to be helping the cops in this park, when people are already being, like, chased down by the cops.\u201d\nTo the delight of people who enjoy making fun of Park Slope liberals, one of the disrupters, a woman calling herself Sky, said, \u201cCrime is an abstract term that means nothing in a lot of ways,\u201d according to Common Sense.\nA few days after the meeting, someone spray-painted the sidewalk outside Mr. Nammack\u2019s apartment: \u201cDon\u2019t Be a Cop, Kris.\u201d It rattled him. \u201cEven being gay, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever been the target of hate,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt that I was the target of hate.\u201d He decided he did not have the time or energy to continue the group.\nOn Nextdoor, people seemed to be dug into their positions. Many bundled the lack of an arrest with the rise of other crimes in the neighborhood. Serious crimes in the 78th Precinct, which includes Park Slope, are <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 50 percent</span> from two years ago, though well below the highs of the early 1990s.\nA spokesperson for the Police Department said they were conducting canvasses of the park but would not comment on why there had been no arrest. At a virtual town meeting, Capt. Frantz Souffrant noted that numerous people in the area wear dreadlocks and carry staves. Ms. Rowland \u2014 the woman who witnessed the assault \u2014 went on at least three rides with officers to confirm a sighting. Each time the person was gone, or it was the wrong man.\nBoth Ms. Chrustic and Mr. Nammack separately appealed to their representative on the City Council, Shahana Hanif, for help, but they came away feeling her staff members were more concerned with the safety of the man \u2014 whom they presumed to be homeless and mentally ill \u2014 than with the threat he might pose to others.\nMr. Nammack said he was told: \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t want the police involved in this.\u2019\u201d He said, \u201cThey didn\u2019t seem concerned that there was a public safety threat with this man at large, and that he needs to be dealt with. The bigger concern was keeping this man out of Rikers, and let\u2019s not do anything.\u201d\nUnder New York law, depending on the level of cruelty, killing a dog can be a misdemeanor or a felony, carrying a prison sentence of up to two years. Michael Whitesides, a spokesperson for Ms. Hanif, called the situation complicated. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that the N.Y.P.D. is the vehicle to bring safety to our community,\u201d Mx. Whitesides said. \u201cWhen it comes to this individual, they\u2019re clearly a present danger to others and most likely themselves, and figuring out how we can safely de-escalate that situation without putting anyone else in danger is complicated.\u201d\nThe debate, Mx. Whitesides said, was simply what happens when progressive priorities clash. \u201cEven among the progressives, everyone wants to be safe,\u201d they said. \u201cThese debates in the community, while they can feel very tense \u2014 this is how we find a solution. It\u2019s going to come through neighbors talking to neighbors.\u201d\nCan you support social justice and the police?\nOn a recent afternoon, nearly two months after the attack, the park was a 526-acre sanctuary from social media and liberal hand-wringing, its tree-lined paths and open fields indifferent to the disputations among its users. Schoolchildren, let out into the exquisite early fall afternoon, fanned excitedly over the gently sloping lawn, as a police cruiser idled nearby, its misery lights flashing. The park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who designed Central Park, both connects and separates the disparate neighborhoods around it.\nMs. Chrustic was willing to talk on a bench outside the park, but not to enter within. Like Mr. Nammack, she felt compelled to stress her progressive bona fides, including volunteer work she\u2019d done for homeless organizations. She wore the M-O-O-S-E bracelet given to her through Nextdoor. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t even wear bracelets usually,\u201d she said.\nShe said she still had not moved Moose\u2019s bed or food bowls in her apartment.\n\u201cI\u2019m very empathetic toward people who are unhoused and are having hard times and who have mental illness,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that there should be more resources for them. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">There should be more housing situations.</span> But what I emphasize is that this is just one person who needs to be removed from the park. He\u2019s violent. End of story.\u201d\nFor two months, she has grown increasingly impatient with the police, local officials and neighbors on Nextdoor who seemed more concerned about her attacker\u2019s welfare than her safety.\n\u201cAre they waiting for somebody to die?\u201d she said. \u201cAre they waiting for someone to get hurt more severely? I was lucky. My dog was not. What happens to the next person? What happens if it\u2019s a child? How many more people need to be harmed?\u201d\nMr. Nammack, for his part, had come to see his failed effort to start a community watch group, and the disastrous meetup, as a successful exercise in democracy. He had solicited a range of viewpoints, and he got them. \u201cThe Saturday meeting, looking back, it was great,\u201d he said. \u201cIt brought up a lot of issues. It was quite diverse. It left more open questions than answers. They\u2019re all good questions, but I don\u2019t have the bandwidth to answer. So I feel like I opened a can of worms, and I\u2019m walking away from it.\u201d\nFor now, he was urging people to sign a petition on Change.org, demanding that Mayor Eric Adams \u201ctake appropriate action to rectify this matter.\u201d More <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 600 people</span> have signed the petition.\nBut Mr. Nammack was not done. After a brief ban from Nextdoor, which was never explained, he returned to the fray. Once again he posted the police sketch of Ms. Chrustic\u2019s attacker, above the headline: STILL AT LARGE. PROSPECT PARK VAGRANT. VIOLENT AND SOCIOPATHIC.\nTwenty-seven people clicked that they liked the post. Then Mr. Nammack\u2019s posts were removed again.\nAdvertisement", "displayed_text": "<h3>How a Dog\u2019s Killing Turned Brooklyn Progressives Against One Another</h3>The Great Read\nHow a Dog\u2019s Killing Turned Brooklyn Progressives Against One Another\nAfter a sudden confrontation that left a golden retriever dead, neighbors came together online to support the owner of the dog. But then things changed.\nSupported by\nReal-world ethics question: In a well-used city park, a man with a history of erratic behavior attacks a dog and its owner with a stick; five days later, the dog dies. The man is Black, the dog owner white; the adjoining neighborhood is famously progressive, often critical of the police and jail system. At the same time, crime is up in the neighborhood, with attacks by emotionally disturbed people around the city putting some residents on edge.\nIn a dog-loving, progressive enclave, where pushing law and order can clash with calls for social justice, what\u2019s the right thing to do? How do you protect the public without furthering injustice against this man?\nHere\u2019s what happened in Park Slope, Brooklyn, when real-life residents faced this situation.\nOn Aug.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3,</span> Jessica Chrustic,<span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 40,</span> a professional beekeeper, was walking her dog in Prospect Park a little <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 6 a</span>.m. when she saw a man rifling through the garbage outside the Picnic House. She had seen the man before \u2014 tall, with dreadlocks wrapped in a turban, carrying a long staff and often muttering to himself or cursing \u2014 and she usually kept her distance. But this morning there was no room to avoid him.\nAccording to Ms. Chrustic, he started yelling about immigrants taking over the park, then grabbed a bottle of what she later concluded was urine and sloshed it at her and her dog. She tried to run away, but Moose, her 80-pound golden retriever mix, was straining toward the man, trying to protect her.\nThe man started swinging the stick, she said.

He invited people on Nextdoor and Meetup to form a neighborhood watch group to \u201ctake our neighborhood back.\u201d As an enticement, he created a logo and <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">printed 10 T</span>-shirts. \u201cWe may also get to wear cool berets,\u201d his solicitation offered, nodding to the Guardian Angels, an anti-crime \u201csafety patrol\u201d prominent in the \u201970s and \u201980s.\nMr. Nammack\u2019s name for the new group: Park Slope Panthers.\nHe did not see the backlash coming.\n\u201cIn my mind it was getting people to provide some visibility of community members in the park, especially at hours when women feel vulnerable, <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">like 6 to</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 9,</span>\u201d he said. \u201cNot vigilantes, not with guns, not with the intention to tackle an attacker, but just to be another physical presence. I think just a presence deters crime.\u201d\nMr. Nammack, who was involved in ACT UP and Occupy Sandy, presents himself as a soft-spoken voice of reason, with a Quaker background and a longstanding commitment to progressive causes. He was surprised suddenly to be embraced by people to the right of him. He said he was invited to appear on \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d and to meet with Curtis Sliwa, the Guardian Angels founder who ran a tough-on-crime campaign for mayor. Flustered, he declined both.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Then there was the group\u2019s name, which was an immediate flash point: a white financial services guy using the Panther name to take action against a Black man.</span> At the group\u2019s first and only meeting, the scattering of potential volunteers was met by a group of four people, all white, who showed up to disrupt the proceedings.\nAs described in the news site Hell Gate and the newsletter Common Sense, things went awry almost from the start. A man calling himself Snow told the group, \u201cWe are super not into you guys having your meeting, or doing anything in the park,\u201d according to Hell Gate. \u201cThe opposite of what we need right now is more cops in this park and more people who want to be helping the cops in this park, when people are already being, like, chased down by the cops.\u201d\nTo the delight of people who enjoy making fun of Park Slope liberals, one of the disrupters, a woman calling herself Sky, said, \u201cCrime is an abstract term that means nothing in a lot of ways,\u201d according to Common Sense.\nA few days after the meeting, someone spray-painted the sidewalk outside Mr. Nammack\u2019s apartment: \u201cDon\u2019t Be a Cop, Kris.\u201d It rattled him. \u201cEven being gay, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever been the target of hate,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt that I was the target of hate.\u201d He decided he did not have the time or energy to continue the group.\nOn Nextdoor, people seemed to be dug into their positions. Many bundled the lack of an arrest with the rise of other crimes in the neighborhood. Serious crimes in the 78th Precinct, which includes Park Slope, are <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 50 percent</span> from two years ago, though well below the highs of the early 1990s.\nA spokesperson for the Police Department said they were conducting canvasses of the park but would not comment on why there had been no arrest. At a virtual town meeting, Capt. Frantz Souffrant noted that numerous people in the area wear dreadlocks and carry staves. Ms. Rowland \u2014 the woman who witnessed the assault \u2014 went on at least three rides with officers to confirm a sighting. Each time the person was gone, or it was the wrong man.\nBoth Ms. Chrustic and Mr. Nammack separately appealed to their representative on the City Council, Shahana Hanif, for help, but they came away feeling her staff members were more concerned with the safety of the man \u2014 whom they presumed to be homeless and mentally ill \u2014 than with the threat he might pose to others.\nMr. Nammack said he was told: \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t want the police involved in this.\u2019\u201d He said, \u201cThey didn\u2019t seem concerned that there was a public safety threat with this man at large, and that he needs to be dealt with. The bigger concern was keeping this man out of Rikers, and let\u2019s not do anything.\u201d\nUnder New York law, depending on the level of cruelty, killing a dog can be a misdemeanor or a felony, carrying a prison sentence of up to two years. Michael Whitesides, a spokesperson for Ms. Hanif, called the situation complicated. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that the N.Y.P.D. is the vehicle to bring safety to our community,\u201d Mx. Whitesides said. \u201cWhen it comes to this individual, they\u2019re clearly a present danger to others and most likely themselves, and figuring out how we can safely de-escalate that situation without putting anyone else in danger is complicated.\u201d\nThe debate, Mx. Whitesides said, was simply what happens when progressive priorities clash. \u201cEven among the progressives, everyone wants to be safe,\u201d they said. \u201cThese debates in the community, while they can feel very tense \u2014 this is how we find a solution. It\u2019s going to come through neighbors talking to neighbors.\u201d\nCan you support social justice and the police?\nOn a recent afternoon, nearly two months after the attack, the park was a 526-acre sanctuary from social media and liberal hand-wringing, its tree-lined paths and open fields indifferent to the disputations among its users. Schoolchildren, let out into the exquisite early fall afternoon, fanned excitedly over the gently sloping lawn, as a police cruiser idled nearby, its misery lights flashing. The park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who designed Central Park, both connects and separates the disparate neighborhoods around it.\nMs. Chrustic was willing to talk on a bench outside the park, but not to enter within. Like Mr. Nammack, she felt compelled to stress her progressive bona fides, including volunteer work she\u2019d done for homeless organizations. She wore the M-O-O-S-E bracelet given to her through Nextdoor. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t even wear bracelets usually,\u201d she said.\nShe said she still had not moved Moose\u2019s bed or food bowls in her apartment.\n\u201cI\u2019m very empathetic toward people who are unhoused and are having hard times and who have mental illness,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that there should be more resources for them. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">There should be more housing situations.</span> But what I emphasize is that this is just one person who needs to be removed from the park. He\u2019s violent. End of story.\u201d\nFor two months, she has grown increasingly impatient with the police, local officials and neighbors on Nextdoor who seemed more concerned about her attacker\u2019s welfare than her safety.\n\u201cAre they waiting for somebody to die?\u201d she said. \u201cAre they waiting for someone to get hurt more severely? I was lucky. My dog was not. What happens to the next person? What happens if it\u2019s a child? How many more people need to be harmed?\u201d\nMr. Nammack, for his part, had come to see his failed effort to start a community watch group, and the disastrous meetup, as a successful exercise in democracy. He had solicited a range of viewpoints, and he got them. \u201cThe Saturday meeting, looking back, it was great,\u201d he said. \u201cIt brought up a lot of issues. It was quite diverse. It left more open questions than answers. They\u2019re all good questions, but I don\u2019t have the bandwidth to answer. So I feel like I opened a can of worms, and I\u2019m walking away from it.\u201d\nFor now, he was urging people to sign a petition on Change.org, demanding that Mayor Eric Adams \u201ctake appropriate action to rectify this matter.\u201d More <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 600 people</span> have signed the petition.\nBut Mr. Nammack was not done. After a brief ban from Nextdoor, which was never explained, he returned to the fray. Once again he posted the police sketch of Ms. Chrustic\u2019s attacker, above the headline: STILL AT LARGE. PROSPECT PARK VAGRANT. VIOLENT AND SOCIOPATHIC.\nTwenty-seven people clicked that they liked the post. Then Mr. Nammack\u2019s posts were removed again.\nAdvertisement"}, "49862": {"id": "49862", "text": "<h3>Analysis | AT&T\u2019s ill-fated media play cost it both time and money</h3>AT&T today is a

percent</span> of the new Discovery, so they will benefit from its future growth. <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But many current AT&T investors didn\u2019t sign up for the often bumpy ride of a media

id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The stock is going to be a lot less attractive to that class of individual investors,\u201d said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, senior counselor at the nonprofit Benton Institute for Broadband and Society.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">One sign of how widely felt AT&T\u2019s cut will be: The Vanguard Group, which holds the company\u2019s shares in dozens of its mutual funds, including the Total Stock Market Index Fund, the world\u2019s largest single fund, is the company\u2019s top shareholder.\n</span>By AT&T\u2019s calculations, it\u2019s already made billions of dollars on its original Time Warner deal and expects to make even more through the union of Discovery\u2019s reality television programming and WarnerMedia\u2019s CNN, HBO and Warner Bros. Studios.\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">In the deal with Discovery, AT&T shareholders will get stock in the new company.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Based on Discovery\u2019s stock price on <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 14,</span> the day before the transaction was disclosed, those shares would be <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">worth $59 billion</span></span>.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">AT&T will <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">get $43 billion</span> in cash, securities and WarnerMedia\u2019s agreement to <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">retain $1.5 billion</span> of its debt.\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">The telecom giant already has booked an <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">additional $5 billion</span> by selling off WarnerMedia assets, including its stake in the streaming service Hulu, plus billions in cash it\u2019s received from the business <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2018.</span>\n</span>\u201cWe\u2019re comfortably above <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $100 billion</span> total value we paid when we bought Time Warner,\u201d said Fletcher Cook, AT&T\u2019s vice president for corporate communications.\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Yet Discovery\u2019s stock has sagged <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">roughly 12 percent</span> since the deal was announced \u2014 and the transaction is not scheduled to close until the middle of next year \u2014 calling into question whether AT&T\u2019s stake in the new Discovery is really <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">worth $59 billion</span></span>.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">AT&T\u2019s math also doesn\u2019t include the opportunity cost of <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">spending $100 billion</span> on TimeWarner rather than alternatives, such as building out the wireless network needed for an Internet-of-things future.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Limited by the debt it had taken on in the original Time Warner deal, AT&T this year was outspent by Verizon nearly 2-to-1 when the federal government auctioned off mid-band spectrum for 5G networks.</span> As rival Verizon <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">committed $53 billion</span>, AT&T could muster <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only $27 billion</span> for a contest that will be critical to its future.\n\u201cIf they didn\u2019t have DirecTV and WarnerMedia, they would have gone full throttle on C-band and spent closer <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $50 billion</span>. They were hamstrung,\u201d Arden said.\nFor AT&T, the about-face on WarnerMedia marks a significant strategic shift after decades of buying and selling other companies.\nThe corporate saga began <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1984,</span> when the original Bell system was split into the long distance provider AT&T and seven regional phone companies.\nMore than a decade later, after Congress passed landmark legislation designed to fuel competition among landline, wireless and media companies, AT&T began a series of acquisitions that slowly reassembled much of what had been broken up.\n<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2015,</span> it acquired DirecTV before announcing plans to snap up Time Warner the following year. That purchase was delayed when the Trump administration launched an unsuccessful legal challenge on antitrust grounds.\n\u201cAT&T has been an acquisition machine for decades. It\u2019s been instrumental to their growth,\u201d said Scott Cleland, president of Precursor, a research consultancy. \u201cEventually, that strategy ran out of gas.\u201d\nMany analysts say the company would have been better off never having gotten involved with Time Warner or DirecTV, the satellite operator it acquired <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015 for</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $67 billion</span>. The strategy of owning both media and telecommunications businesses under a single corporate roof, they say, was ill-conceived.\n\u201cAT&T is probably getting out of this, at best, break-even or slightly better than that,\u201d said David Barden, senior telecom analyst for Bank of America.\nAT&T\u2019s move comes just two weeks after Verizon unloaded its media assets, Yahoo and AOL, in <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $5 billion</span> sale to Apollo Global Management, a private equity firm. But Verizon\u2019s media mistake was far less expensive: It spent <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just $9 billion</span> to acquire the two fading Internet-era stars <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015 and</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2017,</span> at a fraction of what AT&T spent.\nAT&T belatedly recognized that making a global success of HBO Max against fierce competition from Netflix and Disney Plus would have required daunting investments. Facing a choice between doubling down and getting out, the company blinked.\n\u201cThey decided their core competency was connectivity not content,\u201d said Barden, who thinks management made the right call.\nAs investors mulled the outlook for AT&T and the new Discovery-WarnerMedia combination, it was clear that AT&T has been forced to abandon its ambitious plans and retreat to its roots as a communications company.\nYet AT&T may finally have stumbled onto a promising strategy, as the Discovery deal addresses some of its acknowledged weaknesses. <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Executives plan to devote all of <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $43 billion</span> raised by the WarnerMedia spinoff to shrinking the company\u2019s debt load, which has grown <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $169 billion</span>.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">That should accelerate ongoing debt reduction efforts by one year and free up the company to increase spending on its wireless network and to more than double <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 30 million</span> homes its fiber broadband connections, executives said.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">In the short run, AT&T stock may be depressed as dividend-seeking retail investors sell.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">But eventually, professional fund managers who in the past have been underwhelmed by the company\u2019s strategy and repelled by its high debt load will be attracted to the new plan, Barden said.\n</span>\u201cAT&T bit off more than they could chew,\u201d said Jeff Kagan, an industry consultant. \u201cBut it remains a powerful, strong company.\u201d", "displayed_text":

They were hamstrung,\u201d Arden said.\nFor AT&T, the about-face on WarnerMedia marks a significant strategic shift after decades of buying and selling other companies.\nThe corporate saga began <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1984,</span> when the original Bell system was split into the long distance provider AT&T and seven regional phone companies.\nMore than a decade later, after Congress passed landmark legislation designed to fuel competition among landline, wireless and media companies, AT&T began a series of acquisitions that slowly reassembled much of what had been broken up.\n<span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2015,</span> it acquired DirecTV before announcing plans to snap up Time Warner the following year. That purchase was delayed when the Trump administration launched an unsuccessful legal challenge on antitrust grounds.\n\u201cAT&T has been an acquisition machine for decades. It\u2019s been instrumental to their growth,\u201d said Scott Cleland, president of Precursor, a research consultancy. \u201cEventually, that strategy ran out of gas.\u201d\nMany analysts say the company would have been better off never having gotten involved with Time Warner or DirecTV, the satellite operator it acquired <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015 for</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $67 billion</span>. The strategy of owning both media and telecommunications businesses under a single corporate roof, they say, was ill-conceived.\n\u201cAT&T is probably getting out of this, at best, break-even or slightly better than that,\u201d said David Barden, senior telecom analyst for Bank of America.\nAT&T\u2019s move comes just two weeks after Verizon unloaded its media assets, Yahoo and AOL, in <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $5 billion</span> sale to Apollo Global Management, a private equity firm. But Verizon\u2019s media mistake was far less expensive: It spent <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just $9 billion</span> to acquire the two fading Internet-era stars <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2015 and</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2017,</span> at a fraction of what AT&T spent.\nAT&T belatedly recognized that making a global success of HBO Max against fierce competition from Netflix and Disney Plus would have required daunting investments. Facing a choice between doubling down and getting out, the company blinked.\n\u201cThey decided their core competency was connectivity not content,\u201d said Barden, who thinks management made the right call.\nAs investors mulled the outlook for AT&T and the new Discovery-WarnerMedia combination, it was clear that AT&T has been forced to abandon its ambitious plans and retreat to its roots as a communications company.\nYet AT&T may finally have stumbled onto a promising strategy, as the Discovery deal addresses some of its acknowledged weaknesses. <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Executives plan to devote all of <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $43 billion</span> raised by the WarnerMedia spinoff to shrinking the company\u2019s debt load, which has grown <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $169 billion</span>.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">That should accelerate ongoing debt reduction efforts by one year and free up the company to increase spending on its wireless network and to more than double <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 30 million</span> homes its fiber broadband connections, executives said.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">In the short run, AT&T stock may be depressed as dividend-seeking retail investors sell.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">But eventually, professional fund managers who in the past have been underwhelmed by the company\u2019s strategy and repelled by its high debt load will be attracted to the new plan, Barden said.\n</span>\u201cAT&T bit off more than they could chew,\u201d said Jeff Kagan, an industry consultant. \u201cBut it remains a powerful, strong company.\u201d"}, "70781": {"id": "70781", "text": "<h3>Global Competition to Cut Corporate Taxes Heats Up</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Both Theresa May and Donald Trump are backing tax cuts to keep companies at home and attracting new ones\n\nUpdated Nov.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 21,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016 6</span>:57 pm ET\n\nAn international race to lower corporate taxes is back in the global spotlight after Britain recommitted to slashing rates and as the election of Donald Trump puts U.S. corporate-tax overhauls on the front burner.\n\n</span>U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday officially endorsed a move by Britain\u2019s previous Conservative government to lower the main corporate rate there <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 17% by</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2020,</span> from today\u2019<span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 20%.</span> <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">President-elect Donald Trump promoted on the campaign trail <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 15% U</span>.S. headline corporate tax-rate\u2014down from the <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">current 35%.</span>\n\n</span>Mr. Trump\u2019s plan is far from a done deal. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">It faces domestic political hurdles and fiscal reality.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">And Mrs. May backed a tax cut already approved by Parliament but stopped short of endorsing her predecessor\u2019s further recommendation\u2014made after the Brexit vote\u2014to go down <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 15%.</span>\n\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Still, the rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic represent the latest volleys in a long tradition of trying to use national corporate-tax codes to spur investment at home or lure foreign firms.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The new attention being paid to corporate tax in both places follows close on the heels of recent moves in Japan, Canada, Italy and France to attract investment with lower rates of their own.\n\n</span>For Britain, the Brexit decision has made the pressure to keep the welcome mat out especially intense.

Penney Co. and Sears Holdings Corp. racing to close stores, America's weakest malls are being pushed to the brink.\n\nNearly half of <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1,050 indoor</span> and open air malls in the U.S. have both of those struggling chains as anchor tenants, according to real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Of those malls, nearly a quarter are struggling with sales <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below $300 per</span> square foot and vacancy rates <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">above 20%,</span> meaning they will have a hard time finding new tenants if old ones leave.\n\n</span>For an already-weakened mall industry, the negative turn for two once-reliable anchors is promising more stress at a time when the Internet is steadily stealing traffic. And the pressure is only growing. Sears Chief Executive Eddie Lampert this week said he plans to close more stores to help return the company to profitability.\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Vacancy rates rose and sales plunged at the Gallery at Military Circle, <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 5 miles</span> from downtown Norfolk, Va., after the Sears store closed its doors two years ago.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Eventually the mall's owner missed multiple payments on its debt.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Remaining retail tenants worry about what will happen when the Penney store closes this month, darkening another corner of the 44-year-old property.\n\n</span>Bruce Van, who manages Gent's, a locally owned boutique specializing in men's suits and fedoras and Sunday church clothes, said foot traffic fell by more than half after the Sears closed.\n\n\"When J.C. Penney goes out in May, it's going to be bad,\" said Mr. Van, who is also pastor at Rivers of Life Fellowship in Hampton, Va.\n\nThe first U.S. indoor mall opened in Edina, Minn., <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1956,</span> and construction peaked in the 1980s. Only six new malls have been built <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2010,</span> according to CoStar Group, a provider of commercial real-estate information. Meanwhile, the number of \"dead malls,\" those with vacancy rates <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 40%,</span> has nearly tripled <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2006 to</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 74 properties</span>.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The fate of the mall business matters, because even as the industry struggles, it remains an important source of economic activity.\n\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Sales per square foot at the nation's malls grew <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 2.6% last</span> year\u2014their slowest pace <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2009,</span> according to International Council of Shopping Centers.</span> Vacancy rates are stubbornly high, at an average of more <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 8% at</span> regional malls, not far off <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2011 peak</span> in <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 9.4%,</span> according to data company Reis Inc.\n\n\"Just because people are making fewer trips to the mall doesn't mean they're spending less,\" said Jesse Tron, a spokesman for the ICSC. Mr. Tron said that malls are trying to reinvent themselves by adding entertainment like indoor golf courses and higher-end restaurants, as well as services such as same-day delivery.\n\nStill, it is tough to reverse such high vacancy rates when large anchor-tenant retailers like Sears and Penney are closing stores and others like Macy's Inc. are opening fewer locations.\n\nPenney, which racked <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up $2.4 billion</span> in losses over the past two years, plans to <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">close 33 of</span> its stores, most of them in malls. Sears, with losses <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $2.3 billion</span> over the same period, has <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">closed 116 of</span> its full-line Sears stores <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2010.</span> Penney and Sears declined to comment.\n\nTo be sure, the exit of a troubled retailer can create an opportunity for stronger malls to find healthier tenants. But it is a different situation for struggling malls. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">And the potential damage from losing an anchor tenant is especially high in malls that have both Penney and Sears as tenants, said Gary Balter, a retail analyst with Credit Suisse.</span> \"If one of them goes, it almost forces the other one out, because the mall just won't get enough traffic,\" Mr. Balter said.\n\nThe exit of an anchor can cause other stores to leave or renegotiate their leases, contributing to a spiral of declining traffic and investment.\n\nAt the Gallery at Military Circle, the cavernous,<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 128,000</span>-square-foot space once occupied by Sears remains empty. \"For Lease\" posters dot the windows of other darkened storefronts.\n\nThe mall's situation is already tenuous. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">In November, and again in February and April, Thor Equities LLC, its owner, missed payments on <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $53 million</span> securitized loan, and Thor is in talks to restructure the debt, according to Trepp LLC, a company that collects data on real-estate debt.\n\n</span>The Gallery is hanging on to its other anchors\u2014Macy's at the north end and an 18-screen Cinemark Holdings Inc. movie theater on the south. A Macy's spokesman said the retailer has no plans to leave.

Penney Co. and Sears Holdings Corp. racing to close stores, America's weakest malls are being pushed to the brink.\n\nNearly half of <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 1,050 indoor</span> and open air malls in the U.S. have both of those struggling chains as anchor tenants, according to real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Of those malls, nearly a quarter are struggling with sales <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below $300 per</span> square foot and vacancy rates <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">above 20%,</span> meaning they will have a hard time finding new tenants if old ones leave.\n\n</span>For an already-weakened mall industry, the negative turn for two once-reliable anchors is promising more stress at a time when the Internet is steadily stealing traffic. And the pressure is only growing. Sears Chief Executive Eddie Lampert this week said he plans to close more stores to help return the company to profitability.\n\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Vacancy rates rose and sales plunged at the Gallery at Military Circle, <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 5 miles</span> from downtown Norfolk, Va., after the Sears store closed its doors two years ago.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Eventually the mall's owner missed multiple payments on its debt.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Remaining retail tenants worry about what will happen when the Penney store closes this month, darkening another corner of the 44-year-old property.\n\n</span>Bruce Van, who manages Gent's, a locally owned boutique specializing in men's suits and fedoras and Sunday church clothes, said foot traffic fell by more than half after the Sears closed.\n\n\"When J.C. Penney goes out in May, it's going to be bad,\" said Mr. Van, who is also pastor at Rivers of Life Fellowship in Hampton, Va.\n\nThe first U.S. indoor mall opened in Edina, Minn., <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1956,</span> and construction peaked in the 1980s. Only six new malls have been built <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2010,</span> according to CoStar Group, a provider of commercial real-estate information. Meanwhile, the number of \"dead malls,\" those with vacancy rates <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 40%,</span> has nearly tripled <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2006 to</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 74 properties</span>.\n\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The fate of the mall business matters, because even as the industry struggles, it remains an important source of economic activity.\n\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Sales per square foot at the nation's malls grew <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 2.6% last</span> year\u2014their slowest pace <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2009,</span> according to International Council of Shopping Centers.</span> Vacancy rates are stubbornly high, at an average of more <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 8% at</span> regional malls, not far off <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2011 peak</span> in <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 9.4%,</span> according to data company Reis Inc.\n\n\"Just because people are making fewer trips to the mall doesn't mean they're spending less,\" said Jesse Tron, a spokesman for the ICSC. Mr. Tron said that malls are trying to reinvent themselves by adding entertainment like indoor golf courses and higher-end restaurants, as well as services such as same-day delivery.\n\nStill, it is tough to reverse such high vacancy rates when large anchor-tenant retailers like Sears and Penney are closing stores and others like Macy's Inc. are opening fewer locations.\n\nPenney, which racked <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up $2.4 billion</span> in losses over the past two years, plans to <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">close 33 of</span> its stores, most of them in malls. Sears, with losses <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $2.3 billion</span> over the same period, has <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">closed 116 of</span> its full-line Sears stores <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2010.</span> Penney and Sears declined to comment.\n\nTo be sure, the exit of a troubled retailer can create an opportunity for stronger malls to find healthier tenants. But it is a different situation for struggling malls. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">And the potential damage from losing an anchor tenant is especially high in malls that have both Penney and Sears as tenants, said Gary Balter, a retail analyst with Credit Suisse.</span> \"If one of them goes, it almost forces the other one out, because the mall just won't get enough traffic,\" Mr. Balter said.\n\nThe exit of an anchor can cause other stores to leave or renegotiate their leases, contributing to a spiral of declining traffic and investment.\n\nAt the Gallery at Military Circle, the cavernous,<span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 128,000</span>-square-foot space once occupied by Sears remains empty. \"For Lease\" posters dot the windows of other darkened storefronts.\n\nThe mall's situation is already tenuous. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">In November, and again in February and April, Thor Equities LLC, its owner, missed payments on <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $53 million</span> securitized loan, and Thor is in talks to restructure the debt, according to Trepp LLC, a company that collects data on real-estate debt.\n\n</span>The Gallery is hanging on to its other anchors\u2014Macy's at the north end and an 18-screen Cinemark Holdings Inc. movie theater on the south.

control</h3>Mitch McConnell was just finishing up his first term as the junior senator from Kentucky when a mass shooting rocked his hometown of Louisville.\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">On Sept.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 14,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1989,</span> a disgruntled employee entered the Standard Gravure printing plant in downtown Louisville and, armed with an AK-47 and other guns, killed eight and <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">wounded 12 others</span> before taking his own life \u2014 in what remains the deadliest mass shooting in the state\u2019s history.\n\n</span>At the time, mass shootings had not yet become the staple of American life that they are now, and McConnell said he was \u201cdeeply disturbed,\u201d declaring, \u201cWe must take action to stop such vicious crimes.\u201d\n\nBut he also added: \u201cWe need to be careful about legislating in the middle of a crisis.\u201d And in the days and weeks after, he did not join others in calling for a ban on assault weapons like the AK-47 used by the shooter.\n\nThe Standard Gravure massacre provided an early glimpse of how McConnell \u2014 now the Republican Senate minority leader \u2014 would handle mass shootings and their aftermath over the next three decades, consistently working to delay, obstruct or prevent most major gun-control legislation from passing Congress.\n\nMcConnell would go on to follow a similar playbook time and time again during his seven terms in Congress, offering vague promises of action, often without any specifics, only to be followed by no action or incremental measures that avoided new gun regulations. As a Republican leader, he also helped dissuade his conference \u2014 as after <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2012 mass</span> shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. \u2014 from supporting gun legislation and, as majority leader, refused to bring up significant gun-control measures for a vote.\n\nNow, the latest devastating and high-profile mass shootings \u2014 a massacre Tuesday at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Tex., that <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">left 19 students</span> and two teachers dead, <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 10 days</span> after a racist slaughter at Buffalo supermarket that <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">killed 10 </span>\u2014 have thrust Congress back into a fiery debate over what, if anything, lawmakers can do to curb gun violence.\n\nOn Thursday, McConnell told CNN that he had encouraged Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) to reach out to Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) \u2014 who made gun control a personal project after Sandy Hook \u2014 to begin discussing what bipartisan measures might be possible.\n\nBut many Democrats and anti-gun advocates remain skeptical, predicting that McConnell and his fellow Republicans are poised to obstruct any consequential gun-violence-prevention bills yet again.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s any one individual in the United States to blame for our inability to put things in place to prevent gun violence, it\u2019s Mitch McConnell,\u201d said Peter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords, a group devoted to fighting gun violence. \u201cMcConnell understands he\u2019s hostage to that extreme base that just doesn\u2019t tolerate any departure from any of their views.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans say that McConnell is less a singular obstacle than a savvy leader who is able to his read his conference and make decisions that help his senators and protect them politically. \u201cMcConnell knows where his members stand and makes the tough calls to protect their interests,\u201d a senior Republican aide said, explaining McConnell\u2019s overall motivations in addressing gun violence and gun legislation.\n\nMcConnell declined to comment.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1990,</span> the year after the Standard Gravure shooting, McConnell was up for reelection and found himself in a close race with Democrat Harvey Sloane, then the Jefferson County judge executive and a former Louisville mayor, who had called for banning assault weapons.\n\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2013,</span> following Sandy Hook, Sloane recounted in Louisville\u2019s Courier-Journal newspaper that as his race with McConnell tightened in the final stretch, McConnell and the National Rifle Association \u201cblistered the state falsely as to how this ban would eventually take away \u2018your hunting gun and the hand pistol you need for personal protection.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMcConnell defeated Sloane by five percentage points and, in his second term in the Senate, went on to vote against both the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1993 and</span> the Federal Assault Weapons Ban <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1994.</span>\n\n\u201cMitch is really Machiavellian,\u201d Sloane said in an interview with The Washington Post last week. \u201cHe\u2019s single-handedly held up any kind of gun legislation that\u2019s meaningful.\u201d\n\n\u2018It didn\u2019t change a thing\u2019\n\nIn <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">September 2019,</span> a group of gun-control advocates \u2014 including Kris Brown, the president of Brady, a gun violence prevention organization; Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights icon; and Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.), who lost her 17-year-old son in <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2012 shooting</span> \u2014 gathered on the West Lawn of the Capitol for a rally in favor of tougher background checks.\n\nAfter the rally, some in the group \u2014 which also included some McConnell constituents \u2014 decided to make their way to the then-majority leader\u2019s office for what Lewis might have called \u201cgood trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we walked over, John Lewis kind of leading us, talking about the importance of peaceful resistance,\u201d Brown recalled, adding that Lewis asked if someone should get Depends \u2014 a brand of adult diapers \u2014 because the group might be there for a while.\n\n\u201cHis staffers had no idea what to do with us,\u201d Brown said. \u201cMcConnell didn\u2019t have the human decency to sit down with John Lewis.\u201d\n\nInstead, a McConnell staffer ushered the group into a conference room and met with them for over an hour. Brown said that the staffer clearly seemed moved by Lewis, telling him that she held him in high esteem, and by the victims of gun violence, who recounted their stories one after another.\n\n\u201cShe was moved to tears, but it didn\u2019t change a thing,\u201d Brown said, saying the staffer essentially told the group \u201cthat it was just the wrong time to bring this bill forward.\u201d\n\nDoug Andres, a McConnell spokesman, said McConnell had been unable to meet with the group at the time because it was a surprise visit and he already had constituent meetings planned. He said the staffer simply explained to the group that then-President Donald Trump was unlikely to sign the bill they were pitching, and McConnell was not going to advocate for legislation he knew would fail.\n\nFor McConnell, however, the time has rarely seemed right.\n\nAlmost immediately after Sandy Hook, then-President Barack Obama tasked then-Vice President Joe Biden with putting together a robust policy response. McConnell \u2014 then the Senate minority leader \u2014 downplayed the effort.\n\nAsked about gun-control issues on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d in <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">January 2013 </span>\u2014 less than month after Sandy Hook \u2014 <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">McConnell said he was waiting to see Biden\u2019s proposal but did not plan to prioritize it over other issues like \u201cspending and debt\u201d in the coming months.\n\n</span>Then, later that month \u2014 after Obama <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">signed 23 executive</span> orders on guns in response to the tragedy that <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">left 20 kindergartners</span> dead \u2014 McConnell recorded a robocall and sent it out to gun owners in his state.\n\nThe Senate Republican leader has spent his career working to delay, obstruct or prevent most major firearms restrictions from being approved by Congress. (Video: Joy Yi/The Washington Post, Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/AP/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cPresident Obama and his team are doing everything in their power to restrict your constitutional right to keep and bear arms,\u201d McConnell said in the recording. \u201cTheir efforts to restrict your rights, invading your personal privacy and overstepping their bounds with executive orders, is just plain wrong.\u201d\n\nMcConnell also refused a meeting with the Sandy Hook families, according to someone familiar with the request, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal details. But eventually, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W. Va.) and Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) negotiated a modest bipartisan background checks bill, known as Manchin-Toomey.\n\nAt the time, McConnell was still adjusting to the rise of the hard-right tea party movement in the Republican base; in <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2010 Republican</span> Senate primary in Kentucky, Rand Paul vanquished Trey Grayson, McConnell\u2019s handpicked candidate, by riding the tea party wave in what some also viewed as a stinging rebuke of McConnell. And <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2013,</span> McConnell was already preparing for <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 2014 reelection</span> bid.\n\nWhen Manchin-Toomey finally came to the Senate floor for a vote in <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 2013,</span> McConnell pushed his conference to oppose the bill, which ultimately <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">failed 54 to</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 46,</span> falling short of <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 60 votes</span> needed for passage.\n\n\u201cMcConnell whipped hard against it. McConnell is obsessed with protecting his right flank,\u201d said Adam Jentleson, who at the time worked for then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), explaining why McConnell helped tank the background check bill. \u201cIt\u2019s why he\u2019s been able to survive as leader for so long.\u201d\n\nJesse Benton \u2014 a conservative activist who managed Paul\u2019<span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2010 Senate</span> campaign and who McConnell enlisted to manage <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 2014 one</span> \u2014 said that McConnell at the time \u201csaid something to me like, \u2018I hope you know I\u2019m not planning on supporting any of this crap.' \u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a firebrand like some of the [pro-gun] activists want, but he makes it clear to his team that he is a Second Amendment believer,\u201d Benton said. \u201cHe respects the legislative process and the fact that there are differing opinions in his own caucus, but he works it in his own way, as only he can.\u201d\n\nMcConnell was, at other times, willing to entertain the idea of some legislation on guns, partly as a way of releasing pressure from members of his caucus who wanted to show some legislative action after mass shootings.\n\nBut that approach has also earned him the ire of some Second Amendment advocates, some of whom ran ads against him during <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 2014 primary</span>.\n\n\u201cWhen the going gets tough, Mitch McConnell has always been absent from the fight,\u201d said Dudley Brown, the president of the National Association for Gun Rights, a hard-line alternative to the NRA. \u201cHe has never stood up when it was really tough.\u201d\n\n\u2018An obstacle to taking any action\u2019\n\nFor McConnell,<span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2018 opened</span> with a mass shooting at Marshall County High School near Benton, Ky., where a 15-year-old student killed two and injured more than a dozen others that January. The following month, another school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">left 17 dead</span> and drew yet another national outcry for stronger gun measures.\n\nAt the time, Trump offered messaging whiplash. In a meeting with Democratic and Republican lawmakers two weeks after Parkland, he called for \u201ccomprehensive\u201d gun legislation and chided Republicans for being \u201cpetrified\u201d of the NRA. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">But the next day, he hosted an NRA lobbyist in the Oval Office, declared the meeting \u201cgreat\u201d on Twitter and seemed to lose interest in working on gun legislation.\n\n</span>Still, a McConnell aide said, the combination of the Florida and Kentucky school shootings prompted McConnell, by then the Senate majority leader, to help pass two modest bills on background checks (the Fix NICS Act) and school safety (the Stop School Violence Act).\n\nThe Fix NICS Act helped improve the criminal background checks system to make background checks more thorough and accurate, and the stopping school violence measure authorized additional funding for improving school security and early intervention and school violence prevention programs.\n\nAnother big push for gun legislation came in the summer <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2019,</span> following back-to-back shootings on Aug.<span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3 and</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4 at</span> a Walmart Supercenter in majority-Hispanic El Paso and in a nightlife corridor in Dayton, Ohio, which left a <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">combined 23 people</span> dead and dozens more injured.\n\nThe Democratic blowback was fierce and directed squarely at McConnell \u2014 who was again campaigning for reelection \u2014 since the House had already passed a background check bill.\n\n\u201cI hope that Sen. McConnell would bring the Senate back tomorrow and pass the background check bill and send it to the president,\u201d Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown said after the shootings.\n\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The same day, Shannon Watts of Moms Demand Action, a gun violence prevention group, declared, \u201cWe need Mitch McConnell to allow a vote.\u201d\n\n</span>The Twitter account of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) retweeted both statements, and several days later, Pelosi wrote a public letter to Trump asking him to call on McConnell \u2014 whom she described as \u201can obstacle to taking any action\u201d \u2014 to call the Senate back into session.\n\nBy the night of Aug.<span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4,</span> protesters had gathered outside McConnell\u2019s Kentucky home with profane chants. Days later, dozens gathered outside his Louisville office.\n\nThat Thursday, Aug.<span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8,</span> McConnell went on Louisville\u2019s WHAS-AM radio to say he had spoken with Trump and was ready to take action. The president, he said, was \u201canxious to get an outcome, and so am I.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is fail to pass something,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cWhat I want to see here is an outcome.\u201d\n\nHe added that background checks \u2014 which he said had \u201ca lot of support\u201d publicly \u2014 and red flag measures would probably lead the discussion.\n\nBut a special session was never called.\n\nThe week before returning to Washington, McConnell did an interview with Hugh Hewitt on Sept.<span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3 that</span> laid out a different benchmark, deferring to Trump: \u201cI said several weeks ago that if the president took a position on a bill so that we knew we would actually be making a law and not just having serial votes, I\u2019d be happy to put it on the floor.\u201d\n\nBy the time McConnell brought the Senate back in session, his focus had shifted. In his first remarks on the Senate floor, McConnell made no mention of the gun issue. Just over a week later, The Post reported on a whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s communications with a foreign leader, eventually leading to Trump\u2019s first impeachment for his efforts to withhold military aid to Ukraine \u2014 drawing Trump\u2019s attention away from guns.\n\nThis past Wednesday, the day after the devastating Uvalde elementary school shooting, McConnell \u2014 now the Senate minority leader again \u2014 took to the Senate floor to declare himself and the nation \u201csickened and outraged by the senseless evil\u201d that left at <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 19 students</span> and two teachers \u201cmurdered for no apparent reason at all.\u201d\n\nHe did not mention guns or any possible legislation, instead focusing on the \u201cinnocent young lives\u201d that were prematurely extinguished.\n\n\u201cWords simply fail,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nOn Thursday, however, McConnell tasked Cornyn with negotiating with Democrats.\n\n\u201cMaybe this will provide some impetus\u201d for compromise, Cornyn told reporters at the Capitol on Thursday. \u201cThis is horrible. Hard to imagine anything that could be worse than parents worrying about the safety of their kids going to school.\u201d\n\nBut most Republicans signaled in recent days that major legislation remains unlikely.\n\n\u201cThere are no right words to describe the heartbreaking and horrific tragedy that happened at Robb Elementary School,\u201d said Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), before adding later: \u201cWe must be thoughtful about how we discuss and handle school safety and mental health issues. Federal changes should not be made in haste, and there\u2019s still many details we do not know as the investigation continues.\u201d\n\nAfter a vigil for the Uvalde victims, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) stormed away from an interview when a British reporter asked him why mass shootings happen \u201conly in America.\u201d Cruz accused the reporter of having a \u201cpolitical agenda.\u201d\n\nCruz also dismissed Democratic gun violence prevention proposals, saying that none of them would have stopped the Uvalde shooting, and later suggested legislation to \u201charden schools\u201d \u2014 such as having only one usable door.\n\nOn Friday, Trump \u2014 still the de facto leader of the Republican Party \u2014 joined other Republican officials in delivering a defiant response to the Uvalde massacre at an NRA annual meeting in Houston, arguing that new gun restrictions were pointless.\n\nSupport for stricter gun laws has increased after mass shootings at schools. In <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2018,</span> shortly after the Parkland shooting,<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 67 percent</span> said in a Gallup Poll that laws should be more strict \u2014 an increase <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 60 percent</span> who said the same in <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2017.</span> Similarly, support for stricter laws jumped <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 43 percent</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 58 percent</span> after the Sandy Hook shooting.\n\nIn contrast to support for gun restrictions in general, support for expanding background checks has stayed very high over time. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">A Pew Research Center poll last year <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">found 81 percent</span> of Americans supported making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks, <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">including 70 percent</span> of Republicans <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 92 percent</span> of Democrats.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">A 63 percent</span> majority supported a ban on assault-style weapons, <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">including 83 percent</span> of Democrats and less than half as many Republicans (37 percent).\n\nBut many gun-control advocates and Democrats remain skeptical that Republicans are prepared to change their approach. Matt Bennett \u2014 a co-founder of Third Way, a Democratic think tank \u2014 said polarized politics prevents the handful of Republicans who may privately support some gun safety laws to do so publicly.\n\n\u201cThe ones who believe in their hearts that they should do something \u2014 and who knows how many there truly are \u2014 don\u2019t want to do it, because they don\u2019t want to get crosswise with the base,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nJohn Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, latched onto McConnell\u2019s declaration on the Senate floor that \u201cwords simply fail.\u201d\n\nHe said he agrees completely.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to mince words. The Republican senators are what is costing American lives. And McConnell is the head of the Republican Senate,\u201d Feinblatt said. \u201cI am encouraged that McConnell gave the green light to Cornyn. That is what I would call step one.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cThere is no question about it: Inaction is not an option.\u201d\n\nEmily Guskin, Colby Itkowitz, Alice Crites and Laura Meckler contributed to this report.", "displayed_text": "<h3>Inside Mitch McConnell\u2019s decades-long effort to block gun control</h3>Mitch McConnell was just finishing up his first term as the junior senator from Kentucky when a mass shooting rocked his hometown of Louisville.\n\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">On Sept.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 14,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1989,</span> a disgruntled employee entered the Standard Gravure printing plant in downtown Louisville and, armed with an AK-47 and other guns, killed eight and <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">wounded 12 others</span> before taking his own life \u2014 in what remains the deadliest mass shooting in the state\u2019s history.\n\n</span>At the time, mass shootings had not yet become the staple of American life that they are now, and McConnell said he was \u201cdeeply disturbed,\u201d declaring, \u201cWe must take action to stop such vicious crimes.\u201d\n\nBut he also added: \u201cWe need to be careful about legislating in the middle of a crisis.\u201d And in the days and weeks after, he did not join others in calling for a ban on assault weapons like the AK-47 used by the shooter.\n\nThe Standard Gravure massacre provided an early glimpse of how McConnell \u2014 now the Republican Senate minority leader \u2014 would handle mass shootings and their aftermath over the next three decades, consistently working to delay, obstruct or prevent most major gun-control legislation from passing Congress.\n\nMcConnell would go on to follow a similar playbook time and time again during his seven terms in Congress, offering vague promises of action, often without any specifics, only to be followed by no action or incremental measures that avoided new gun regulations. As a Republican leader, he also helped dissuade his conference \u2014 as after <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2012 mass</span> shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. \u2014 from supporting gun legislation and, as majority leader, refused to bring up significant gun-control measures for a vote.\n\nNow, the latest devastating and high-profile mass shootings \u2014 a massacre Tuesday at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Tex., that <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">left 19 students</span> and two teachers dead, <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 10 days</span> after a racist slaughter at Buffalo supermarket that <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">killed 10 </span>\u2014 have thrust Congress back into a fiery debate over what, if anything, lawmakers can do to curb gun violence.\n\nOn Thursday, McConnell told CNN that he had encouraged Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) to reach out to Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) \u2014 who made gun control a personal project after Sandy Hook \u2014 to begin discussing what bipartisan measures might be possible.\n\nBut many Democrats and anti-gun advocates remain skeptical, predicting that McConnell and his fellow Republicans are poised to obstruct any consequential gun-violence-prevention bills yet again.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s any one individual in the United States to blame for our inability to put things in place to prevent gun violence, it\u2019s Mitch McConnell,\u201d said Peter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords, a group devoted to fighting gun violence. \u201cMcConnell understands he\u2019s hostage to that extreme base that just doesn\u2019t tolerate any departure from any of their views.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans say that McConnell is less a singular obstacle than a savvy leader who is able to his read his conference and make decisions that help his senators and protect them politically. \u201cMcConnell knows where his members stand and makes the tough calls to protect their interests,\u201d a senior Republican aide said, explaining McConnell\u2019s overall motivations in addressing gun violence and gun legislation.\n\nMcConnell declined to comment.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1990,</span> the year after the Standard Gravure shooting, McConnell was up for reelection and found himself in a close race with Democrat Harvey Sloane, then the Jefferson County judge executive and a former Louisville mayor, who had called for banning assault weapons.\n\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2013,</span> following Sandy Hook, Sloane recounted in Louisville\u2019s Courier-Journal newspaper that as his race with McConnell tightened in the final stretch, McConnell and the National Rifle Association \u201cblistered the state falsely as to how this ban would eventually take away \u2018your hunting gun and the hand pistol you need for personal protection.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMcConnell defeated Sloane by five percentage points and, in his second term in the Senate, went on to vote against both the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1993 and</span> the Federal Assault Weapons Ban <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1994.</span>\n\n\u201cMitch is really Machiavellian,\u201d Sloane said in an interview with The Washington Post last week. \u201cHe\u2019s single-handedly held up any kind of gun legislation that\u2019s meaningful.\u201d\n\n\u2018It didn\u2019t change a thing\u2019\n\nIn <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">September 2019,</span> a group of gun-control advocates \u2014 including Kris Brown, the president of Brady, a gun violence prevention organization; Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights icon; and Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.), who lost her 17-year-old son in <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 2012 shooting</span> \u2014 gathered on the West Lawn of the Capitol for a rally in favor of tougher background checks.\n\nAfter the rally, some in the group \u2014 which also included some McConnell constituents \u2014 decided to make their way to the then-majority leader\u2019s office for what Lewis might have called \u201cgood trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we walked over, John Lewis kind of leading us, talking about the importance of peaceful resistance,\u201d Brown recalled, adding that Lewis asked if someone should get Depends \u2014 a brand of adult diapers \u2014 because the group might be there for a while.\n\n\u201cHis staffers had no idea what to do with us,\u201d Brown said. \u201cMcConnell didn\u2019t have the human decency to sit down with John Lewis.\u201d\n\nInstead, a McConnell staffer ushered the group into a conference room and met with them for over an hour. Brown said that the staffer clearly seemed moved by Lewis, telling him that she held him in high esteem, and by the victims of gun violence, who recounted their stories one after another.\n\n\u201cShe was moved to tears, but it didn\u2019t change a thing,\u201d Brown said, saying the staffer essentially told the group \u201cthat it was just the wrong time to bring this bill forward.\u201d\n\nDoug Andres, a McConnell spokesman, said McConnell had been unable to meet with the group at the time because it was a surprise visit and he already had constituent meetings planned. He said the staffer simply explained to the group that then-President Donald Trump was unlikely to sign the bill they were pitching, and McConnell was not going to advocate for legislation he knew would fail.\n\nFor McConnell, however, the time has rarely seemed right.\n\nAlmost immediately after Sandy Hook, then-President Barack Obama tasked then-Vice President Joe Biden with putting together a robust policy response. McConnell \u2014 then the Senate minority leader \u2014 downplayed the effort.\n\nAsked about gun-control issues on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d in <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">January 2013 </span>\u2014 less than month after Sandy Hook \u2014 <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">McConnell said he was waiting to see Biden\u2019s proposal but did not plan to prioritize it over other issues like \u201cspending and debt\u201d in the coming months.\n\n</span>Then, later that month \u2014 after Obama <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">signed 23 executive</span> orders on guns in response to the tragedy that <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">left 20 kindergartners</span> dead \u2014 McConnell recorded a robocall and sent it out to gun owners in his state.\n\nThe Senate Republican leader has spent his career working to delay, obstruct or prevent most major firearms restrictions from being approved by Congress. (Video: Joy Yi/The Washington Post, Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/AP/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cPresident Obama and his team are doing everything in their power to restrict your constitutional right to keep and bear arms,\u201d McConnell said in the recording. \u201cTheir efforts to restrict your rights, invading your personal privacy and overstepping their bounds with executive orders, is just plain wrong.\u201d\n\nMcConnell also refused a meeting with the Sandy Hook families, according to someone familiar with the request, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal details. But eventually, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W. Va.) and Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) negotiated a modest bipartisan background checks bill, known as Manchin-Toomey.\n\nAt the time, McConnell was still adjusting to the rise of the hard-right tea party movement in the Republican base; in <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2010 Republican</span> Senate primary in Kentucky, Rand Paul vanquished Trey Grayson, McConnell\u2019s handpicked candidate, by riding the tea party wave in what some also viewed as a stinging rebuke of McConnell. And <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 2013,</span> McConnell was already preparing for <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 2014 reelection</span> bid.\n\nWhen Manchin-Toomey finally came to the Senate floor for a vote in <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">April 2013,</span> McConnell pushed his conference to oppose the bill, which ultimately <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">failed 54 to</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 46,</span> falling short of <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 60 votes</span> needed for passage.\n\n\u201cMcConnell whipped hard against it. McConnell is obsessed with protecting his right flank,\u201d said Adam Jentleson, who at the time worked for then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), explaining why McConnell helped tank the background check bill. \u201cIt\u2019s why he\u2019s been able to survive as leader for so long.\u201d\n\nJesse Benton \u2014 a conservative activist who managed Paul\u2019<span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2010 Senate</span> campaign and who McConnell enlisted to manage <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 2014 one</span> \u2014 said that McConnell at the time \u201csaid something to me like, \u2018I hope you know I\u2019m not planning on supporting any of this crap.' \u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a firebrand like some of the [pro-gun] activists want, but he makes it clear to his team that he is a Second Amendment believer,\u201d Benton said. \u201cHe respects the legislative process and the fact that there are differing opinions in his own caucus, but he works it in his own way, as only he can.\u201d\n\nMcConnell was, at other times, willing to entertain the idea of some legislation on guns, partly as a way of releasing pressure from members of his caucus who wanted to show some legislative action after mass shootings.\n\nBut that approach has also earned him the ire of some Second Amendment advocates, some of whom ran ads against him during <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 2014 primary</span>.\n\n\u201cWhen the going gets tough, Mitch McConnell has always been absent from the fight,\u201d said Dudley Brown, the president of the National Association for Gun Rights, a hard-line alternative to the NRA. \u201cHe has never stood up when it was really tough.\u201d\n\n\u2018An obstacle to taking any action\u2019\n\nFor McConnell,<span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2018 opened</span> with a mass shooting at Marshall County High School near Benton, Ky., where a 15-year-old student killed two and injured more than a dozen others that January. The following month, another school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">left 17 dead</span> and drew yet another national outcry for stronger gun measures.\n\nAt the time, Trump offered messaging whiplash. In a meeting with Democratic and Republican lawmakers two weeks after Parkland, he called for \u201ccomprehensive\u201d gun legislation and chided Republicans for being \u201cpetrified\u201d of the NRA. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">But the next day, he hosted an NRA lobbyist in the Oval Office, declared the meeting \u201cgreat\u201d on Twitter and seemed to lose interest in working on gun legislation.\n\n</span>Still, a McConnell aide said, the combination of the Florida and Kentucky school shootings prompted McConnell, by then the Senate majority leader, to help pass two modest bills on background checks (the Fix NICS Act) and school safety (the Stop School Violence Act).\n\nThe Fix NICS Act helped improve the criminal background checks system to make background checks more thorough and accurate, and the stopping school violence measure authorized additional funding for improving school security and early intervention and school violence prevention programs.\n\nAnother big push for gun legislation came in the summer <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2019,</span> following back-to-back shootings on Aug.<span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3 and</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4 at</span> a Walmart Supercenter in majority-Hispanic El Paso and in a nightlife corridor in Dayton, Ohio, which left a <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">combined 23 people</span> dead and dozens more injured.\n\nThe Democratic blowback was fierce and directed squarely at McConnell \u2014 who was again campaigning for reelection \u2014 since the House had already passed a background check bill.\n\n\u201cI hope that Sen. McConnell would bring the Senate back tomorrow and pass the background check bill and send it to the president,\u201d Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown said after the shootings.\n\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The same day, Shannon Watts of Moms Demand Action, a gun violence prevention group, declared, \u201cWe need Mitch McConnell to allow a vote.\u201d\n\n</span>The Twitter account of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) retweeted both statements, and several days later, Pelosi wrote a public letter to Trump asking him to call on McConnell \u2014 whom she described as \u201can obstacle to taking any action\u201d \u2014 to call the Senate back into session.\n\nBy the night of Aug.<span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4,</span> protesters had gathered outside McConnell\u2019s Kentucky home with profane chants. Days later, dozens gathered outside his Louisville office.\n\nThat Thursday, Aug.<span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8,</span> McConnell went on Louisville\u2019s WHAS-AM radio to say he had spoken with Trump and was ready to take action. The president, he said, was \u201canxious to get an outcome, and so am I.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is fail to pass something,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cWhat I want to see here is an outcome.\u201d\n\nHe added that background checks \u2014 which he said had \u201ca lot of support\u201d publicly \u2014 and red flag measures would probably lead the discussion.\n\nBut a special session was never called.\n\nThe week before returning to Washington, McConnell did an interview with Hugh Hewitt on Sept.<span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3 that</span> laid out a different benchmark, deferring to Trump: \u201cI said several weeks ago that if the president took a position on a bill so that we knew we would actually be making a law and not just having serial votes, I\u2019d be happy to put it on the floor.\u201d\n\nBy the time McConnell brought the Senate back in session, his focus had shifted. In his first remarks on the Senate floor, McConnell made no mention of the gun issue. Just over a week later, The Post reported on a whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s communications with a foreign leader, eventually leading to Trump\u2019s first impeachment for his efforts to withhold military aid to Ukraine \u2014 drawing Trump\u2019s attention away from guns.\n\nThis past Wednesday, the day after the devastating Uvalde elementary school shooting, McConnell \u2014 now the Senate minority leader again \u2014 took to the Senate floor to declare himself and the nation \u201csickened and outraged by the senseless evil\u201d that left at <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 19 students</span> and two teachers \u201cmurdered for no apparent reason at all.\u201d\n\nHe did not mention guns or any possible legislation, instead focusing on the \u201cinnocent young lives\u201d that were prematurely extinguished.\n\n\u201cWords simply fail,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nOn Thursday, however, McConnell tasked Cornyn with negotiating with Democrats.\n\n\u201cMaybe this will provide some impetus\u201d for compromise, Cornyn told reporters at the Capitol on Thursday. \u201cThis is horrible. Hard to imagine anything that could be worse than parents worrying about the safety of their kids going to school.\u201d\n\nBut most Republicans signaled in recent days that major legislation remains unlikely.\n\n\u201cThere are no right words to describe the heartbreaking and horrific tragedy that happened at Robb Elementary School,\u201d said Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), before adding later: \u201cWe must be thoughtful about how we discuss and handle school safety and mental health issues. Federal changes should not be made in haste, and there\u2019s still many details we do not know as the investigation continues.\u201d\n\nAfter a vigil for the Uvalde victims, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) stormed away from an interview when a British reporter asked him why mass shootings happen \u201conly in America.\u201d Cruz accused the reporter of having a \u201cpolitical agenda.\u201d\n\nCruz also dismissed Democratic gun violence prevention proposals, saying that none of them would have stopped the Uvalde shooting, and later suggested legislation to \u201charden schools\u201d \u2014 such as having only one usable door.\n\nOn Friday, Trump \u2014 still the de facto leader of the Republican Party \u2014 joined other Republican officials in delivering a defiant response to the Uvalde massacre at an NRA annual meeting in Houston, arguing that new gun restrictions were pointless.\n\nSupport for stricter gun laws has increased after mass shootings at schools. In <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2018,</span> shortly after the Parkland shooting,<span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 67 percent</span> said in a Gallup Poll that laws should be more strict \u2014 an increase <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 60 percent</span> who said the same in <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 2017.</span> Similarly, support for stricter laws jumped <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 43 percent</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 58 percent</span> after the Sandy Hook shooting.\n\nIn contrast to support for gun restrictions in general, support for expanding background checks has stayed very high over time. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">A Pew Research Center poll last year <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">found 81 percent</span> of Americans supported making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks, <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">including 70 percent</span> of Republicans <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 92 percent</span> of Democrats.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">A 63 percent</span> majority supported a ban on assault-style weapons, <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">including 83 percent</span> of Democrats and less than half as many Republicans (37 percent).\n\nBut many gun-control advocates and Democrats remain skeptical that Republicans are prepared to change their approach. Matt Bennett \u2014 a co-founder of Third Way, a Democratic think tank \u2014 said polarized politics prevents the handful of Republicans who may privately support some gun safety laws to do so publicly.\n\n\u201cThe ones who believe in their hearts that they should do something \u2014 and who knows how many there truly are \u2014 don\u2019t want to do it, because they don\u2019t want to get crosswise with the base,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nJohn Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, latched onto McConnell\u2019s declaration on the Senate floor that \u201cwords simply fail.\u201d\n\nHe said he agrees completely.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to mince words. The Republican senators are what is costing American lives. And McConnell is the head of the Republican Senate,\u201d Feinblatt said. \u201cI am encouraged that McConnell gave the green light to Cornyn. That is what I would call step one.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cThere is no question about it: Inaction is not an option.\u201d\n\nEmily Guskin, Colby Itkowitz, Alice Crites and Laura Meckler contributed to this report."}, "73212": {"id": "73212", "text": "<h3>California, as Clinton Territory, Finds Itself a Political Outlier</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Expanded Supply of Commodities Has Moderated Prices Pushed Up by Chinese Demand\n\nDec.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2013 11</span>:00 pm ET\n\nNINGDE, China\u2014The price of nickel, a metal used to make stainless steel for everything from sauce pans to guitar strings, spiked <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">past $50,000 a</span> metric ton <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2007 from</span> less <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $10,000 just</span> a few years earlier.\n\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">With nickel largely controlled by Western companies, China's swelling economy was especially vulnerable\u2014until some of its steel producers figured out how to substitute a lower-grade \"nickel pig iron,\" unlocking a mother lode of cheap supply.\n\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">The innovation has sent nickel prices tumbling to less <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $14,000 a</span> metric ton, and turned China into a leading nickel producer.</span> <span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The country now turns out more <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 400,000 metric</span> tons of nickel pig iron a year, equal to a fifth of world-wide demand.\n\n</span><span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Economists for years warned that rising demand for natural resources by China and other emerging markets would outstrip supply, leaving the world short of everything from nickel to coal, copper and corn.\n\n</span>But a remarkable period of innovation and investment has produced a far different picture. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Expanded supply has helped moderate commodity prices over the past year after a decade of demand from China helped push many prices into the stratosphere.\n\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The International Monetary Fund's index of all commodity prices is down <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 12% from</span> recent peaks;

He says it was as if \u201ca whole new community had been built overnight.\u201d <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Now he\u2019s worried about the impact of the company\u2019s announcement Tuesday that it will move its corporate headquarters to New York and relocate most of <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">its 1,300 Maryland</span> jobs.\n</span>\u201cWe\u2019re still going to be open,\u201d Ayaba said, \u201cbut it\u2019s going to be slower than usual around here.\u201d\nPlenty of others share his concerns. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Discovery\u2019s exit will cost Montgomery County and Maryland tens of millions of dollars in lost payroll, tax receipts and vendor sales.</span> It will deprive Silver Spring of the high-profile anchor company \u2014 perhaps best-known for airing \u201cShark Week\u201d \u2014 that sparked the suburb\u2019s commercial revival beginning in the late 1990s. It will also force the county to find a new occupant for the landmark edifice close to the Silver Spring Metro station.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">In addition, for the greater Washington region, Discovery\u2019s decision stirred fresh anxiety about structural weaknesses in the area\u2019s economy that hamper its ability to compete for top-quality companies.</span> The headquarters move \u2014 largely to be closer to the entertainment industry mecca that is New York \u2014 cripples hopes that the Washington region can develop as a national hub for broadcast and digital entertainment media.\n[Discovery Communications is selling Md. headquarters and moving to New York.]\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Montgomery\u2019s failed effort to retain several hundred back-office jobs also highlighted the challenges posed by the area\u2019s high prices.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Discovery is moving those positions to Knoxville, Tenn., where it said the cost of living is <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 40 percent</span> lower.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate because this is exactly the type of company Washington is trying to attract: a business that isn\u2019t dependent on government spending and can help diversify the economy,\u201d said Stephen S. Fuller, a regional economist at George Mason University.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt does damage to our brand and the brand we would like to have, that the Washington area is a good place to do business,\u201d Fuller said.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Discovery executives and Maryland elected officials pushed back against the notion that the company\u2019s decision resulted from an unattractive business climate.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">They said the change was inevitable because of Discovery\u2019s acquisition, <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $14.6 billion</span> cash-and-stock deal that is still in progress, of Scripps Networks Interactive, owner of HGTV, Food Network and the Travel Channel.\n</span>The new company would have major offices in three locations \u2014 New York, Silver Spring and Knoxville \u2014 and it made sense to consolidate operations and reduce that number to two.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cOur decision has nothing to do with incentives or the business environment in Montgomery County,\u201d chief corporate operating officer David C. Leavy said.</span> \u201cWe\u2019ve had a wonderful run [here].\u201d\n[Turnabout as fair play? Md. Democrats roast Hogan over Discovery\u2019s move to New York.]\nGov. Larry Hogan (R) said top Discovery executives told him there was nothing the state could have done to prevent the loss.\n\u201cThey assured us it didn\u2019t have anything to do with Maryland,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThey\u2019re simply going through a merger, as most media outlets are.\u201d\n<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">But there was no disguising the sobering reality that the state lost out to New York for the high-end, creative jobs \u2014 some of which will also go to Los Angeles \u2014 and to Tennessee for the low-end positions.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Some technology jobs will also cross the river to Sterling, Va., while several hundred positions will remain in Maryland.\n</span>\u201cThis is a shot across the bow for this region,\u201d said Bob Buchanan, chairman of <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">the Montgomery County Economic Development Corp.</span> \u201cWe need to seriously address some of these challenges.\u201d\nDiscovery\u2019s departure is particularly bitter because it was a homegrown success story, a company founded in Landover <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1985 that</span> grew to be an international powerhouse. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Its exit follows an all-too-familiar pattern in which start-ups take root here, blossom and then are plucked away, often through takeovers, to go to more nurturing business ecosystems.\n</span>\u201cWe don\u2019t seem to be able to hold on to companies as they scale and become successful,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cBusinesses are realizing they get a bigger bang for their buck if they go elsewhere.\u201d\nFrom its origins as the Discovery Channel, dedicated to documentaries and nonfiction television programming, Discovery Communications added channels such as TLC, Animal Planet, the Science Channel and OWN (the Oprah Winfrey Network).\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Discovery was lured to downtown Silver Spring in the late 1990s, when Montgomery County offered an incentives package worth more <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than $10 million</span> in tax credits, grants and loans to set up shop there.\n</span>The company built <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $165 million</span>, 10-story tower. The move was the primary catalyst for the revival of Silver Spring, which enjoyed a surge of development including new restaurants, theaters and minority-owned small businesses.\nDiscovery\u2019s arrival \u201cput Silver Spring on the map and made it a center of documentary work around the world,\u201d said Doug Duncan, who was Montgomery county executive at the time.\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Since 2000,</span> the company has <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">received $12.3 million</span> in local and state tax incentives, grants and loans, according to Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks subsidies.\n</span>The company\u2019s departure is \u201cdevastating for Silver Spring,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cIt is going to be really hard to replace them.\u201d\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">That view was echoed by business owners near Discovery\u2019s headquarter.</span> Half a mile up Georgia Avenue at Crisfield Seafood, Bonnie Swanson was tending to the tail end of the lunch crowd at the restaurant her grandparents opened <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1945.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Swanson said the family business survived waves of economic instability in Silver Spring and <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2008 recession</span>.</span> But Discovery pulling out of Silver Spring was \u201cpetrifying.\u201d\nMoving forward, Swanson said, the county and state can\u2019t neglect Silver Spring in favor of other development plans, such as those in Bethesda, saying that Silver Spring had long been \u201cBethesda\u2019s redheaded stepsister.\u201d\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Facing the loss of lunchtime foot traffic and Discovery employees who host business dinners at Crisfield, Swanson said her restaurant would \u201cjust have to buckle our seat belts and hold on.</span> It\u2019s all we can do.\u201d\nA few blocks away, Juancarlo Parkhurst still had a few hours before his restaurant, Lina\u2019s Diner and Bar, opened for dinner. <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">He\u2019d heard rumors that Discovery might be pulling out of the area for more than a year, but on Tuesday, he was forced to deal with the prospect of losing much of his happy-hour crowd of Discovery employees.\n</span>Parkhurst said Discovery was \u201creally big in helping the renaissance of Silver Spring\u201d but also helped drive rent increases that were straining tenants.\n<span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">\u201cNow that there\u2019s no longer this anchor tenant and thousands of employees, it\u2019s very scary as a business operator,\u201d Parkhurst said.\n</span>Discovery\u2019s decision dealt a potentially fatal setback to ambitions in the Washington area to become a major player in the entertainment industry.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Economists said consolidation among media companies has already helped fuel an exodus in the sector.</span> BET Networks, the country\u2019s largest cable network for African American audiences, relocated its headquarters from Northeast Washington to New York last summer. Executives said the move was part of a years-long transition into the Manhattan offices of its parent company, Viacom, which bought BET <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $3 billion</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2000.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">The company had <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 40 full</span>-time employees <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">and 36 freelancers</span> in Washington.\n</span>Silver Spring is still home to Urban One, which <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">operates 55 radio</span> stations targeting African American listeners. But Discovery was the flagship company for this region\u2019s hopes to secure a permanent niche in the industry.\n\u201cWe have advocacy media and are the information center for political reasons, but not necessarily for documentaries or film entertainment,\u201d Buchanan said.\n<span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Business leaders said Discovery\u2019s decision highlighted the importance for the Washington region to promote economic sectors where the area already enjoys a competitive advantage and thus has good prospects to succeed.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Such sectors include cybersecurity, biotechnology, hospitality and financial services, industries with leading companies in the Washington area.</span> A Silver Spring pharmaceutical company, United Therapeutics, has been expanding.\n<span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">The Greater Washington Partnership, an alliance of chief executives of large employers, last month urged greater efforts in the area to train digital technology workers to aid all of those sectors.\n</span>\u201cRegions need to focus on their strengths,\u201d said Peter L. Scher, vice chairman of the partnership and chairman of the Mid-Atlantic region for JPMorgan Chase. \u201cWhat\u2019s important for the region is to keep its eye on the ball. What are the growth sectors, and how do we continue to nurture them?\u201d\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">The need to do more to promote growth separate from the federal government has become acute in recent years because of mandated government budget cuts in the process known as sequestration.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Economic growth has been weak <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2010,</span> compared with other big metro areas, as the region struggles to add new, well-paying jobs.</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">The jobs it has added \u2014 many of them in the service industry \u2014 are often low-paid positions with high turnover rates.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Among the country\u2019<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 15 largest</span> metropolitan areas, the Washington region ranks last in job creation and income growth, according to data from the Stephen S. Fuller Institute at GMU.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">As Discovery showed by shipping low-end jobs to Tennessee, the Washington region struggles to compete when business costs are a factor.\n</span>Montgomery and Maryland officials offered undisclosed incentives to Discovery to offset the lower costs in Knoxville, but the gap was too wide to bridge.\n<span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">\u201cThere\u2019s no question it\u2019s cheaper to do business in Knoxville,\u201d said Leavy, the Discovery executive.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">\u201cThey don\u2019t have a state income tax.</span> Property values are in <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 40 percent</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 50 percent</span> range,\u201d compared with those in Montgomery, he said.\n<span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Discovery also pointed to other cost advantages in Tennessee.</span> <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">According to <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2017 business</span> tax index, it said, Tennessee ranked 13th best while Maryland was 42nd.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Tennessee\u2019s corporate income tax rate <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 6.5 percent</span>, compared with Maryland\u2019<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 8.25 percent</span>.</span> <span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">According to the Council for Community and Economic Research, the cost of living in Knoxville <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 41 percent</span> below that of Silver Spring, Rockville and Frederick.\n</span>Discovery\u2019s move did not come as a surprise to close observers of the company. It has cut its workforce in Silver Spring by nearly half over the past decade. Chief executive David Zaslav, a native New Yorker who took over the company <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2007,</span> has been living in Manhattan in recent years even though the company\u2019s headquarters was in Maryland.\n\u201cWhen the new guy came in, there didn\u2019t seem to be any connection between him and the county, between him and Silver Spring,\u201d Duncan, the former county executive, said.\nThat was in contrast with Discovery\u2019s founder, John Hendricks, who had close relations with Duncan and other local officials. A West Virginia native, Hendricks was running a Maryland consulting firm before he launched Discovery <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1985 with</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $5 million</span> investment from Allen & Co., a boutique New York investment firm known for its media expertise. The timing was right. Cable pioneer John Malone was searching for content for his nascent cable system, and he invested in Discovery and agreed to carry the channel.

It will also force the county to find a new occupant for the landmark edifice close to the Silver Spring Metro station.\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">In addition, for the greater Washington region, Discovery\u2019s decision stirred fresh anxiety about structural weaknesses in the area\u2019s economy that hamper its ability to compete for top-quality companies.</span> The headquarters move \u2014 largely to be closer to the entertainment industry mecca that is New York \u2014 cripples hopes that the Washington region can develop as a national hub for broadcast and digital entertainment media.\n[Discovery Communications is selling Md. headquarters and moving to New York.]\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Montgomery\u2019s failed effort to retain several hundred back-office jobs also highlighted the challenges posed by the area\u2019s high prices.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Discovery is moving those positions to Knoxville, Tenn., where it said the cost of living is <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 40 percent</span> lower.\n</span><span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate because this is exactly the type of company Washington is trying to attract: a business that isn\u2019t dependent on government spending and can help diversify the economy,\u201d said Stephen S. Fuller, a regional economist at George Mason University.\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt does damage to our brand and the brand we would like to have, that the Washington area is a good place to do business,\u201d Fuller said.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Discovery executives and Maryland elected officials pushed back against the notion that the company\u2019s decision resulted from an unattractive business climate.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">They said the change was inevitable because of Discovery\u2019s acquisition, <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $14.6 billion</span> cash-and-stock deal that is still in progress, of Scripps Networks Interactive, owner of HGTV, Food Network and the Travel Channel.\n</span>The new company would have major offices in three locations \u2014 New York, Silver Spring and Knoxville \u2014 and it made sense to consolidate operations and reduce that number to two.\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">\u201cOur decision has nothing to do with incentives or the business environment in Montgomery County,\u201d chief corporate operating officer David C.

The move was the primary catalyst for the revival of Silver Spring, which enjoyed a surge of development including new restaurants, theaters and minority-owned small businesses.\nDiscovery\u2019s arrival \u201cput Silver Spring on the map and made it a center of documentary work around the world,\u201d said Doug Duncan, who was Montgomery county executive at the time.\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Since 2000,</span> the company has <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">received $12.3 million</span> in local and state tax incentives, grants and loans, according to Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks subsidies.\n</span>The company\u2019s departure is \u201cdevastating for Silver Spring,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cIt is going to be really hard to replace them.\u201d\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">That view was echoed by business owners near Discovery\u2019s headquarter.</span> Half a mile up Georgia Avenue at Crisfield Seafood, Bonnie Swanson was tending to the tail end of the lunch crowd at the restaurant her grandparents opened <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1945.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Swanson said the family business survived waves of economic instability in Silver Spring and <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2008 recession</span>.</span> But Discovery pulling out of Silver Spring was \u201cpetrifying.\u201d\nMoving forward, Swanson said, the county and state can\u2019t neglect Silver Spring in favor of other development plans, such as those in Bethesda, saying that Silver Spring had long been \u201cBethesda\u2019s redheaded stepsister.\u201d\n<span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Facing the loss of lunchtime foot traffic and Discovery employees who host business dinners at Crisfield, Swanson said her restaurant would \u201cjust have to buckle our seat belts and hold on.</span> It\u2019s all we can do.\u201d\nA few blocks away, Juancarlo Parkhurst still had a few hours before his restaurant, Lina\u2019s Diner and Bar, opened for dinner. <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">He\u2019d heard rumors that Discovery might be pulling out of the area for more than a year, but on Tuesday, he was forced to deal with the prospect of losing much of his happy-hour crowd of Discovery employees.\n</span>Parkhurst said Discovery was \u201creally big in helping the renaissance of Silver Spring\u201d but also helped drive rent increases that were straining tenants.\n<span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">\u201cNow that there\u2019s no longer this anchor tenant and thousands of employees, it\u2019s very scary as a business operator,\u201d Parkhurst said.\n</span>Discovery\u2019s decision dealt a potentially fatal setback to ambitions in the Washington area to become a major player in the entertainment industry.\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Economists said consolidation among media companies has already helped fuel an exodus in the sector.</span> BET Networks, the country\u2019s largest cable network for African American audiences, relocated its headquarters from Northeast Washington to New York last summer.

But Discovery was the flagship company for this region\u2019s hopes to secure a permanent niche in the industry.\n\u201cWe have advocacy media and are the information center for political reasons, but not necessarily for documentaries or film entertainment,\u201d Buchanan said.\n<span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Business leaders said Discovery\u2019s decision highlighted the importance for the Washington region to promote economic sectors where the area already enjoys a competitive advantage and thus has good prospects to succeed.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Such sectors include cybersecurity, biotechnology, hospitality and financial services, industries with leading companies in the Washington area.</span> A Silver Spring pharmaceutical company, United Therapeutics, has been expanding.\n<span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">The Greater Washington Partnership, an alliance of chief executives of large employers, last month urged greater efforts in the area to train digital technology workers to aid all of those sectors.\n</span>\u201cRegions need to focus on their strengths,\u201d said Peter L.

What are the growth sectors, and how do we continue to nurture them?\u201d\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">The need to do more to promote growth separate from the federal government has become acute in recent years because of mandated government budget cuts in the process known as sequestration.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Economic growth has been weak <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2010,</span> compared with other big metro areas, as the region struggles to add new, well-paying jobs.</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">The jobs it has added \u2014 many of them in the service industry \u2014 are often low-paid positions with high turnover rates.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Among the country\u2019<span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 15 largest</span> metropolitan areas, the Washington region ranks last in job creation and income growth, according to data from the Stephen S. Fuller Institute at GMU.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">As Discovery showed by shipping low-end jobs to Tennessee, the Washington region struggles to compete when business costs are a factor.\n</span>Montgomery and Maryland officials offered undisclosed incentives to Discovery to offset the lower costs in Knoxville, but the gap was too wide to bridge.\n<span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">\u201cThere\u2019s no question it\u2019s cheaper to do business in Knoxville,\u201d said Leavy, the Discovery executive.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">\u201cThey don\u2019t have a state income tax.</span> Property values are in <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 40 percent</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 50 percent</span> range,\u201d compared with those in Montgomery, he said.\n<span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Discovery also pointed to other cost advantages in Tennessee.</span> <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">According to <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2017 business</span> tax index, it said, Tennessee ranked 13th best while Maryland was 42nd.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Tennessee\u2019s corporate income tax rate <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">is 6.5 percent</span>, compared with Maryland\u2019<span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 8.25 percent</span>.</span> <span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">According to the Council for Community and Economic Research, the cost of living in Knoxville <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 41 percent</span> below that of Silver Spring, Rockville and Frederick.\n</span>Discovery\u2019s move did not come as a surprise to close observers of the company. It has cut its workforce in Silver Spring by nearly half over the past decade. Chief executive David Zaslav, a native New Yorker who took over the company <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2007,</span> has been living in Manhattan in recent years even though the company\u2019s headquarters was in Maryland.\n\u201cWhen the new guy came in, there didn\u2019t seem to be any connection between him and the county, between him and Silver Spring,\u201d Duncan, the former county executive, said.\nThat was in contrast with Discovery\u2019s founder, John Hendricks, who had close relations with Duncan and other local officials. A West Virginia native, Hendricks was running a Maryland consulting firm before he launched Discovery <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1985 with</span> <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $5 million</span> investment from Allen & Co., a boutique New York investment firm known for its media expertise.

(Want this by email? Sign up here.)\nFounders may think twice about selling to Facebook\nSelling your start-up to Facebook will make you rich, but it might not make you happy. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, who sold Instagram to the social networking giant for <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $715 million</span>, resigned earlier this week, reportedly over tensions with Mark Zuckerberg about growth.\nBrian Acton, one of the co-founders who sold WhatsApp to Facebook <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for $22 billion</span>, went further. In a dishy interview with Forbes, he spoke of similar tensions with Mr. Zuckerberg. (Facebook wanted ads; he didn\u2019t.)\n\u201cThey are businesspeople, they are good businesspeople,\u201d Mr. Acton said. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">\u201cThey just represent a set of business practices, principles and ethics, and policies that I don\u2019t necessarily agree with.\u201d\n</span>A senior Facebook executive, David Marcus, pushed back against Mr. Acton, writing in a post that \u201cattacking the people and company that made you a billionaire\u201d is \u201ca whole new standard of low-class.\u201d\nYes, founders take their money and make a choice. But Facebook\u2019s acquisition strategy appears to be stuttering, and its newer products may head in unexpected directions with their founders out of the picture. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s a problem: Facebook\u2019s acquisitions have been oases of calm and growth compared to its main business.\n</span>SoftBank\u2019s founder has the biggest dreams in tech\nMasa Son has raised <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly $100 billion</span> for his company\u2019s Vision Fund to invest in tech companies, on what he says is a 300-year strategy. But in a Bloomberg Businessweek profile, he says that\u2019s only the start: He wants to raise <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">another $100 billion</span> every two or three years, and expand the Vision Fund\u2019s team of deal makers <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 300.</span> Counting him, it\u2019s currently ten.\nThat\u2019s an incredible amount of money, and competing investment firms are (understandably) frightened. It\u2019s very different at start-ups, Businessweek points out:\nSoftBank has given them the equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet of foreign investment dollars. \u201cYou think they can\u2019t eat any more,\u201d says Jules Maltz, a partner with IVP, a Sand Hill Road firm. The entrepreneurs \u201ccram it in, put it in their pockets, take doggy bags, whatever.\u201d\nThe bigger worry might be to SoftBank\u2019s investors: The Vision Fund will need a lot of home-run investments to cover bets that huge.\nSilicon Valley tells lawmakers to go easy on regulation\nExecutives from Google, Apple, AT&T and more appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee yesterday to answer privacy questions. <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe have arrived at a moment where, I believe, there is a strong desire by both Republicans and Democrats, and by both industry and public interest groups, to work in good faith to reach a consensus on a national consumer data privacy law,\u201d Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the committee\u2019s chairman, said in an opening statement.\n</span>But a clear message emerged from the tech giants: Don\u2019t go too far.\n\u2022 Amazon\u2019s associate general counsel, Andrew DeVore, asked lawmakers to \u201censure that additional overhead and administration demands any legislation might require actually produce commensurate privacy benefits.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u2022 Keith Enright, Google\u2019s new chief privacy officer, told them to \u201ctake into consideration the impacts on service functionality, the consumer benefits of free and low-cost products, the future of the open web and app ecosystem.\u201d\n</span>Nothing will happen quickly. \u201cI think we might have a pretty good idea what a draft would look like,\u201d Mr. Thune concluded. \u201cBut I suspect we probably wouldn\u2019t get it acted on until next year.\u201d\nRead more: It\u2019s Google\u2019s turn in the Washington hot seat.

onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2023,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n\nMay\u2019s increase was driven in part by sharp rises in the prices for energy, which <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 34.6% from</span> a year earlier, and groceries, which <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">jumped 11.9% on</span> the year, the biggest increase <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1979.</span></span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">But inflation pressures were distinctly broad-based in May, said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.\n\n</span>\u201cGiven everything from the implications of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Chinese lockdowns and just the sheer appetite for travel...what we\u2019ve seen is the perfect storm of those factors hitting, along with some major refinery closures,\u201d she said. \u201cInflationary pressures were seen nearly everywhere.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The inflation news hit stock and bond prices, with investors\u2019 fearing the Federal Reserve could be forced to act more aggressively to tame surging price increases.\n\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Prices for used cars and trucks\u2014a key engine of the past year\u2019s inflation surge\u2014<span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 1.8% in</span> May from April, reversing three months of declines.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Shelter costs, an indicator of broad inflation pressures, accelerated on a monthly basis in May and were <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 5.5%,</span> compared with a year ago.\n\n</span>Airline fares <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 12.6% on</span> the month, the third straight double-digit rise.\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe suspect that the formidable momentum in inflation could push the headline rate for CPI close <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 9% as</span> early as next month,\u201d said Ms. House, adding that it is likely to stay near those levels through the autumn.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The May inflation figures came as consumer sentiment soured further on the economy.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The preliminary estimate of the consumer sentiment index published Friday by the University of Michigan fell <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 50.2 in</span> June <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 58.4 in</span> May, marking its lowest reading on record.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Nearly half of those surveyed attributed their negative views to inflation, up <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 38% the</span> prior month, and long-term inflation expectations rose to the highest level <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2008.</span>\n\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">High inflation is a downside of strong U.S. growth, fueled in part by low interest rates and government stimulus to counter the Covid-19 pandemic\u2019s impact.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The annual rate of inflation has risen sharply since <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2021,</span> when the U.S. economy\u2019s rebound from the pandemic accelerated, leading to supply disruptions and other imbalances that put upward pressure on prices for longer than policy makers anticipated.\n\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The Fed faces the difficult task of tightening monetary policy enough to cool the economy and calm inflation, while avoiding a recession.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Fed officials on <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 4 lifted</span> rates by a half-percentage point and will meet again next week to consider a similar increase.\n\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Economists and policy makers had been watching closely for signs that inflationary pressures are ebbing.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">But May\u2019s resurgence in price increases ratchets up pressure on the Fed to raise rates aggressively to tame inflation, said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.\n\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe breadth of inflation pressures in the economy should alarm the Fed,\u201d he said.\n\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">On a monthly basis, the CPI jumped a seasonally <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">adjusted 1% in</span> May after <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rising 0.3% in</span> the prior month.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">The so-called core-price index, which excludes the often volatile categories of food and energy, <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">increased 0.6% on</span> the month, the same as in April.</span> That compares with an average monthly gain <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 0.2% for</span> both measures in the two years before the pandemic.\n\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">On a 12-month basis, the core-price index <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">increased 6% in</span> May, down <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 6.2% in</span> April.</span> March\u2019<span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 6.5% rise</span> was the highest rate since <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">August 1982.</span>\n\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Inflation was highest in the South, <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 9.2%,</span> and the Midwest, where prices <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 8.8%.</span></span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Residents of the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater area of Florida swallowed <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an 11.3% increase</span> over <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 12 months</span> ended in May, driven in part by a sharp rise in rental prices.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Inflation was <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 6.3% in</span> the New York City metropolitan area, due in part to relatively low rental-price gains.\n\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">\u201cI understand inflation is a real challenge to American families,\u201d said President Biden, speaking at the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, Calif.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">He added the administration would do \u201ceverything we can to lower prices for the American people and Congress has to act,\u201d and cited efforts to reduce backlogs of supplies at U.S. ports.\n\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Energy prices rose in May as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine continued to push up prices for crude-oil and natural gas.</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Gasoline prices have breached record levels in recent weeks.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">The average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gas in the U.S. <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">hit $5 Friday</span> night, according to OPIS, an energy-data and analytics provider.\n\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">The strength in energy price rises will keep putting upward pressure on inflation, said Ms. House, the Wells Fargo economist.\n\n</span>Consumers\u2019 grocery bills have risen by an annual rate of more <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 10% since</span> earlier this year, a pace last seen in the early 1980s. <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Food price increases are unusually broad, and every single grocery category measured in the report rose in May from a year ago\u2014most of them by double digits.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">There are numerous causes, unlike early in the pandemic when meat prices drove much of the increase, said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.\n\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s not just the weather\u2014it\u2019s diseases affecting citrus trees and chickens. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">It\u2019s the Ukraine conflict,\u201d which has affected prices for baked goods and cereals, he said.</span> <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Drought, too, is hitting prices for vegetables and other crops.\n\n</span>\u201cFor people on lower incomes, this is not discretionary spending,\u201d Mr. Ashworth said. \u201cOther than substituting out cheaper food types\u2014cheaper meat cuts, whatever it might be\u2014people need to continue buying food.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Price pressures are strong across much of the economy in part because of an unusually tight U.S. labor market, with demand for workers outstripping supply.</span> <span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Employers <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">added 390,000 jobs</span> last month, and the unemployment rate hovered near a half-century low.</span> <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Still, even after the economy gained more <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 6.5 million</span> jobs in the space of a year, fewer Americans are employed as a share of the population than before the pandemic.\n\n</span><span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">Those dynamics are driving wage growth, adding to inflationary pressures.</span> <span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">Strong gains in wages and hiring are pumping more money into Americans\u2019 bank accounts, propping up demand as inflation erodes spending power for many.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">Meanwhile, higher labor costs stemming from worker shortages are prompting many employers to raise prices.\n\n</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">Demand for travel and other services has surged as the impact of Covid-19 recedes and people spend more freely on experiences they missed out on during the worst of the pandemic.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">This is pushing up prices for these services.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Airline fares <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">surged 37.8% from</span> a year ago, while hotel prices <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">were 19.3% higher</span>.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">Restaurant prices <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 7.4%,</span> the sharpest rise <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1981.</span>\n\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">Despite strong demand for summer activities such as travel, higher prices are eating into many business owners\u2019 profitability.</span> In <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2020,</span> Suzanne Hoffman, an author who runs wine tours in Italy, canceled group tours to Piedmont because of the pandemic. A number of guests rolled over their deposits and are finally taking their trips this summer.\n\n<span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe demand is there; people are just champing at the bit,\u201d said Ms. Hoffman, who is based in Edwards, Colo.\n\n</span><span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">But the people taking those long-delayed trips are <span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">paying 2019 prices</span>, she said, while fuel, dining and other costs to conduct the tours have gone up.</span> That is hurting Ms. Hoffman\u2019s bottom line to the extent that she might stop running future tours given the uncertain outlook.\n\n\u201cI canceled my October tour. I just don\u2019t want to make any commitments beyond this summer,\u201d she said.\n\n<span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">Some main drivers of inflation could be easing.\n\n</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">The backlog in cargo ships waiting to unload in Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., fell for the fourth straight month in May, said Oren Klachkin of Oxford Economics.</span> Target Corp. recently said the need to unload unwanted goods would cause its profit to drop. Clothes retailers have also been caught with swelling inventories of casual clothes and home items as shoppers scaled back spending on goods that had been popular throughout the pandemic.\n\n<span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">But supply bottlenecks are easing too slowly and too sporadically to ease inflationary pressures, economists say.</span> <span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">Energy disruptions caused by the Ukraine war and the lack of workers to fill vacancies in the U.S. are exacerbating strains on the economy\u2019s ability to meet demand without price rises.\n\n</span><span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">The breadth and persistence of these supply problems means that for inflation to ease, demand must come down, said Mr. Knightley of ING.</span> <span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">\u201cTo get demand into better balance with the supply the onus is on the Federal Reserve to do the heavy lifting,\u201d he said.\n\n</span>Harriet Torry contributed to this article.\n\n<span id=\"55\"

onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2023,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n\nMay\u2019s increase was driven in part by sharp rises in the prices for energy, which <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 34.6% from</span> a year earlier, and groceries, which <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">jumped 11.9% on</span> the year, the biggest increase <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1979.</span></span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">But inflation pressures were distinctly broad-based in May, said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.\n\n</span>\u201cGiven everything from the implications of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Chinese lockdowns and just the sheer appetite for travel...what we\u2019ve seen is the perfect storm of those factors hitting, along with some major refinery closures,\u201d she said. \u201cInflationary pressures were seen nearly everywhere.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The inflation news hit stock and bond prices, with investors\u2019 fearing the Federal Reserve could be forced to act more aggressively to tame surging price increases.\n\n</span><span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">Prices for used cars and trucks\u2014a key engine of the past year\u2019s inflation surge\u2014<span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 1.8% in</span> May from April, reversing three months of declines.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Shelter costs, an indicator of broad inflation pressures, accelerated on a monthly basis in May and were <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">up 5.5%,</span> compared with a year ago.\n\n</span>Airline fares <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 12.6% on</span> the month, the third straight double-digit rise.\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe suspect that the formidable momentum in inflation could push the headline rate for CPI close <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 9% as</span> early as next month,\u201d said Ms. House, adding that it is likely to stay near those levels through the autumn.\n\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The May inflation figures came as consumer sentiment soured further on the economy.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">The preliminary estimate of the consumer sentiment index published Friday by the University of Michigan fell <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 50.2 in</span> June <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 58.4 in</span> May, marking its lowest reading on record.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Nearly half of those surveyed attributed their negative views to inflation, up <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 38% the</span> prior month, and long-term inflation expectations rose to the highest level <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2008.</span>\n\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">High inflation is a downside of strong U.S. growth, fueled in part by low interest rates and government stimulus to counter the Covid-19 pandemic\u2019s impact.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The annual rate of inflation has risen sharply since <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2021,</span> when the U.S. economy\u2019s rebound from the pandemic accelerated, leading to supply disruptions and other imbalances that put upward pressure on prices for longer than policy makers anticipated.\n\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The Fed faces the difficult task of tightening monetary policy enough to cool the economy and calm inflation, while avoiding a recession.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">Fed officials on <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 4 lifted</span> rates by a half-percentage point and will meet again next week to consider a similar increase.\n\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Economists and policy makers had been watching closely for signs that inflationary pressures are ebbing.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">But May\u2019s resurgence in price increases ratchets up pressure on the Fed to raise rates aggressively to tame inflation, said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.\n\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe breadth of inflation pressures in the economy should alarm the Fed,\u201d he said.\n\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">On a monthly basis, the CPI jumped a seasonally <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">adjusted 1% in</span> May after <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rising 0.3% in</span> the prior month.</span> <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">The so-called core-price index, which excludes the often volatile categories of food and energy, <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">increased 0.6% on</span> the month, the same as in April.</span> That compares with an average monthly gain <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 0.2% for</span> both measures in the two years before the pandemic.\n\n<span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">On a 12-month basis, the core-price index <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">increased 6% in</span> May, down <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 6.2% in</span> April.</span> March\u2019<span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 6.5% rise</span> was the highest rate since <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">August 1982.</span>\n\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Inflation was highest in the South, <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 9.2%,</span> and the Midwest, where prices <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 8.8%.</span></span> <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Residents of the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater area of Florida swallowed <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">an 11.3% increase</span> over <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 12 months</span> ended in May, driven in part by a sharp rise in rental prices.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Inflation was <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 6.3% in</span> the New York City metropolitan area, due in part to relatively low rental-price gains.\n\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">\u201cI understand inflation is a real challenge to American families,\u201d said President Biden, speaking at the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, Calif.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">He added the administration would do \u201ceverything we can to lower prices for the American people and Congress has to act,\u201d and cited efforts to reduce backlogs of supplies at U.S. ports.\n\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Energy prices rose in May as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine continued to push up prices for crude-oil and natural gas.</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Gasoline prices have breached record levels in recent weeks.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">The average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gas in the U.S. <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">hit $5 Friday</span> night, according to OPIS, an energy-data and analytics provider.\n\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">The strength in energy price rises will keep putting upward pressure on inflation, said Ms. House, the Wells Fargo economist.\n\n</span>Consumers\u2019 grocery bills have risen by an annual rate of more <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 10% since</span> earlier this year, a pace last seen in the early 1980s. <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Food price increases are unusually broad, and every single grocery category measured in the report rose in May from a year ago\u2014most of them by double digits.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">There are numerous causes, unlike early in the pandemic when meat prices drove much of the increase, said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.\n\n</span>\u201cIt\u2019s not just the weather\u2014it\u2019s diseases affecting citrus trees and chickens. <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">It\u2019s the Ukraine conflict,\u201d which has affected prices for baked goods and cereals, he said.</span> <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Drought, too, is hitting prices for vegetables and other crops.\n\n</span>\u201cFor people on lower incomes, this is not discretionary spending,\u201d Mr. Ashworth said. \u201cOther than substituting out cheaper food types\u2014cheaper meat cuts, whatever it might be\u2014people need to continue buying food.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Price pressures are strong across much of the economy in part because of an unusually tight U.S. labor market, with demand for workers outstripping supply.</span> <span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Employers <span id=\"58\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">added 390,000 jobs</span> last month, and the unemployment rate hovered near a half-century low.</span> <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Still, even after the economy gained more <span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 6.5 million</span> jobs in the space of a year, fewer Americans are employed as a share of the population than before the pandemic.\n\n</span><span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">Those dynamics are driving wage growth, adding to inflationary pressures.</span> <span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">Strong gains in wages and hiring are pumping more money into Americans\u2019 bank accounts, propping up demand as inflation erodes spending power for many.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">Meanwhile, higher labor costs stemming from worker shortages are prompting many employers to raise prices.\n\n</span><span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">Demand for travel and other services has surged as the impact of Covid-19 recedes and people spend more freely on experiences they missed out on during the worst of the pandemic.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">This is pushing up prices for these services.</span> <span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Airline fares <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">surged 37.8% from</span> a year ago, while hotel prices <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">were 19.3% higher</span>.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">Restaurant prices <span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rose 7.4%,</span> the sharpest rise <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 1981.</span>\n\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">Despite strong demand for summer activities such as travel, higher prices are eating into many business owners\u2019 profitability.</span> In <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2020,</span> Suzanne Hoffman, an author who runs wine tours in Italy, canceled group tours to Piedmont because of the pandemic. A number of guests rolled over their deposits and are finally taking their trips this summer.\n\n<span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe demand is there; people are just champing at the bit,\u201d said Ms. Hoffman, who is based in Edwards, Colo.\n\n</span><span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">But the people taking those long-delayed trips are <span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">paying 2019 prices</span>, she said, while fuel, dining and other costs to conduct the tours have gone up.</span> That is hurting Ms. Hoffman\u2019s bottom line to the extent that she might stop running future tours given the uncertain outlook.\n\n\u201cI canceled my October tour. I just don\u2019t want to make any commitments beyond this summer,\u201d she said.\n\n<span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">Some main drivers of inflation could be easing.\n\n</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">The backlog in cargo ships waiting to unload in Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., fell for the fourth straight month in May, said Oren Klachkin of Oxford Economics.</span> Target Corp. recently said the need to unload unwanted goods would cause its profit to drop. Clothes retailers have also been caught with swelling inventories of casual clothes and home items as shoppers scaled back spending on goods that had been popular throughout the pandemic.\n\n<span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">But supply bottlenecks are easing too slowly and too sporadically to ease inflationary pressures, economists say.</span> <span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">Energy disruptions caused by the Ukraine war and the lack of workers to fill vacancies in the U.S. are exacerbating strains on the economy\u2019s ability to meet demand without price rises.\n\n</span><span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">The breadth and persistence of these supply problems means that for inflation to ease, demand must come down, said Mr. Knightley of ING.</span> <span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">\u201cTo get demand into better balance with the supply the onus is on the Federal Reserve to do the heavy lifting,\u201d he said.\n\n</span>Harriet Torry contributed to this article.\n\n<span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">Write to Gwynn Guilford at gwynn.guilford@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\n\nAppeared in the <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 11,</span><span id=\"67\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2022,</span> print edition as 'Inflation Hits Four-Decade High'.</span>"}, "49697": {"id": "49697", "text": "<h3>Skiing Kosovo, Abandoned Lifts and All</h3>The flakes stumbled into the windows, gathered themselves and then wobbled on like revelers caught between pubs. At times it snowed so hard I could hardly see anything out there at all. A wood hut. A concrete wall. When the storm finally broke three days later, <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some 40 inches</span> of snow had fallen and everything sprang to life.\nThe timing was ideal. A few hours earlier, I had arrived in Pristina, the red-roofed capital of Kosovo, just as the first flakes corkscrewed their way to earth. It was February, frigid, and a worsted wool blanket stretched across the Balkan sky. I threw my skis into the back of a 4Runner with two Serbs I had hired to pick me up, and we rode south in silence toward the Sharr Mountains along the Macedonian border. In an hour we\u2019d be at Brezovica, the most delightfully dysfunctional ski resort in Europe.\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of Kosovo but not of skiing in Kosovo. Landlocked between Albania and Serbia, Kosovo was the last of the nations to congeal in the caldron of old Yugoslavia. For years it remained a largely autonomous province tucked in southwestern Serbia, but a full-blown war for independence erupted there <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1998 between</span> Orthodox Serbs and ethnic Albanians, who are Muslims. The fighting grew so ugly with a Serb-sponsored campaign of ethnic cleansing that NATO eventually intervened on the Albanians\u2019 behalf <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1999.</span> Today, to the United States and <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 110 other</span> countries that recognize it, Kosovo stands as Europe\u2019s newest country, an eight-year-old diamond of roughly two million friendly, westward-looking people still struggling to get on their feet.\nBut before all of that there was skiing, and Yugoslavia had plenty of it, from Kranjska Gora in the north to Papova Shapka in the south. The sport soared in popularity when the Olympics came to Bosnia <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1984 and</span> a Slovenian, Jure Franko, won silver in the giant slalom to clinch Yugoslavia\u2019s first Winter Olympic medal ever. Brezovica, <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 250 miles</span> southeast of Sarajevo, served as a backup for those games, but Yugoslavia\u2019s more hard-bitten skiers already knew the place for offering the steepest slopes and deepest powder for the fewest dinars.\nThere near the Serbian enclave of Strpce <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 35 miles</span> south of Pristina, storms slam into <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 8,000</span>-foot Sharr Mountains that rocket out of the Metohija basin with abrupt ridges and mighty shoulders cupping some of the continent\u2019s most extensive pasturelands. Back in the \u201980s, the resort\u2019s hey-decade,<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 10 lifts</span>, including five surface tows, serviced nine named runs, though the real magic happened in the go-anywhere terrain of the open north-facing bowls. D.J.s from Belgrade and Skopje kept the parties going until dawn. In the morning you might awake to find so much snow had fallen that even the wild chamois were stuck.\nBrezovica survived the wars but not the peace that followed.

Never mind Kosovo\u2019s rampant corruption and politics that are so cantankerous that politicians themselves have lobbed tear gas canisters in their own chambers at least six times in the last few months to disrupt their own proceedings.\nAnd yet there is hope.\n\u201cIf we can do this, we can do anything,\u201d said Manik Begolli, an Albanian Kosovar who worked on a public-private partnership team contracted by the United States Agency for International Development to help find an investor.\nMaybe. For the moment, though, I just hoped I could ski.\nSeven-Elevens have bigger parking lots than Brezovica\u2019s but that\u2019s where the Serbs dropped me off just after dark as the storm gathered intensity. Igor Nikolcevic met me there in a camouflage snowboard jacket. He <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 42,</span> a Serb with closely cropped hair and soulful eyes. He grabbed my ski bag and led me up an icy path to a pizzeria that he started with his wife, Draginja, and which he named after his daughter, Tina. Tina now lives in Pristina. I could have her room, fuzzy kitten posters and all.\nI followed Igor into the heart of the village, a collection of mostly hand-built cottages run by hangers-on who have eked out a living by offering basic services to the few who make it this far. There was the Cafe Braca and Restaurant Ljuboten. Skis lined the racks in a shop called Dane. The main chairlift out of the village, an ancient double chair, stood eerily quiet, the seats glazed in ice.\n\u201cWhat time will the lifts start running?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYou mean, if they start running,\u201d Igor replied.\nThat was actually an improvement over the last time I was here, <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013,</span> when INEX was hundreds of thousands of euros behind on its power bill and the utility company had cut electricity to the lifts. All was not lost. Instead, for \u20ac7 \u2014 <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $9 at</span> the time \u2014 the Dane guys would give you a ride to the top in a snow-grooming machine, where an entire resort\u2019s worth of untracked powder tugged at my tips.\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">It was some of the best skiing I\u2019d ever had for less than a nickel a turn: an unlimited supply of deep, creamy snow on a steep, consistent fall line.</span> Others just hiked up a small rise with sleds or sipped brandy outside while music pumped from competing loudspeakers. I loved the vibe and vowed to return.\nThis time, two years later, there was at least the possibility that the lifts might run. <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Sometime <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2014,</span></span> as the French were quietly studying the resort\u2019s prospects, a cadre of groups, including the Kosovo Electricity Corporation, local officials and the minister of trade and industry, hashed out a deal to get two of the chairlifts spinning again.</span> The equipment was still old, maybe even from the 1970s, and too unsafe to operate in a blizzard. I would have to wait for fairer skies to ride them.\nIgor pushed open a door and the pizzeria sighed a breath of warm air. Christmas lights hung from the log cabin frame and spilled a molten glow on the snow outside. Snowshoes, wooden skis and photographs of wintry scenes from the resort\u2019s early days decorated the walls. A fire crackled in the wood stove. A pizzeria in Kosovo is one of the coziest places I know.\nI took a seat at a long wooden table next to a local with an even longer face. His house two doors down had just succumbed to a chimney fire. With no firefighters to navigate the winding, snowy road up from Strpce in time, the men of the village had rallied to form a bucket brigade and fell a flame-licked tree. That saved the village but the house, a lovely wood and stone cottage, was a loss.\n\u201cIt went up like paper,\u201d said the owner, Andrej Kavcic. He poured two shots of slivovitz, the plum brandy, and handed me one. \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou pick yourself up and move on. What else.\u201d\nStoicism seems to be a national trait in Kosovo, but there is no mistaking that the country is picking itself up. <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Some 80 percent</span> of the population was displaced during the war. Now new furniture stores sit along new highways lined with new gas stations. The Pristina airport underwent a \u20ac180 million expansion <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013 and</span> is now the third-busiest airport in the old Yugoslavia after Belgrade and Zagreb. Problems persist, but the country is making strides to protect its landscape, integrate into Europe and normalize relations with Belgrade, the reason behind parliament\u2019s self-tear-gassing attacks.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The resort\u2019s rebirth comes at a time when Kosovo could really use jobs.</span> Drive around the country and you\u2019ll see smartly dressed people in cafes, in parks, in front of stores, anywhere but at work. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The resort could provide as many <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 3,000 jobs</span>, some temporary, many permanent, in a country where half the population is <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">under 30 and</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 58 percent</span> of the work force is \u201cinactive.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But more than that, travel insiders around the Balkans have long yearned to trade the region\u2019s oily image of strife for that of the crisp fabric of an emerging adventure-travel destination.</span> The efforts appear to be working. <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2014,</span></span><span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3.7 million</span> international tourists visited Albania, up from <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 645,000 in</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2004.</span> And in Montenegro, you can sea kayak through the watercress on Skadar Lake or catch feisty trout in green Macedonian streams, both with guides.\nFew Balkan countries beyond Croatia and Greece can entice transoceanic travelers as stand-alone destinations at the moment but, collectively, places like Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania can make for a wildly fascinating itinerary. Kosovo wants in on that action. Brezovica may be its best shot.\n\u201cKosovo is absolutely ready for something like this,\u201d said Pascal Roux, the chief executive of MDP Consulting and leader of the French consortium. \u201cBrezovica could be the pearl of the Balkans.\u201d\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Maybe so, but \u201cit\u2019s just hugely important to be sure it\u2019s done right,\u201d said Christopher Doyle, executive director for Europe of the Adventure Travel Trade Association, which champions sustainable adventure travel markets.</span> What is needed, he said, are \u201cthoughtful supporting efforts to engage the local community and protect the environment.\u201d\nAcross the Balkans, there is little doubt that skiing is having a moment. Ecosign, a Canadian mountain resort planning firm that has designed Alpine skiing venues for five Winter Olympics, has <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">completed 15 master</span> plans for new or drastically reorganized resorts, including three in Macedonia, four in Serbia and two in Greece. A Dubai-based firm in December announced plans to build <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $5 billion</span> \u201ctourist city\u201d with thousands of holiday homes near Bosnia\u2019s Bjelasnica mountain, where the Olympics were held. Kopaonik, Serbia\u2019s most developed ski resort, added a new six-person heated chairlift last year and a new hotel. Poiana Brasov in Romania recently spent \u20ac30 million expanding its terrain, adding snow-making and upgrading lifts.\nIf anyone stands to lose on the Brezovica deal, it\u2019s Igor. His grandfather, Radojko Nikolcevic, was the ski area\u2019s first general manager after the resort opened <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1954.</span> In the \u201970s he built a hut that would become Tina\u2019s pizzeria under Igor <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1993.</span> Today the Nikolcevices earn enough money selling pizzas in winter to last them the rest of the year. Now the consortium will level almost everything \u2014 the hotels, the village, the lifts. The Nikolcevices will get <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $250,000 in</span> expropriation fees, but money isn\u2019t the issue.\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy people want to invest in the resort but never in my life have I been as afraid for my future as I am right now,\u201d Igor said. \u201cThe mountains are in me.\u201d\nOver the next three days a frustrating pattern emerged. Each morning I awoke to another foot of snow, and each morning the lifts weren\u2019t running. The Dane guys weren\u2019t offering the seven-euro special. Hiking up alone would be misery. Still, I hoped for the best.\nI lounged around Tina\u2019s watching the snowflakes hit the windows or took naps under a shaggy blanket in Tina\u2019s old room. The Nikolcevices treated me like family. We sat near the fire talking about life in Kosovo. On the war: \u201cStupid politicians caused it.\u201d On being Serbs surrounded by Albanians: \u201cWe never have an argument.\u201d On why I should not clear the table: \u201cThis is Balkans,\u201d Draginja said. \u201cWomen do this.\u201d\nI helped anyway and then serviced my macho deficits by grabbing a shovel to clear snow off the pizzeria\u2019s roof. The electricity flickered on and off.\n\u201cThere is something beautiful when everything is broken,\u201d Draginja told me later over a meal of tangy mountain cheese, winter cabbage and a Serbian dish of shredded pork called duvan cvarci. \u201cEveryone comes together.\u201d\nOn the fourth day, the storm thinned into a delicate fog, and, miracle of miracles, the lifts creaked to life. At last I could ski.\nI raced out the door. Classic rock blared from the Che & Fox cafe. Vendors jammed folding tables into the snow to peddle Serbian beer, Austrian juices and Lucky Strikes. A man in the parking lot sat next to a delivery truck with a cardboard sign: ski rentals \u20ac5. I clicked into my own skis and scooted up to a double chair called Livada, or \u201cmeadow\u201d in Serbian. It rose lazily over an abandoned stone mansion called Stojko\u2019s house, one of the few buildings that will remain. A man stood next to the entrance ready to check my lift ticket. I didn\u2019t have one. I asked where to buy it.\n\u201cNo, no, you don\u2019t need a ticket,\u201d said a voice in English behind me. I turned to see two men on skis. One of them in a red jacket shuffled forward, said something in Serbian and pressed <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $3 worth</span> of coins into the attendant\u2019s palm. \u201cCome, come,\u201d my new friend said, and off we went.\nRexhep Krasniqi,<span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 58,</span> had fled <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Kosovo 23 years</span> ago as a refugee and now worked as a contractor in London. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">He had returned to ski with his younger brother, Isak, who had run a refugee camp in Macedonia before landing a job in finance.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Isak was now unemployed but not worried.</span> \u201cWe are good at surviving,\u201d he said.\nI spent most of the day skiing with the Krasniqis, who explained the ticket system. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">A price list said I could buy anything from a single ride <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 10 days</span> of unlimited rides, but almost no one consulted it.</span> Instead they negotiated rates with the attendant. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">A single ride cost <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $3.25,</span> though Rexhep had bargained to get both of us at least two rides for that.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">As best as I could tell a day pass cost <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $11.</span>\nNow, new for this winter, workers have installed an electronic ticket-reader and day passes have jumped to <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $21,</span> a fortune when the average worker earns <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $380 a</span> month.</span> \u201cNo more corruption,\u201d a local told me later, \u201cbut less skiers.\u201d\nWe picked our way through a steep notch called the Lion\u2019s Gate and found untracked lines through the trees. Wind-powered snow roared off the ridge behind us in great white flames. The snow hissed violently off the bottoms of my skis to form blue contrails. Most of the terrain was intermediate to expert-only. The revamped resort will have more beginner runs.\nEventually we stopped for lunch on a patio at a slopeside hut called Cafe Collmar, where a waiter brought us coffee, brandy and cheesy bread. Rexhep refused to let me pay <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $5 bill</span>. \u201cNo Albanian in Kosovo will ever let you pay,\u201d he said, politely but firmly. \u201cYou are American, and to us Americans are like Jesuses.\u201d\nMy last day dawned a piercing blue and the air shimmered with suspended snow crystals. This time Igor and a friend from Belgrade, Marko Nikolic, showed me a wild backcountry run that dropped through miles of open powder into a tight stream bed. Marko, a mountain guide, then invited me to climb to a high point in the resort,<span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8,274</span>-foot Pribreg mountain, where we could find the longest, most challenging runs back to the base.\nWe rode Livada up as high as it went, then I slung my skis over my shoulder and kicked steps up the sastrugi beyond the top station. We gained an easy ridge and made the summit <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 45 minutes</span>. A lift once came all the way up here but it hadn\u2019t worked in years, and the top wheelhouse was completely entombed in tons of feathered ice. The slope below was so steep it gave me vertigo.\nSoon all of this would be very different. I tried to picture a brand-new lift stitched into the rock, the sprawling village where Tina\u2019s once stood, and the legs I\u2019d need to ski all those new runs. I had one foot in Macedonia, the other in Kosovo, and five more countries in view.\nIt may have been selfish, but Brezovica felt perfect as is. We have so many polished resorts already but so few that can foster skiing at its most authentic without any flash. Even more selfish: What do you do when you know one of your favorite places to visit, a secret, is about to blow up? Don\u2019t you long for it to stay the way it is?\nBrezovica has to change, of course. As anyone in Kosovo knows, stop moving for long enough and someone will come bury you.\nMarko wasted no time. He strapped on his snowboard. I lowered my goggles. Then we both pushed off and floated through a beautiful, broken world.\nIF YOU GO\nGetting There\nPristina (PRN) and Skopje (SKP) are the closest airports to Brezovica. There are no direct flights to either city from the United States. Check fares on Turkish Airlines, Swiss, Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, SAS, EasyJet, Delta, Alitalia and Norwegian for connecting in Europe.\nWhat You Should Know\nThis winter will likely be the last to see Brezovica in all of its rundown glory. In its current state, the resort is not for everyone. The lifts may not run every day. There is no such thing as customer service. It\u2019s unclear what facilities will be open next winter. For updates check the Sar Planina-Brezovica Facebook page or the Brezovica Resort Facebook page. The ski area also has a website but it isn\u2019t very helpful: brezovica-ski.com.\nGuides\nHiring a guide to help you find a place to stay and arrange airport transfers is a must at the moment. Igor Nikolcevic is neither a guide nor an outfitter but he speaks very good English and can help arrange transfers, especially from Pristina, lift tickets, guides and lodging. Message him through the Pizzeria Tina Facebook page. Outdoor Albania, an outfitter based in Tirana, also runs custom trips to Brezovica. (OutdoorAlbania.com; info@outdooralbania.com).\nTransfers and Lift Tickets\nExpect to pay <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 50 euros</span> each way for transfers from Pristina. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Lift tickets now cost \u20ac20 a day.</span>", "displayed_text": "<h3>Skiing Kosovo, Abandoned Lifts and All</h3>The flakes stumbled into the windows, gathered themselves and then wobbled on like revelers caught between pubs. At times it snowed so hard I could hardly see anything out there at all. A wood hut. A concrete wall. When the storm finally broke three days later, <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">some 40 inches</span> of snow had fallen and everything sprang to life.\nThe timing was ideal. A few hours earlier, I had arrived in Pristina, the red-roofed capital of Kosovo, just as the first flakes corkscrewed their way to earth. It was February, frigid, and a worsted wool blanket stretched across the Balkan sky. I threw my skis into the back of a 4Runner with two Serbs I had hired to pick me up, and we rode south in silence toward the Sharr Mountains along the Macedonian border. In an hour we\u2019d be at Brezovica, the most delightfully dysfunctional ski resort in Europe.\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of Kosovo but not of skiing in Kosovo. Landlocked between Albania and Serbia, Kosovo was the last of the nations to congeal in the caldron of old Yugoslavia. For years it remained a largely autonomous province tucked in southwestern Serbia, but a full-blown war for independence erupted there <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1998 between</span> Orthodox Serbs and ethnic Albanians, who are Muslims. The fighting grew so ugly with a Serb-sponsored campaign of ethnic cleansing that NATO eventually intervened on the Albanians\u2019 behalf <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1999.</span> Today, to the United States and <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 110 other</span> countries that recognize it, Kosovo stands as Europe\u2019s newest country, an eight-year-old diamond of roughly two million friendly, westward-looking people still struggling to get on their feet.\nBut before all of that there was skiing, and Yugoslavia had plenty of it, from Kranjska Gora in the north to Papova Shapka in the south. The sport soared in popularity when the Olympics came to Bosnia <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1984 and</span> a Slovenian, Jure Franko, won silver in the giant slalom to clinch Yugoslavia\u2019s first Winter Olympic medal ever. Brezovica, <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 250 miles</span> southeast of Sarajevo, served as a backup for those games, but Yugoslavia\u2019s more hard-bitten skiers already knew the place for offering the steepest slopes and deepest powder for the fewest dinars.\nThere near the Serbian enclave of Strpce <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 35 miles</span> south of Pristina, storms slam into <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 8,000</span>-foot Sharr Mountains that rocket out of the Metohija basin with abrupt ridges and mighty shoulders cupping some of the continent\u2019s most extensive pasturelands. Back in the \u201980s, the resort\u2019s hey-decade,<span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 10 lifts</span>, including five surface tows, serviced nine named runs, though the real magic happened in the go-anywhere terrain of the open north-facing bowls. D.J.s from Belgrade and Skopje kept the parties going until dawn. In the morning you might awake to find so much snow had fallen that even the wild chamois were stuck.\nBrezovica survived the wars but not the peace that followed. Throughout the early 2000s, INEX, the Serbian socially owned enterprise that managed the resort, stopped investing in Brezovica and everything began to crumble. One of the main hotels, a graceless rectangular prism, became a drafty concrete husk. The disco floor went cold.

I would have to wait for fairer skies to ride them.\nIgor pushed open a door and the pizzeria sighed a breath of warm air. Christmas lights hung from the log cabin frame and spilled a molten glow on the snow outside. Snowshoes, wooden skis and photographs of wintry scenes from the resort\u2019s early days decorated the walls. A fire crackled in the wood stove. A pizzeria in Kosovo is one of the coziest places I know.\nI took a seat at a long wooden table next to a local with an even longer face. His house two doors down had just succumbed to a chimney fire. With no firefighters to navigate the winding, snowy road up from Strpce in time, the men of the village had rallied to form a bucket brigade and fell a flame-licked tree. That saved the village but the house, a lovely wood and stone cottage, was a loss.\n\u201cIt went up like paper,\u201d said the owner, Andrej Kavcic. He poured two shots of slivovitz, the plum brandy, and handed me one. \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou pick yourself up and move on. What else.\u201d\nStoicism seems to be a national trait in Kosovo, but there is no mistaking that the country is picking itself up. <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Some 80 percent</span> of the population was displaced during the war. Now new furniture stores sit along new highways lined with new gas stations. The Pristina airport underwent a \u20ac180 million expansion <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2013 and</span> is now the third-busiest airport in the old Yugoslavia after Belgrade and Zagreb. Problems persist, but the country is making strides to protect its landscape, integrate into Europe and normalize relations with Belgrade, the reason behind parliament\u2019s self-tear-gassing attacks.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The resort\u2019s rebirth comes at a time when Kosovo could really use jobs.</span> Drive around the country and you\u2019ll see smartly dressed people in cafes, in parks, in front of stores, anywhere but at work. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The resort could provide as many <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as 3,000 jobs</span>, some temporary, many permanent, in a country where half the population is <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">under 30 and</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 58 percent</span> of the work force is \u201cinactive.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">But more than that, travel insiders around the Balkans have long yearned to trade the region\u2019s oily image of strife for that of the crisp fabric of an emerging adventure-travel destination.</span> The efforts appear to be working. <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2014,</span></span><span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3.7 million</span> international tourists visited Albania, up from <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 645,000 in</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2004.</span> And in Montenegro, you can sea kayak through the watercress on Skadar Lake or catch feisty trout in green Macedonian streams, both with guides.\nFew Balkan countries beyond Croatia and Greece can entice transoceanic travelers as stand-alone destinations at the moment but, collectively, places like Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania can make for a wildly fascinating itinerary. Kosovo wants in on that action. Brezovica may be its best shot.\n\u201cKosovo is absolutely ready for something like this,\u201d said Pascal Roux, the chief executive of MDP Consulting and leader of the French consortium. \u201cBrezovica could be the pearl of the Balkans.\u201d\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Maybe so, but \u201cit\u2019s just hugely important to be sure it\u2019s done right,\u201d said Christopher Doyle, executive director for Europe of the Adventure Travel Trade Association, which champions sustainable adventure travel markets.</span> What is needed, he said, are \u201cthoughtful supporting efforts to engage the local community and protect the environment.\u201d\nAcross the Balkans, there is little doubt that skiing is having a moment. Ecosign, a Canadian mountain resort planning firm that has designed Alpine skiing venues for five Winter Olympics, has <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">completed 15 master</span> plans for new or drastically reorganized resorts, including three in Macedonia, four in Serbia and two in Greece. A Dubai-based firm in December announced plans to build <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $5 billion</span> \u201ctourist city\u201d with thousands of holiday homes near Bosnia\u2019s Bjelasnica mountain, where the Olympics were held. Kopaonik, Serbia\u2019s most developed ski resort, added a new six-person heated chairlift last year and a new hotel. Poiana Brasov in Romania recently spent \u20ac30 million expanding its terrain, adding snow-making and upgrading lifts.\nIf anyone stands to lose on the Brezovica deal, it\u2019s Igor. His grandfather, Radojko Nikolcevic, was the ski area\u2019s first general manager after the resort opened <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1954.</span> In the \u201970s he built a hut that would become Tina\u2019s pizzeria under Igor <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1993.</span> Today the Nikolcevices earn enough money selling pizzas in winter to last them the rest of the year. Now the consortium will level almost everything \u2014 the hotels, the village, the lifts. The Nikolcevices will get <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $250,000 in</span> expropriation fees, but money isn\u2019t the issue.\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy people want to invest in the resort but never in my life have I been as afraid for my future as I am right now,\u201d Igor said. \u201cThe mountains are in me.\u201d\nOver the next three days a frustrating pattern emerged. Each morning I awoke to another foot of snow, and each morning the lifts weren\u2019t running. The Dane guys weren\u2019t offering the seven-euro special. Hiking up alone would be misery. Still, I hoped for the best.\nI lounged around Tina\u2019s watching the snowflakes hit the windows or took naps under a shaggy blanket in Tina\u2019s old room. The Nikolcevices treated me like family. We sat near the fire talking about life in Kosovo. On the war: \u201cStupid politicians caused it.\u201d On being Serbs surrounded by Albanians: \u201cWe never have an argument.\u201d On why I should not clear the table: \u201cThis is Balkans,\u201d Draginja said. \u201cWomen do this.\u201d\nI helped anyway and then serviced my macho deficits by grabbing a shovel to clear snow off the pizzeria\u2019s roof. The electricity flickered on and off.\n\u201cThere is something beautiful when everything is broken,\u201d Draginja told me later over a meal of tangy mountain cheese, winter cabbage and a Serbian dish of shredded pork called duvan cvarci. \u201cEveryone comes together.\u201d\nOn the fourth day, the storm thinned into a delicate fog, and, miracle of miracles, the lifts creaked to life. At last I could ski.\nI raced out the door. Classic rock blared from the Che & Fox cafe. Vendors jammed folding tables into the snow to peddle Serbian beer, Austrian juices and Lucky Strikes. A man in the parking lot sat next to a delivery truck with a cardboard sign: ski rentals \u20ac5. I clicked into my own skis and scooted up to a double chair called Livada, or \u201cmeadow\u201d in Serbian. It rose lazily over an abandoned stone mansion called Stojko\u2019s house, one of the few buildings that will remain. A man stood next to the entrance ready to check my lift ticket. I didn\u2019t have one. I asked where to buy it.\n\u201cNo, no, you don\u2019t need a ticket,\u201d said a voice in English behind me. I turned to see two men on skis. One of them in a red jacket shuffled forward, said something in Serbian and pressed <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $3 worth</span> of coins into the attendant\u2019s palm. \u201cCome, come,\u201d my new friend said, and off we went.\nRexhep Krasniqi,<span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 58,</span> had fled <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Kosovo 23 years</span> ago as a refugee and now worked as a contractor in London. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">He had returned to ski with his younger brother, Isak, who had run a refugee camp in Macedonia before landing a job in finance.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Isak was now unemployed but not worried.</span> \u201cWe are good at surviving,\u201d he said.\nI spent most of the day skiing with the Krasniqis, who explained the ticket system. <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">A price list said I could buy anything from a single ride <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 10 days</span> of unlimited rides, but almost no one consulted it.</span> Instead they negotiated rates with the attendant. <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">A single ride cost <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $3.25,</span> though Rexhep had bargained to get both of us at least two rides for that.</span> <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">As best as I could tell a day pass cost <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $11.</span>\nNow, new for this winter, workers have installed an electronic ticket-reader and day passes have jumped to <span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $21,</span> a fortune when the average worker earns <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $380 a</span> month.</span> \u201cNo more corruption,\u201d a local told me later, \u201cbut less skiers.\u201d\nWe picked our way through a steep notch called the Lion\u2019s Gate and found untracked lines through the trees. Wind-powered snow roared off the ridge behind us in great white flames. The snow hissed violently off the bottoms of my skis to form blue contrails. Most of the terrain was intermediate to expert-only. The revamped resort will have more beginner runs.\nEventually we stopped for lunch on a patio at a slopeside hut called Cafe Collmar, where a waiter brought us coffee, brandy and cheesy bread. Rexhep refused to let me pay <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $5 bill</span>. \u201cNo Albanian in Kosovo will ever let you pay,\u201d he said, politely but firmly. \u201cYou are American, and to us Americans are like Jesuses.\u201d\nMy last day dawned a piercing blue and the air shimmered with suspended snow crystals. This time Igor and a friend from Belgrade, Marko Nikolic, showed me a wild backcountry run that dropped through miles of open powder into a tight stream bed. Marko, a mountain guide, then invited me to climb to a high point in the resort,<span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8,274</span>-foot Pribreg mountain, where we could find the longest, most challenging runs back to the base.\nWe rode Livada up as high as it went, then I slung my skis over my shoulder and kicked steps up the sastrugi beyond the top station. We gained an easy ridge and made the summit <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 45 minutes</span>. A lift once came all the way up here but it hadn\u2019t worked in years, and the top wheelhouse was completely entombed in tons of feathered ice. The slope below was so steep it gave me vertigo.\nSoon all of this would be very different. I tried to picture a brand-new lift stitched into the rock, the sprawling village where Tina\u2019s once stood, and the legs I\u2019d need to ski all those new runs. I had one foot in Macedonia, the other in Kosovo, and five more countries in view.\nIt may have been selfish, but Brezovica felt perfect as is. We have so many polished resorts already but so few that can foster skiing at its most authentic without any flash. Even more selfish: What do you do when you know one of your favorite places to visit, a secret, is about to blow up? Don\u2019t you long for it to stay the way it is?\nBrezovica has to change, of course. As anyone in Kosovo knows, stop moving for long enough and someone will come bury you.\nMarko wasted no time. He strapped on his snowboard. I lowered my goggles. Then we both pushed off and floated through a beautiful, broken world.\nIF YOU GO\nGetting There\nPristina (PRN) and Skopje (SKP) are the closest airports to Brezovica. There are no direct flights to either city from the United States. Check fares on Turkish Airlines, Swiss, Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, SAS, EasyJet, Delta, Alitalia and Norwegian for connecting in Europe.\nWhat You Should Know\nThis winter will likely be the last to see Brezovica in all of its rundown glory. In its current state, the resort is not for everyone. The lifts may not run every day. There is no such thing as customer service. It\u2019s unclear what facilities will be open next winter. For updates check the Sar Planina-Brezovica Facebook page or the Brezovica Resort Facebook page. The ski area also has a website but it isn\u2019t very helpful: brezovica-ski.com.\nGuides\nHiring a guide to help you find a place to stay and arrange airport transfers is a must at the moment. Igor Nikolcevic is neither a guide nor an outfitter but he speaks very good English and can help arrange transfers, especially from Pristina, lift tickets, guides and lodging. Message him through the Pizzeria Tina Facebook page. Outdoor Albania, an outfitter based in Tirana, also runs custom trips to Brezovica. (OutdoorAlbania.com; info@outdooralbania.com).\nTransfers and Lift Tickets\nExpect to pay <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 50 euros</span> each way for transfers from Pristina. <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Lift tickets now cost \u20ac20 a day.</span>"}, "93529": {"id": "93529", "text": "<h3>Disney\u2019s New Pricing Magic: More Profit From Fewer Park Visitors</h3>Aug.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2022 12</span>:00 am ET\n\nWalt Disney used to call Disneyland his \u201cmagic kingdom.\u201d These days, Walt Disney Co.

2023,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n\nThe outcome is a bonanza for Disney: <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Even as the company limits the number of visitors and keeps attendance at its U.S. theme parks below prepandemic levels, they are generating record sales and profits.\n\n</span>The results reflect a major strategic shift on Disney\u2019s part, where the company is focused less on maximizing the quantity of visitors and more on increasing how much money each visitor spends, an approach the company refers to as yield management. Improving the visitor experience, the thinking goes, will prompt guests to spend more hours\u2014and therefore more money\u2014at the parks because they are having such a good time.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The biggest change in the past two years\u2014and the most lucrative for Disney\u2014is the introduction of a smartphone-app feature called Genie+ that <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">costs $15 per</span> person a day, on top of the price of admission, and allows parkgoers to skip the unreserved lines for some attractions, which the company refers to as \u201cstandby.\u201d</span> But Genie+ doesn\u2019t cover everything. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">To skip the standby lines at the most sought-after attractions, including some Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy-themed rides, reservations now cost an <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">additional $10 to</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $17.</span></span> Standby waits for popular attractions can last hours.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">At the same time, many benefits that used to be free\u2014from parking for certain annual passholders to airport shuttles to MagicBand wristbands that serve as combination hotel-room keys and park passes\u2014have been eliminated or now come with a price.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Disney has raised prices on hotel rooms, food and merchandise over the past year as inflation has climbed to record levels in the U.S.\n\nDisney\u2019s theme-park pricing is determined by \u201cpure supply and demand,\u201d said a company spokeswoman.</span> \u201cNo different than airplanes, hotels or cruise ships.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">In the quarter that ended Jan.<span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1,</span> Disney\u2019s domestic parks set records in both quarterly revenue and operating income, then broke both of them six months later.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">For the quarter that ended <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2,</span> the business unit that includes the theme parks also posted record revenue <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $5.42 billion</span> and record operating income <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $1.65 billion</span>.\n\nJosh D\u2019Amaro, the chairman of Disney\u2019s parks, experiences and products division, said that the changes have given visitors more choice about how to spend their time and money at the parks, while at the same time making the parks \u201cextremely commercially successful.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">In <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fiscal 2021,</span> the first year that both of Disney\u2019s two main U.S. resorts had reopened following the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, attendance at Disney\u2019s U.S. parks fell <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 17% compared</span> with the previous year, the company reported, but per-capita spending by guests grew <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 17%,</span> or nearly three times the average annual growth rate during the previous decade.</span> Disney doesn\u2019t disclose attendance for its theme parks.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">At the same time, the changes driving the increases in revenue and profit have drawn the ire of what Disney calls \u201clegacy fans,\u201d or longtime parks loyalists, including annual passholders who feel they are being pushed to the side in favor of big-spending families taking once-a-year, or even a once-in-a-lifetime, vacations.\n\n</span>\u201cDisney has this love-hate relationship with annual passholders,\u201d said Len Testa, a computer scientist who runs Touring Plans, a travel company that offers apps to help visitors find deals and navigate their trips to Walt Disney World and publishes a popular guide to Disney theme parks.\n\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">On one hand, they provide a reliable source of revenue\u2014the investment bank UBS estimated early last year that annual passholders at Disneyland account for about one half of annual visits\u2014but on the other, annual passholders tend to spend less than other visitors per visit, Mr. Testa said.\n\n</span>A typical annual pass holder might ride only one ride during a visit, eat an ice cream cone and walk around for a few hours, taking up capacity that might otherwise be used by out-of-state visitors, Mr. Testa said.\n\n\u201cThose people would have stayed all day,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would have eaten multiple times in the restaurants, they may have stayed in the hotel. They would definitely be buying more merchandise.\u201d\n\nSince its introduction in the fall <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2021,</span> Genie+ has become an increasingly popular tool. About half of visitors to the parks pay for and use Genie+, Disney said in a recent conference call with Wall Street analysts. And of those who pay for Genie+,<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 70% say</span> in post-visit surveys that they plan to do so again, Disney says.\n\nDisney has stopped selling nearly all new annual passes to Disneyland and Walt Disney World and has done away with a host of free perks that annual passholders used to enjoy. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Existing annual passholders can renew their passes, although earlier this month, the company raised the renewal price for its highest-tier annual passes to Disneyland <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 14%,</span> <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $1,599 from</span><span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $1,399,</span> while at the same time introducing more blackout days when passholders can\u2019t visit, angering some of the park\u2019s most ardent fans.\n\n</span>The parks have grown considerably since Walt Disney World opened <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1971.</span> Over the past decade, Disney has added rides based on popular franchises such as Star Wars, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Toy Story films and <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2009 film</span> \u201cAvatar.\u201d A roller coaster at Magic Kingdom based on the Tron films is under construction.\n\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The parks business has buoyed Disney\u2019s stock price and boosted financial results at a time when the company is losing billions on other businesses, like the popular but cost-heavy Disney+ streaming service.\n\n</span>Mr. D\u2019Amaro, the parks chief, is a 24-year veteran of the company who ran both Disneyland and Walt Disney World individually in previous roles.\n\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">He keeps a high profile with fans and employees, making frequent appearances at the parks outside of major events and posting about his visits on social media.\n\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">By contrast, his predecessor, Bob Chapek, who is now Disney\u2019s chief executive, walked the park grounds less frequently and wasn\u2019t as outgoing with visitors, according to Disney employees who worked under him.\n\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">On a recent, hourlong walk through Disneyland, Mr. D\u2019Amaro was stopped more <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 20 times</span> by visitors and cast members\u2014as Disney employees are known in company lingo\u2014who asked to take selfies with him and thanked him for his work.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Mr. D\u2019Amaro <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">has 144,000 followers</span> on Instagram, where he posts pictures of himself inside the parks alongside costumed employees, riding roller coasters, brandishing lightsabers and eating soft-serve.\n\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Mr. D\u2019Amaro said he\u2019s aware of the tension caused by rising prices and other changes, especially for annual passholders, but describes it as the inevitable result of progress, and insists that every change Disney has implemented at the parks is in service of improving visitors\u2019 trips.\n\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Other top Disney executives say the company is merely reacting to consumer behavior.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cDemand has not abated\u201d at the parks, Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy told analysts in a conference call in August, explaining why the company wasn\u2019t considering opening up the parks to more days for annual passholders.</span> The new reservation system has allowed the company to limit attendance without having to turn visitors away when the parks become overcrowded, as it occasionally did in previous years.\n\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">The company also points out that it offers frequent promotions, including discounted room rates at its hotels, packages that become more economical the more days a visitor spends at the park, and discounts for residents of Southern California and Florida.\n\n</span>Other theme-park operators are also reaping the benefits of increased guest spending. <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Six Flags Entertainment Corp. and Cedar Fair LP, which operates Cedar Point in Ohio and Knott\u2019s Berry Farm in California, have both raised prices, while SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. implemented <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 5% surcharge</span> on food and beverages.\n\n</span>Sara Suvada, a Starbucks shift supervisor and barista from Auburn Hills, Mich., took her first trip to Walt Disney World in January, at the age <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 42,</span> along with her husband and 6-year-old daughter. She said the trip was the fulfillment of a fantasy from her childhood, when money was tight in her family.\n\nThe family spent <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $5,000</span>\u2014most of it paid for by Ms. Suvada\u2019s in-laws\u2014on admission, meals and lodging at Disney\u2019s Saratoga Springs Resort. Ms. Suvada spent <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $400 on</span> souvenirs and concessions, while her husband told her he nearly maxed out his credit card on trinkets and snacks.\n\n<span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">The memories made up for the price tag, though, she said.</span> She cried when she saw Cinderella Castle for the first time. Her daughter loved riding the Space Mountain roller coaster and meeting her favorite princess, Tiana, from 2009\u2019s \u201cThe Princess and the Frog.\u201d And the family savored tasting their first Dole Whip frozen treat. Ms. Suvada is already thinking about returning with her mother.\n\n\u201cThe memories are worth more than gold,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if I did suffer from overdraft fees once I got home, when the reality set in.\u201d\n\nSome longtime fans who come to the park regularly, and aren\u2019t splurging on once-in-a-lifetime memories, complain about the new fees.\n\n\u201cI just really resent the nickel-and-diming,\u201d said David Arone, a 50-year-old gym teacher and volleyball coach from Redondo Beach, Calif. Mr. Arone has been a Disneyland annual pass holder for five years, and says he visits the park more <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100 times</span> a year, primarily because it reminds him of his best childhood friend, a Disney superfan who died of a heart attack <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in<span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2013.</span></span>\n\n\u201cI know it sounds hokey, but every time I go, I feel like he\u2019s there with me,\u201d Mr. Arone said of his friend. Most visits, he doesn\u2019t ride any attractions at all. Instead, he just walks around for a few hours, eats ice cream, watches fireworks and reminisces about visiting the park with his late friend.\n\nBut he chafes at recent changes. Previously, he could stop by Disneyland for a few hours after work any day he wanted. Now he can\u2019t go on the growing number of blackout days for annual passholders.\n\n<span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">On a recent visit, Mr. Arone sported a homemade T-shirt with the words \u201cChapek Killed The Magic\u201d on it \u2014 a reference to Mr. Chapek, the CEO, who he blames for rising prices and other changes.\n\n</span>The company said annual passholders like Mr. Arone \u201care amongst our most special guests.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">This month, the company reported that ticket-price increases were offset by an \u201cunfavorable attendance mix\u201d at Disneyland, which many fans interpreted as a reference to annual passholders who typically spend less per visit than individual ticket-buyers.</span> Fans recently started posting pictures of themselves at the parks on social media, wearing T-shirts reading \u201cUnfavorable\u201d in protest.\n\n<span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Disney said that \u201cunfavorable mix\u201d is financial parlance meant for investors, and \u201cnot a consumer term.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2021,</span> a Disneyland annual pass holder sued Disney, alleging that the company engaged in deceptive practices by artificially limiting how many of them could visit the park on certain days. In May, a U.S. District Court judge in California ruled that the suit could go forward. The plaintiff has said she is seeking class-action certification.\n\n<span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Even some customers who come on special annual visits say they are getting fed up with rising prices.\n\n</span>Renea Warren has made the pilgrimage to Walt Disney World nearly every year <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2001.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">But after tallying up the costs of this year\u2019s vacation, the retail executive and mother of one said she has had enough.\n\n</span>On a nine-day family trip to Florida in late July with her mother and daughter, Ms. Warren tried to save money by spending just two days at Disney theme parks, instead of the usual four. <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Despite the family\u2019s efforts, visits to Magic Kingdom and Epcot blew up their budget.</span> Park passes set them back more than $800; food was about $200; and they <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">dropped $300 on</span> souvenirs.\n\nSince Ms. Warren, who lives in Benton Harbor, Mich., owns a timeshare <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 20 minutes</span>\u2019 drive from Walt Disney World, her family will likely return to central Florida next year, but they\u2019ll consider rival attractions at Universal Studios Florida and SeaWorld, she said. Returning to Disney every year is no longer an option.\n\n\u201cBecause of the astronomical expenses, I definitely think the magic is being taken away,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Genie+ app feature replaced a system known as FastPass that used to come free with any ticket sold at Disneyland or Walt Disney World. The new service\u2014along with a free version, known simply as Genie\u2014does more than make Disney money: It also helps the parks\u2019 operators direct traffic and spread people around the parks more evenly, to reduce waiting times overall, and upsell visitors by offering them promotions on food, merchandise and ride-reservation fees.\n\nEach park has an operation center with a \u201cheat map\u201d that tracks where Genie+ users are in the parks using GPS technology. Park operators can direct traffic using the app by notifying visitors where the shortest lines are and offering food and merchandise promotions to cajole them to other areas.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m seeing too much activity on the west side, I\u2019m able to spread where I direct people to the east side,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Amaro said. \u201cOur attractions will be load-balanced better, and lines will be shorter, and what that means is the experience will be better.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">In an analysis for The Wall Street Journal, Touring Plans analyzed room prices, including taxes, at three popular Walt Disney World hotels over the past decade, and found increases that far outpaced inflation, which in July hit a record high <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 9.1%.</span>\n\n</span>At Pop Century, a \u201cvalue\u201d hotel at the Orlando resort, the cheapest room rate rose <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $168 this</span> year from $95 <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in<span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2013.</span></span> At the deluxe Animal Kingdom Lodge, a standard room now costs as much <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as $790 a</span> night, versus up <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $486 a</span> decade ago.\n\n<span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Prices for tickets and certain food items have also climbed faster than inflation over the past decade, the Touring Plans analysis found.</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Disney fan blogs have noted that classic purchases at Disney parks, including the pineapple Dole Whip frozen treat ($5.99 last year,<span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $6.99 this</span> year at some locations) and studded Mickey Mouse-ears headbands ($29.99 last summer, <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">now $39.99</span>) are quickly getting costlier, outpacing inflation.\n\n</span>In other cases, Disney has curtailed benefits. Guests staying at Disney-owned and certain other hotels at Walt Disney World before Covid could avail themselves of Extra Magic Hours, during which hotel guests could enter certain theme parks early or stay at them later into the night.\n\nToday, Disney offers early entry at all four of its Walt Disney World parks each day to hotel guests, but only <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 30 minutes</span>; before the pandemic, it offered an hour of early admission, but only every other day. Evening extended hours are now only available to visitors staying at the most-expensive \u201cdeluxe\u201d tier of hotels.\n\nDisney says some guests prefer the new arrangement.\n\nMariana Epperson, a 29-year-old mom from Kentucky who works as an account manager for a credit-ratings firm, spent part of her honeymoon at Disneyland, and Walt Disney World is the site of some of her final happy memories with her father, who died a few weeks after she took a trip there with her family in May.\n\n\u201cA lot of people will say, \u2018Oh, I can go to Europe for cheaper,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cBut Disney now holds the last really good memories of my dad, so for me it\u2019s so important. I can always make more money.\u201d\n\nEven so, this summer, her husband told her he needed a break from the theme parks. They\u2019ve visited Disney resorts six times <span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2017,</span> and the parks are getting way too expensive, she said. For their family vacation next year, they are thinking about a Disney cruise. Packages for three-night cruises from San Diego or Miami start at just <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over $1,000.</span> An ocean-view cabin costs more. So do between-meal snacks and excursions ashore.\n\nWrite to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com and Jacob Passy at jacob.passy@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\n\nAppeared in the August<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span><span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2022,</span> print edition as 'Disney\u2019s Magical New Pricing Formula'.", "displayed_text": "<h3>Disney\u2019s New Pricing Magic: More Profit From Fewer Park Visitors</h3>Aug.<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2022 12</span>:00 am ET\n\nWalt Disney used to call Disneyland his \u201cmagic kingdom.\u201d These days, Walt Disney Co.

2023,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n\nThe outcome is a bonanza for Disney: <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Even as the company limits the number of visitors and keeps attendance at its U.S. theme parks below prepandemic levels, they are generating record sales and profits.\n\n</span>The results reflect a major strategic shift on Disney\u2019s part, where the company is focused less on maximizing the quantity of visitors and more on increasing how much money each visitor spends, an approach the company refers to as yield management. Improving the visitor experience, the thinking goes, will prompt guests to spend more hours\u2014and therefore more money\u2014at the parks because they are having such a good time.\n\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">The biggest change in the past two years\u2014and the most lucrative for Disney\u2014is the introduction of a smartphone-app feature called Genie+ that <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">costs $15 per</span> person a day, on top of the price of admission, and allows parkgoers to skip the unreserved lines for some attractions, which the company refers to as \u201cstandby.\u201d</span> But Genie+ doesn\u2019t cover everything. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">To skip the standby lines at the most sought-after attractions, including some Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy-themed rides, reservations now cost an <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">additional $10 to</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $17.</span></span> Standby waits for popular attractions can last hours.\n\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">At the same time, many benefits that used to be free\u2014from parking for certain annual passholders to airport shuttles to MagicBand wristbands that serve as combination hotel-room keys and park passes\u2014have been eliminated or now come with a price.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Disney has raised prices on hotel rooms, food and merchandise over the past year as inflation has climbed to record levels in the U.S.\n\nDisney\u2019s theme-park pricing is determined by \u201cpure supply and demand,\u201d said a company spokeswoman.</span> \u201cNo different than airplanes, hotels or cruise ships.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">In the quarter that ended Jan.<span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 1,</span> Disney\u2019s domestic parks set records in both quarterly revenue and operating income, then broke both of them six months later.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">For the quarter that ended <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 2,</span> the business unit that includes the theme parks also posted record revenue <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $5.42 billion</span> and record operating income <span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of $1.65 billion</span>.\n\nJosh D\u2019Amaro, the chairman of Disney\u2019s parks, experiences and products division, said that the changes have given visitors more choice about how to spend their time and money at the parks, while at the same time making the parks \u201cextremely commercially successful.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">In <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">fiscal 2021,</span> the first year that both of Disney\u2019s two main U.S. resorts had reopened following the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, attendance at Disney\u2019s U.S. parks fell <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 17% compared</span> with the previous year, the company reported, but per-capita spending by guests grew <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 17%,</span> or nearly three times the average annual growth rate during the previous decade.</span> Disney doesn\u2019t disclose attendance for its theme parks.\n\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">At the same time, the changes driving the increases in revenue and profit have drawn the ire of what Disney calls \u201clegacy fans,\u201d or longtime parks loyalists, including annual passholders who feel they are being pushed to the side in favor of big-spending families taking once-a-year, or even a once-in-a-lifetime, vacations.\n\n</span>\u201cDisney has this love-hate relationship with annual passholders,\u201d said Len Testa, a computer scientist who runs Touring Plans, a travel company that offers apps to help visitors find deals and navigate their trips to Walt Disney World and publishes a popular guide to Disney theme parks.\n\n<span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">On one hand, they provide a reliable source of revenue\u2014the investment bank UBS estimated early last year that annual passholders at Disneyland account for about one half of annual visits\u2014but on the other, annual passholders tend to spend less than other visitors per visit, Mr. Testa said.\n\n</span>A typical annual pass holder might ride only one ride during a visit, eat an ice cream cone and walk around for a few hours, taking up capacity that might otherwise be used by out-of-state visitors, Mr. Testa said.\n\n\u201cThose people would have stayed all day,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would have eaten multiple times in the restaurants, they may have stayed in the hotel. They would definitely be buying more merchandise.\u201d\n\nSince its introduction in the fall <span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2021,</span> Genie+ has become an increasingly popular tool. About half of visitors to the parks pay for and use Genie+, Disney said in a recent conference call with Wall Street analysts. And of those who pay for Genie+,<span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 70% say</span> in post-visit surveys that they plan to do so again, Disney says.\n\nDisney has stopped selling nearly all new annual passes to Disneyland and Walt Disney World and has done away with a host of free perks that annual passholders used to enjoy. <span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Existing annual passholders can renew their passes, although earlier this month, the company raised the renewal price for its highest-tier annual passes to Disneyland <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 14%,</span> <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $1,599 from</span><span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $1,399,</span> while at the same time introducing more blackout days when passholders can\u2019t visit, angering some of the park\u2019s most ardent fans.\n\n</span>The parks have grown considerably since Walt Disney World opened <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1971.</span> Over the past decade, Disney has added rides based on popular franchises such as Star Wars, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Toy Story films and <span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2009 film</span> \u201cAvatar.\u201d A roller coaster at Magic Kingdom based on the Tron films is under construction.\n\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">The parks business has buoyed Disney\u2019s stock price and boosted financial results at a time when the company is losing billions on other businesses, like the popular but cost-heavy Disney+ streaming service.\n\n</span>Mr. D\u2019Amaro, the parks chief, is a 24-year veteran of the company who ran both Disneyland and Walt Disney World individually in previous roles.\n\n<span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">He keeps a high profile with fans and employees, making frequent appearances at the parks outside of major events and posting about his visits on social media.\n\n</span><span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">By contrast, his predecessor, Bob Chapek, who is now Disney\u2019s chief executive, walked the park grounds less frequently and wasn\u2019t as outgoing with visitors, according to Disney employees who worked under him.\n\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">On a recent, hourlong walk through Disneyland, Mr. D\u2019Amaro was stopped more <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 20 times</span> by visitors and cast members\u2014as Disney employees are known in company lingo\u2014who asked to take selfies with him and thanked him for his work.</span> <span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Mr. D\u2019Amaro <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">has 144,000 followers</span> on Instagram, where he posts pictures of himself inside the parks alongside costumed employees, riding roller coasters, brandishing lightsabers and eating soft-serve.\n\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Mr. D\u2019Amaro said he\u2019s aware of the tension caused by rising prices and other changes, especially for annual passholders, but describes it as the inevitable result of progress, and insists that every change Disney has implemented at the parks is in service of improving visitors\u2019 trips.\n\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">Other top Disney executives say the company is merely reacting to consumer behavior.</span> <span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">\u201cDemand has not abated\u201d at the parks, Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy told analysts in a conference call in August, explaining why the company wasn\u2019t considering opening up the parks to more days for annual passholders.</span> The new reservation system has allowed the company to limit attendance without having to turn visitors away when the parks become overcrowded, as it occasionally did in previous years.\n\n<span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">The company also points out that it offers frequent promotions, including discounted room rates at its hotels, packages that become more economical the more days a visitor spends at the park, and discounts for residents of Southern California and Florida.\n\n</span>Other theme-park operators are also reaping the benefits of increased guest spending. <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">Six Flags Entertainment Corp. and Cedar Fair LP, which operates Cedar Point in Ohio and Knott\u2019s Berry Farm in California, have both raised prices, while SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. implemented <span id=\"46\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a 5% surcharge</span> on food and beverages.\n\n</span>Sara Suvada, a Starbucks shift supervisor and barista from Auburn Hills, Mich., took her first trip to Walt Disney World in January, at the age <span id=\"47\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 42,</span> along with her husband and 6-year-old daughter. She said the trip was the fulfillment of a fantasy from her childhood, when money was tight in her family.\n\nThe family spent <span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $5,000</span>\u2014most of it paid for by Ms. Suvada\u2019s in-laws\u2014on admission, meals and lodging at Disney\u2019s Saratoga Springs Resort. Ms. Suvada spent <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around $400 on</span> souvenirs and concessions, while her husband told her he nearly maxed out his credit card on trinkets and snacks.\n\n<span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">The memories made up for the price tag, though, she said.</span> She cried when she saw Cinderella Castle for the first time. Her daughter loved riding the Space Mountain roller coaster and meeting her favorite princess, Tiana, from 2009\u2019s \u201cThe Princess and the Frog.\u201d And the family savored tasting their first Dole Whip frozen treat. Ms. Suvada is already thinking about returning with her mother.\n\n\u201cThe memories are worth more than gold,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if I did suffer from overdraft fees once I got home, when the reality set in.\u201d\n\nSome longtime fans who come to the park regularly, and aren\u2019t splurging on once-in-a-lifetime memories, complain about the new fees.\n\n\u201cI just really resent the nickel-and-diming,\u201d said David Arone, a 50-year-old gym teacher and volleyball coach from Redondo Beach, Calif. Mr. Arone has been a Disneyland annual pass holder for five years, and says he visits the park more <span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 100 times</span> a year, primarily because it reminds him of his best childhood friend, a Disney superfan who died of a heart attack <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in<span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2013.</span></span>\n\n\u201cI know it sounds hokey, but every time I go, I feel like he\u2019s there with me,\u201d Mr. Arone said of his friend. Most visits, he doesn\u2019t ride any attractions at all. Instead, he just walks around for a few hours, eats ice cream, watches fireworks and reminisces about visiting the park with his late friend.\n\nBut he chafes at recent changes. Previously, he could stop by Disneyland for a few hours after work any day he wanted. Now he can\u2019t go on the growing number of blackout days for annual passholders.\n\n<span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">On a recent visit, Mr. Arone sported a homemade T-shirt with the words \u201cChapek Killed The Magic\u201d on it \u2014 a reference to Mr. Chapek, the CEO, who he blames for rising prices and other changes.\n\n</span>The company said annual passholders like Mr. Arone \u201care amongst our most special guests.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">This month, the company reported that ticket-price increases were offset by an \u201cunfavorable attendance mix\u201d at Disneyland, which many fans interpreted as a reference to annual passholders who typically spend less per visit than individual ticket-buyers.</span> Fans recently started posting pictures of themselves at the parks on social media, wearing T-shirts reading \u201cUnfavorable\u201d in protest.\n\n<span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Disney said that \u201cunfavorable mix\u201d is financial parlance meant for investors, and \u201cnot a consumer term.\u201d\n\n</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2021,</span> a Disneyland annual pass holder sued Disney, alleging that the company engaged in deceptive practices by artificially limiting how many of them could visit the park on certain days. In May, a U.S. District Court judge in California ruled that the suit could go forward. The plaintiff has said she is seeking class-action certification.\n\n<span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Even some customers who come on special annual visits say they are getting fed up with rising prices.\n\n</span>Renea Warren has made the pilgrimage to Walt Disney World nearly every year <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2001.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">But after tallying up the costs of this year\u2019s vacation, the retail executive and mother of one said she has had enough.\n\n</span>On a nine-day family trip to Florida in late July with her mother and daughter, Ms. Warren tried to save money by spending just two days at Disney theme parks, instead of the usual four. <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Despite the family\u2019s efforts, visits to Magic Kingdom and Epcot blew up their budget.</span> Park passes set them back more than $800; food was about $200; and they <span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">dropped $300 on</span> souvenirs.\n\nSince Ms. Warren, who lives in Benton Harbor, Mich., owns a timeshare <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 20 minutes</span>\u2019 drive from Walt Disney World, her family will likely return to central Florida next year, but they\u2019ll consider rival attractions at Universal Studios Florida and SeaWorld, she said. Returning to Disney every year is no longer an option.\n\n\u201cBecause of the astronomical expenses, I definitely think the magic is being taken away,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Genie+ app feature replaced a system known as FastPass that used to come free with any ticket sold at Disneyland or Walt Disney World. The new service\u2014along with a free version, known simply as Genie\u2014does more than make Disney money: It also helps the parks\u2019 operators direct traffic and spread people around the parks more evenly, to reduce waiting times overall, and upsell visitors by offering them promotions on food, merchandise and ride-reservation fees.\n\nEach park has an operation center with a \u201cheat map\u201d that tracks where Genie+ users are in the parks using GPS technology. Park operators can direct traffic using the app by notifying visitors where the shortest lines are and offering food and merchandise promotions to cajole them to other areas.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m seeing too much activity on the west side, I\u2019m able to spread where I direct people to the east side,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Amaro said. \u201cOur attractions will be load-balanced better, and lines will be shorter, and what that means is the experience will be better.\u201d\n\n<span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">In an analysis for The Wall Street Journal, Touring Plans analyzed room prices, including taxes, at three popular Walt Disney World hotels over the past decade, and found increases that far outpaced inflation, which in July hit a record high <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 9.1%.</span>\n\n</span>At Pop Century, a \u201cvalue\u201d hotel at the Orlando resort, the cheapest room rate rose <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $168 this</span> year from $95 <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in<span id=\"59\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2013.</span></span> At the deluxe Animal Kingdom Lodge, a standard room now costs as much <span id=\"60\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">as $790 a</span> night, versus up <span id=\"61\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $486 a</span> decade ago.\n\n<span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Prices for tickets and certain food items have also climbed faster than inflation over the past decade, the Touring Plans analysis found.</span> <span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Disney fan blogs have noted that classic purchases at Disney parks, including the pineapple Dole Whip frozen treat ($5.99 last year,<span id=\"62\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> $6.99 this</span> year at some locations) and studded Mickey Mouse-ears headbands ($29.99 last summer, <span id=\"63\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">now $39.99</span>) are quickly getting costlier, outpacing inflation.\n\n</span>In other cases, Disney has curtailed benefits. Guests staying at Disney-owned and certain other hotels at Walt Disney World before Covid could avail themselves of Extra Magic Hours, during which hotel guests could enter certain theme parks early or stay at them later into the night.\n\nToday, Disney offers early entry at all four of its Walt Disney World parks each day to hotel guests, but only <span id=\"64\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 30 minutes</span>; before the pandemic, it offered an hour of early admission, but only every other day. Evening extended hours are now only available to visitors staying at the most-expensive \u201cdeluxe\u201d tier of hotels.\n\nDisney says some guests prefer the new arrangement.\n\nMariana Epperson, a 29-year-old mom from Kentucky who works as an account manager for a credit-ratings firm, spent part of her honeymoon at Disneyland, and Walt Disney World is the site of some of her final happy memories with her father, who died a few weeks after she took a trip there with her family in May.\n\n\u201cA lot of people will say, \u2018Oh, I can go to Europe for cheaper,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cBut Disney now holds the last really good memories of my dad, so for me it\u2019s so important. I can always make more money.\u201d\n\nEven so, this summer, her husband told her he needed a break from the theme parks. They\u2019ve visited Disney resorts six times <span id=\"65\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2017,</span> and the parks are getting way too expensive, she said. For their family vacation next year, they are thinking about a Disney cruise. Packages for three-night cruises from San Diego or Miami start at just <span id=\"66\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over $1,000.</span> An ocean-view cabin costs more. So do between-meal snacks and excursions ashore.\n\nWrite to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com and Jacob Passy at jacob.passy@wsj.com\n\n87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\n\nAppeared in the August<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 27,</span><span id=\"68\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2022,</span> print edition as 'Disney\u2019s Magical New Pricing Formula'."}, "305": {"id": "305", "text": "<h3>Perspective | If Trump Runs Again, Do Not Cover Him the Same Way: A Journalist\u2019s Manifesto</h3>If Trump Runs Again, Do Not Cover Him the Same Way: A Journalist\u2019s Manifesto\nI believed in traditional reporting, but Trump changed me \u2014 and it should change the rest of the media too.\nPerspective by Margaret Sullivan\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">October 12,</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2022 at</span> 10:00 a.m. EDT\nDespite my nearly four decades in journalism, I was unprepared for the moment of no return that came on a July day <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span></span></span> as a blazing sun beat down on the streets of Cleveland. Walking around the grounds of the Republican National Convention, I was looking for a column idea. I was new at this, having started at The Washington Post only a few weeks earlier. Wandering and observing, I came upon a table of souvenirs, meant to appeal to the convention attendees who had arrived from all corners of the nation to cheer on the Republican Party\u2019s nomination of Donald Trump. I already had seen some gleefully misogynistic anti-Clinton paraphernalia \u2014 \u201cHillary sucks but not like Monica\u201d \u2014 but nothing measured up to the horror I felt as I registered the meaning of a T-shirt featuring the image of a noose and these words: \u201cRope. Tree. Journalist. Some assembly required.\u201d\nOver the weeks and months ahead, as I started to write what I hoped were well-reasoned Post columns about Trump\u2019s relationship with the media, I felt an irrational anger coming at me like an unending blast from an industrial-strength hose. Trump hadn\u2019t invented this anger, of course, but he certainly emboldened it \u2014 and used it for his own purposes. On social media, in phone messages, in emails I received, the sheer hatred from Trump supporters shocked and even frightened me. One, unsigned but from a \u201clifetime member of the NRA,\u201d asserted that people like me wouldn\u2019t be around much longer. Another, signed \u201cA Real, True Patriot,\u201d read:\n\u201cThough I would never read a manure-laden pile of toilet paper like Washington Compost, I heard about your Nazi column about \u2018reaching the masses\u2019 with your fake news to convince people that your leftist Nazi lies are truth. You are a well-trained serpent of the left, following communist orders as you were taught. \u2018If you say and repeat a lie often enough, it will eventually be seen as truth\u2019 \u2014 Lenin \u2026 Here\u2019s what you (slithering, fake-news/propaganda- generating slimy slug) should do: Go fornicate yourself with a large, sharp knife, and then eat rat poison until your belly is stuffed.\u201d\nI was called the c-word repeatedly. One reader suggested I have my breasts cut off. I tried to let all this nastiness roll off my back and even found it amusing when a Post reader sent me an email calling me a \u201cvenomous serpent.\u201d John Schwartz, then a reporter for the New York Times who had become a friend, suggested I treat it as a badge of honor and write a book titled \u201cMemories of a Venomous Serpent.\u201d\nNow, six years later, we journalists know a lot more about covering Trump and his supporters. We\u2019ve come a long way, but certainly made plenty of mistakes. Too many times, we acted as his stenographers or megaphones. Too often, we failed to refer to his many falsehoods as lies. It took too long to stop believing that, whenever he calmed down for a moment, he was becoming \u201cpresidential.\u201d And it took too long to moderate our instinct to give equal weight to both sides, even when one side was using misinformation for political gain.\nIt\u2019s been an education for all of us \u2014 a gradual realization that the instincts and conventions of traditional journalism weren\u2019t good enough for this moment in our country\u2019s history. As Trump prepares to run again <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2024,</span> it\u2019s worth reminding ourselves of the lessons we\u2019ve learned \u2014 and committing to the principle that, when covering politicians who are essentially running against democracy, old-style journalism will no longer suffice.\nBack <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span></span></span> I was still looking for common ground with the Trump crowd. It fit with my background as a traditional newspaper journalist. During <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 13 years</span> as chief editor of the Buffalo News, ending <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2012,</span> I had believed that I could listen to or communicate with our readers, whatever their politics \u2014 and I was registered to vote as a \u201cblank.\u201d Our editorial board, which I sat on, endorsed candidates from various parties, and I had courteous relationships with officeholders of all stripes. I frequently would go out to speak to civic organizations, such as rotary clubs, in the Buffalo-Niagara region with no regard for whether their members leaned right or left.\nAt the Cleveland airport after the convention, I interviewed one delegate, a concierge for a car dealership named Mary Sue McCarty, who wore a cowboy hat and pearls as she waited for her flight home to Dallas. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">She had her mind made up about the news media: \u201cJournalists aren\u2019t doing their jobs.</span> They are protecting a certain class.\u201d <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">When I pointed out that it was the New York Times that broke the consequential story about Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices and that mainstream media organizations had aggressively investigated the finances of the Clinton Foundation, she shrugged: \u201cIf it\u2019s a Republican, it\u2019s investigated to death.</span> If it\u2019s a Democrat, it\u2019s breezed over.\u201d\nThis assertion could hardly have been more wrong. After all, the media\u2019s endless emphasis on Clinton\u2019s emails would prove to be a big factor in dooming her campaign. It simply wasn\u2019t the case that the press was giving Democrats a pass.\nClearly, the empirical common ground I depended upon \u2014 and believed in \u2014 was eroding. Dealing with that growing reality over the next few years would change me as a journalist and even as a person. Some principles and beliefs, I found, were more important than appearing to get along with everyone or responding to criticism by offering to compromise or change course. Journalists have to stand, unwaveringly, for the truth \u2014 and if that meant being attacked by zealots who wanted to call such a position evidence of bias, I could live with that. For me, it would soon become a matter of simple integrity to acknowledge that some of the old-school rules and practices didn\u2019t work anymore.\nAdvertisement\nFrom this new vantage point, it seemed self-evident that the mainstream press was too often going easy on Trump. Well into his presidency, journalists didn\u2019t want to use the word \u201clie\u201d for Trump\u2019s constant barrage of falsehoods. To lie, editors reasoned, means to intend to be untruthful. Since journalists couldn\u2019t be inside politicians\u2019 heads, how were we supposed to know if \u2014 by this definition \u2014 they were really lying? The logic eventually became strained, given that Trump blithely repeated the same rank mistruths over and over.\nToo many reporters and their editors didn\u2019t seem to want to figure out how to cover Trump properly. From the moment he descended the golden escalator at Manhattan\u2019s Trump Tower in <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2015 to</span> announce his candidacy, the news media was in his thrall. Journalists couldn\u2019t stop writing about him, showing him on TV and even broadcasting images of the empty stage waiting for him to arrive at a rally. Trump had described himself as \u201cthe ratings machine,\u201d and for once he wasn\u2019t exaggerating.\nAs I continued to tackle <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2016 campaign</span>, I criticized the press\u2019s obsession with the former reality-TV star, yet I was caught up in it, too. I have no regrets about what I wrote, but I certainly was aware that if I wrote a column with Trump\u2019s name in the headline, it probably would find a passionate audience: thousands of comments and retweets, hundreds of emails, requests to talk on TV. And because I wrote about the news media, and Trump never stopped using the news media as a foil, there was so much to say.\nIn every way, Trump was a deeply abnormal candidate, but the news media couldn\u2019t seem to communicate that effectively or even grasp the problem. Instead, his every unhinged, middle-of-the-night tweet was covered like legitimate news. To be fair, the media was applying a standard that had made sense up until that moment: When a major presidential candidate says something provocative or worse, it\u2019s newsworthy. The problem is that we were applying this old standard to a candidate who was exploiting it for his own purposes \u2014 while seeking to undermine democracy itself.\nAdvertisement\nIn the late afternoon of Nov.<span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 8,</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span> Election Day, I walked into The Post\u2019s newsroom with a column already started about Hillary Clinton\u2019s supposedly inevitable victory. A few hours later, I was scrambling, just like every reporter, editor and commentator. My colleagues and I watched the television screens placed all around the newsroom as one battleground state after another fell to Trump.\nTossing away my useless column, I wrote that the media coverage of <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2016 race</span> had been, as I put it, \u201can epic fail.\u201d <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">They \u2014 and I would include myself in this criticism \u2014 employed a kind of magical thinking: A Trump presidency shouldn\u2019t happen, therefore it won\u2019t happen.\n</span>Soon, word filtered down from the boss, Marty Baron, that I should produce a second column before I left the newsroom that night. He wanted me to write my recommendations for how the traditional press should cover the new president. So, I wrote a call to arms for American journalists: \u201cJournalists are going to have to be better \u2014 stronger, more courageous, stiffer-spined \u2014 than they\u2019ve ever been.\u201d I filed it, not at all convinced that I\u2019d written anything worthwhile on this momentous night, said good night to my editor and headed out of the newsroom <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">around 3 a</span>.m.\nStunned and spent, I walked slowly through the deserted streets of downtown Washington. As I neared my apartment, I could see the U.S. Capitol, that seemingly inviolable symbol of American democracy, off to the east. Lit from within, it glowed an ethereal white in the darkness.\nIn every way, Trump was a deeply abnormal candidate, but the news media couldn\u2019t seem to communicate that effectively or even grasp the problem.\nAs we would learn over the coming years, the Capitol was not inviolable, and neither is the democracy it represents. American democracy is now on the edge of a precipice. What can members of the press do to help keep it from tipping over as <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2024 campaign</span> looms? What should we have learned since that summer in 2016?\nFor one thing, I\u2019m convinced that journalists \u2014 specifically those who cover politics \u2014 must keep a sharp focus on truth-seeking, not old-style performative neutrality. Does that mean we throw objectivity out the window? Of course not. We should be resolutely objective in the sense of seeking evidence and approaching subjects with an open mind. We should not, however, resort to taking everything down the middle, no matter what. Rather than, for example, having equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats (or conservatives and progressives) on every talk show, or devoting equal numbers of words to each side of a political argument, we should be thinking about what coverage serves the public best.\nThose who deny the outcome of <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2020 election</span></span> certainly don\u2019t deserve a media megaphone for that enduring lie, one that is likely to reemerge in the presidential campaign ahead. But the media should go one step further: When covering such a politician in other contexts \u2014 for example, about abortion rights or gun control \u2014 journalists should remind audiences that this public figure is an election denier.\nThat\u2019s exactly the model pursued by WITF, a public radio station in Harrisburg, Pa., which decided to remind its audience on a regular basis that some Republican state legislators and members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation had opposed the transfer of power to Joe Biden, despite the lack of evidence to support their claims of election fraud. A story on the station\u2019s website about a state legislator\u2019s efforts to get Pennsylvanians vaccinated was accompanied by a sidebar of text about his behavior after the election. On-air stories have used a tagline to accomplish the same purpose. The decision wasn\u2019t easy, one editor told me, \u201cbecause this is not the normal thing.\u201d\n<span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">Advertisement\nUnfortunately, many media organizations \u2014 increasingly owned these days by huge corporations or hedge funds \u2014 seem more interested in ratings and profits than in serving the public interest.</span> So, they are extremely hesitant to offend groups of viewers or voters, including the many Republicans who have signed on to the lie about <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2020 election</span></span> being stolen. The new boss of CNN, Chris Licht, raised eyebrows when he made the rounds on Capitol Hill a few months ago to assure Republican leaders that members of their party would be treated fairly on the network that had been one of the former president\u2019s favorite punching bags. One conservative publication, the Washington Free Beacon, called Licht\u2019s unusual outreach an \u201capology tour.\u201d Given all this, it\u2019s difficult to picture CNN consistently alerting viewers that a politician is an election denier, even when discussing a different subject. Yet that\u2019s exactly the type of bold measure that is needed.\nMedia people \u2014 not just reporters but their editors and top leaders of newsrooms \u2014 also need to take a hard, critical look at the types of stories that constitute traditional campaign coverage. That coverage has historically leaned on such things as live footage of speeches, rallies and debates; on \u201chorse race\u201d articles based on polls or conventional wisdom; and on blowing up small conflicts (campaign staff in disarray!) into major stories. These modes of coverage can have the effect of normalizing a candidate who should not be normalized. They also often constitute a distraction at a time when huge swaths of one party are essentially running against democratic practices.\nBy no means am I counseling that journalists act as if they are \u201con the team\u201d of Trump\u2019s rivals. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s not our job.</span> At the same time, we have to be aware that covering someone who doesn\u2019t care about democratic norms \u2014 even something as basic as the peaceful transfer of power \u2014 requires different judgments about what stories really matter, and how we should or should not cover them.\nIn making these judgments, we have to relentlessly explain ourselves to our readers, viewers and listeners. Although it didn\u2019t involve Trump, a good example of this came over the summer when the Plain Dealer newspaper in Cleveland decided against covering a rally for U.S. Senate candidate J.D. Vance featuring Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis because of the absurdly restrictive rules the campaign had tried to impose, including a prohibition against interviewing attendees who weren\u2019t approved by rally organizers. Instead, the Plain Dealer published white space, with a note to readers written by editor Chris Quinn headlined, \u201cWe reject the free speech-trampling rules set by J.D. Vance and Ron DeSantis for covering their rally.\u201d Quinn was blunt: \u201cThink about what they were doing here. They were staging an event to rally people to vote for Vance while instituting the kinds of policies you\u2019d see in a fascist regime.\u201d\nOf course, the press must be just as tough on Democrats, should they adopt similar tactics or start lying all the time or trashing governmental norms. The standards should be the same for all. But journalists shouldn\u2019t shy away from the unavoidable truth: Most of this is coming from Trump-style Republicans.\nPerhaps the most important thing journalists can do as they cover the campaign ahead is to provide thoughtful framing and context. They shouldn\u2019t just repeat what\u2019s being said, but help explain what it means. This is especially important in headlines and news alerts, which are about as far as many news consumers get. When Trump rants about the supposed horrors of rigged elections and voting fraud, journalists have to constantly provide the counterweight of truth. We have gotten better at this <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2016.</span> Now we have to stick to it.\nAll of these suggestions go against the grain of traditional politics coverage. Undoubtedly, this approach will draw accusations of bias from the right; undoubtedly, journalists and news leaders will be put on the defensive. They\u2019ll need to get over that. The stakes are enormously high. Doing things the same old way isn\u2019t remotely appropriate. By now, that\u2019s something we all should have learned.\nMargaret Sullivan was The Post\u2019s media columnist <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2016 until</span> late August.

Walking around the grounds of the Republican National Convention, I was looking for a column idea. I was new at this, having started at The Washington Post only a few weeks earlier. Wandering and observing, I came upon a table of souvenirs, meant to appeal to the convention attendees who had arrived from all corners of the nation to cheer on the Republican Party\u2019s nomination of Donald Trump. I already had seen some gleefully misogynistic anti-Clinton paraphernalia \u2014 \u201cHillary sucks but not like Monica\u201d \u2014 but nothing measured up to the horror I felt as I registered the meaning of a T-shirt featuring the image of a noose and these words: \u201cRope. Tree. Journalist. Some assembly required.\u201d\nOver the weeks and months ahead, as I started to write what I hoped were well-reasoned Post columns about Trump\u2019s relationship with the media, I felt an irrational anger coming at me like an unending blast from an industrial-strength hose. Trump hadn\u2019t invented this anger, of course, but he certainly emboldened it \u2014 and used it for his own purposes. On social media, in phone messages, in emails I received, the sheer hatred from Trump supporters shocked and even frightened me. One, unsigned but from a \u201clifetime member of the NRA,\u201d asserted that people like me wouldn\u2019t be around much longer. Another, signed \u201cA Real, True Patriot,\u201d read:\n\u201cThough I would never read a manure-laden pile of toilet paper like Washington Compost, I heard about your Nazi column about \u2018reaching the masses\u2019 with your fake news to convince people that your leftist Nazi lies are truth. You are a well-trained serpent of the left, following communist orders as you were taught. \u2018If you say and repeat a lie often enough, it will eventually be seen as truth\u2019 \u2014 Lenin \u2026 Here\u2019s what you (slithering, fake-news/propaganda- generating slimy slug) should do: Go fornicate yourself with a large, sharp knife, and then eat rat poison until your belly is stuffed.\u201d\nI was called the c-word repeatedly. One reader suggested I have my breasts cut off. I tried to let all this nastiness roll off my back and even found it amusing when a Post reader sent me an email calling me a \u201cvenomous serpent.\u201d John Schwartz, then a reporter for the New York Times who had become a friend, suggested I treat it as a badge of honor and write a book titled \u201cMemories of a Venomous Serpent.\u201d\nNow, six years later, we journalists know a lot more about covering Trump and his supporters. We\u2019ve come a long way, but certainly made plenty of mistakes. Too many times, we acted as his stenographers or megaphones. Too often, we failed to refer to his many falsehoods as lies. It took too long to stop believing that, whenever he calmed down for a moment, he was becoming \u201cpresidential.\u201d And it took too long to moderate our instinct to give equal weight to both sides, even when one side was using misinformation for political gain.\nIt\u2019s been an education for all of us \u2014 a gradual realization that the instincts and conventions of traditional journalism weren\u2019t good enough for this moment in our country\u2019s history. As Trump prepares to run again <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2024,</span> it\u2019s worth reminding ourselves of the lessons we\u2019ve learned \u2014 and committing to the principle that, when covering politicians who are essentially running against democracy, old-style journalism will no longer suffice.\nBack <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in<span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2016,</span></span></span> I was still looking for common ground with the Trump crowd.

What should we have learned since that summer in 2016?\nFor one thing, I\u2019m convinced that journalists \u2014 specifically those who cover politics \u2014 must keep a sharp focus on truth-seeking, not old-style performative neutrality. Does that mean we throw objectivity out the window? Of course not. We should be resolutely objective in the sense of seeking evidence and approaching subjects with an open mind. We should not, however, resort to taking everything down the middle, no matter what. Rather than, for example, having equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats (or conservatives and progressives) on every talk show, or devoting equal numbers of words to each side of a political argument, we should be thinking about what coverage serves the public best.\nThose who deny the outcome of <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2020 election</span></span> certainly don\u2019t deserve a media megaphone for that enduring lie, one that is likely to reemerge in the presidential campaign ahead.

The new boss of CNN, Chris Licht, raised eyebrows when he made the rounds on Capitol Hill a few months ago to assure Republican leaders that members of their party would be treated fairly on the network that had been one of the former president\u2019s favorite punching bags. One conservative publication, the Washington Free Beacon, called Licht\u2019s unusual outreach an \u201capology tour.\u201d Given all this, it\u2019s difficult to picture CNN consistently alerting viewers that a politician is an election denier, even when discussing a different subject. Yet that\u2019s exactly the type of bold measure that is needed.\nMedia people \u2014 not just reporters but their editors and top leaders of newsrooms \u2014 also need to take a hard, critical look at the types of stories that constitute traditional campaign coverage. That coverage has historically leaned on such things as live footage of speeches, rallies and debates; on \u201chorse race\u201d articles based on polls or conventional wisdom; and on blowing up small conflicts (campaign staff in disarray!) into major stories. These modes of coverage can have the effect of normalizing a candidate who should not be normalized. They also often constitute a distraction at a time when huge swaths of one party are essentially running against democratic practices.\nBy no means am I counseling that journalists act as if they are \u201con the team\u201d of Trump\u2019s rivals. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s not our job.</span> At the same time, we have to be aware that covering someone who doesn\u2019t care about democratic norms \u2014 even something as basic as the peaceful transfer of power \u2014 requires different judgments about what stories really matter, and how we should or should not cover them.\nIn making these judgments, we have to relentlessly explain ourselves to our readers, viewers and listeners. Although it didn\u2019t involve Trump, a good example of this came over the summer when the Plain Dealer newspaper in Cleveland decided against covering a rally for U.S. Senate candidate J.D. Vance featuring Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis because of the absurdly restrictive rules the campaign had tried to impose, including a prohibition against interviewing attendees who weren\u2019t approved by rally organizers. Instead, the Plain Dealer published white space, with a note to readers written by editor Chris Quinn headlined, \u201cWe reject the free speech-trampling rules set by J.D. Vance and Ron DeSantis for covering their rally.\u201d Quinn was blunt: \u201cThink about what they were doing here. They were staging an event to rally people to vote for Vance while instituting the kinds of policies you\u2019d see in a fascist regime.\u201d\nOf course, the press must be just as tough on Democrats, should they adopt similar tactics or start lying all the time or trashing governmental norms. The standards should be the same for all. But journalists shouldn\u2019t shy away from the unavoidable truth: Most of this is coming from Trump-style Republicans.\nPerhaps the most important thing journalists can do as they cover the campaign ahead is to provide thoughtful framing and context. They shouldn\u2019t just repeat what\u2019s being said, but help explain what it means. This is especially important in headlines and news alerts, which are about as far as many news consumers get. When Trump rants about the supposed horrors of rigged elections and voting fraud, journalists have to constantly provide the counterweight of truth. We have gotten better at this <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2016.</span> Now we have to stick to it.\nAll of these suggestions go against the grain of traditional politics coverage. Undoubtedly, this approach will draw accusations of bias from the right; undoubtedly, journalists and news leaders will be put on the defensive. They\u2019ll need to get over that. The stakes are enormously high. Doing things the same old way isn\u2019t remotely appropriate. By now, that\u2019s something we all should have learned.\nMargaret Sullivan was The Post\u2019s media columnist <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2016 until</span> late August.

Initially, Origo was not a topic of discussion.\nBut that changed in the early summer at a secret meeting in Vienna between Mr. Lazar and two senior company executives, according to three people with knowledge of the discussion. Mr. Lazar said that Origo\u2019s journalists had historically struggled to grasp the government\u2019s perspective on certain matters and proposed a remedy: a secret line of communication between Origo\u2019s editors and the highest levels of government.\nMr. Lazar was careful not to frame the request as a quid pro quo for new licenses, or as a form of censorship. But the Magyar Telekom executives took it seriously.\nBy autumn, Origo had signed a contract with a media consultancy run by Attila Varhegyi, the former director of Mr. Orban\u2019s party. As a consultant, Mr. Varhegyi had played a major role in turning Hungarian state media into a mouthpiece for Mr. Orban and now his attention had pivoted to the private sector.\nUnder the deal, Mr. Varhegyi\u2019s firm could call Origo\u2019s editor with suggestions about coverage.\nThat same month, the government extended its license agreements with the country\u2019s three mobile telephone operators.\nMagyar Telekom was awarded the biggest share.\nBoth Magyar Telekom and its parent company declined to comment on the Vienna meeting and Mr. Varhegyi. But in a general statement, Magyar Telekom said: \u201cDialogue between the government in office and the management of Magyar Telekom is a matter of fact, but its aim has never been to limit publicity or the freedom of press.\u201d\nMr. Varhegyi and Mr. Lazar turned down several interview requests and ignored requests for comment.\nAn Editor Fired\nOutraged, Origo\u2019s editor in chief resigned, refusing to participate in the deal. But his replacement, Gergo Saling, appeared undaunted.\nBy <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">January 2014,</span> Mr. Saling\u2019s team had even launched an investigation into Mr. Lazar\u2019s foreign travel expenses. Requests by Mr. Varhegyi\u2019s firm to slow the project down were ignored.\nBut Mr. Saling was living on borrowed time.\nThe investigation was embarrassing to Magyar Telekom: Mr. Lazar had overseen the company\u2019s license renewal and discussions were still underway over the contract to install broadband in the countryside.\nMr. Lazar complained about the story in a meeting with two Magyar Telekom executives in <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">February 2014,</span> according to two people with knowledge of the discussion, and his disapproval was quickly relayed to Origo\u2019s management. It was one of several attempts by Magyar Telekom management, and Mr. Varhegyi\u2019s firm, to sway the investigation, both before and after the broadband deal was announced later that month, according to four people familiar with the controversy.\nUndeterred, Mr. Saling\u2019s journalists continued to scrutinize Mr. Lazar\u2019s travel. They eventually began court proceedings to request specific travel records, and published several embarrassing stories about the minister\u2019s movements.\nBut by the start of summer, Mr. Saling\u2019s superiors had run out of patience. Mr. Orban had won re-election in April. Mr. Saling was fired in early June, nominally by mutual agreement.\nThe decision was ultimately made by Miklos Vaszily, Origo\u2019s chief executive. But it came only after months of pressure on Mr. Vaszily from Magyar Telekom\u2019s management and Mr. Varhegyi\u2019s firm, according to three people at the company.\nIn protest, several of Origo\u2019s best reporters resigned.\nFor Magyar Telekom, Origo had become a public relations liability and a political hindrance, and executives wanted to sell.\nFlush With Government Cash\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Throughout 2014,</span> Magyar Telekom held talks with prospective buyers but decided against a private sale. The Lazar scandal had caused a public outcry, as critics accused the company of bending to political pressure. Executives wanted the deal to be beyond reproach, so an open bidding process was announced in <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2015 and</span> overseen by Ernst and Young, an international accountancy firm.\nThe winner was named in November 2015: a firm called New Wave Media, which outbid two rival companies.\nNew Wave\u2019s profile immediately raised eyebrows. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Their bid was financed by funds controlled by two banks, one owned by Mr. Orban\u2019s government, and another owned by Tamas Szemerey, a cousin of one of Mr. Orban\u2019s former ministers.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">In addition, New Wave was part-owned by Mr. Szemerey\u2019s longtime business partner, company records show.\n</span>Mr. Szemerey had made earlier attempts to buy Origo directly. But by his own telling, Magyar Telekom executives had discouraged such a direct attempt, on the grounds that he would be perceived as too close to the government.\nYet Mr. Szemerey ended up helping to pay for Origo all the same.\nThere was no evidence of favoritism: New Wave had simply made the highest bid. But bolstered by money from the state, New Wave could afford to pay whatever it took to avoid the outlet being sold to businesses not aligned with the government.\n\u201cWe did not want it in the hands of Soros, or in the hands of people outside Hungary, or people who wanted to influence Hungarian politics against the Hungarian government,\u201d Mr. Szemerey said in an interview.\nMagyar Telekom and Deutsche Telekom declined to comment on Mr. Szemerey\u2019s contacts with Telekom officials, but said the deal had been conducted transparently.\nThough nominally still private, Origo now became a vessel for the government. Bought in part with government money, Origo now published news that echoed the government\u2019s stance \u2014 in particular on migration, Mr. Soros, and the European Union, whose officials have frequently criticized Mr. Orban.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Before, Origo had struggled financially.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Now it was flush with government advertising revenue, which more than tripled following the sale.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2017,</span></span> the son of Mr. Orban\u2019s former finance minister became New Wave\u2019s CEO and government advertising revenues kept rising, even as Origo\u2019s coverage became even more aggressively pro-Orban.\n</span>At the time, <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2015 sale</span> of Origo could have been considered an outlier. Then, Origo became one of <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 31 outlets</span> owned by Mr. Orban\u2019s allies, according to research by Atlatszo, an investigative news website.\nToday, there are more <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 500.</span>", "displayed_text": "<h3>The Website That Shows How a Free Press Can Die</h3>BUDAPEST \u2014 Hungary\u2019s leading news website, Origo, had a juicy scoop: A top aide to the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, had used state money to pay for sizable but unexplained expenses during secret foreign trips.

The Lazar scandal had caused a public outcry, as critics accused the company of bending to political pressure. Executives wanted the deal to be beyond reproach, so an open bidding process was announced in <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 2015 and</span> overseen by Ernst and Young, an international accountancy firm.\nThe winner was named in November 2015: a firm called New Wave Media, which outbid two rival companies.\nNew Wave\u2019s profile immediately raised eyebrows. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">Their bid was financed by funds controlled by two banks, one owned by Mr. Orban\u2019s government, and another owned by Tamas Szemerey, a cousin of one of Mr. Orban\u2019s former ministers.</span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">In addition, New Wave was part-owned by Mr. Szemerey\u2019s longtime business partner, company records show.\n</span>Mr. Szemerey had made earlier attempts to buy Origo directly. But by his own telling, Magyar Telekom executives had discouraged such a direct attempt, on the grounds that he would be perceived as too close to the government.\nYet Mr. Szemerey ended up helping to pay for Origo all the same.\nThere was no evidence of favoritism: New Wave had simply made the highest bid. But bolstered by money from the state, New Wave could afford to pay whatever it took to avoid the outlet being sold to businesses not aligned with the government.\n\u201cWe did not want it in the hands of Soros, or in the hands of people outside Hungary, or people who wanted to influence Hungarian politics against the Hungarian government,\u201d Mr. Szemerey said in an interview.\nMagyar Telekom and Deutsche Telekom declined to comment on Mr. Szemerey\u2019s contacts with Telekom officials, but said the deal had been conducted transparently.\nThough nominally still private, Origo now became a vessel for the government. Bought in part with government money, Origo now published news that echoed the government\u2019s stance \u2014 in particular on migration, Mr. Soros, and the European Union, whose officials have frequently criticized Mr. Orban.\n<span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Before, Origo had struggled financially.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Now it was flush with government advertising revenue, which more than tripled following the sale.</span> <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 2017,</span></span> the son of Mr. Orban\u2019s former finance minister became New Wave\u2019s CEO and government advertising revenues kept rising, even as Origo\u2019s coverage became even more aggressively pro-Orban.\n</span>At the time, <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2015 sale</span> of Origo could have been considered an outlier. Then, Origo became one of <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 31 outlets</span> owned by Mr. Orban\u2019s allies, according to research by Atlatszo, an investigative news website.\nToday, there are more <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 500.</span>"}, "92520": {"id": "92520", "text": "<h3>Governor races in at least five states could determine abortion legality</h3>Helloo, good morning.

Whitmer has asked the state Supreme Court to strike down the ban as well.\n\nBut even if Dixon wins, a Republican-controlled legislature could have a hard time enacting bans on the procedure.

Follow our latest coverage of the Israeli election and its aftermath here.\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli opposition parties on Wednesday reached a coalition agreement to form a government and oust Benjamin Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history and a dominant figure who has pushed his nation\u2019s politics to the right.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The announcement by the parties could lead to the easing of a political impasse that has produced four elections in two years and left Israel without a stable government or a state budget.</span> If Parliament ratifies the fragile agreement in a confidence vote in the coming days, it will also bring down the curtain, if only for an intermission, on the premiership of a leader who has defined contemporary Israel more than any other.\nThe new coalition is an unusual and awkward alliance between eight political parties from a diverse array of ideologies, from the left to the far right. It includes the membership of a small Arab party called Raam, which would become the first Arab group to join a right-leaning coalition in Israeli history.\nWhile some analysts have hailed the coalition as reflecting the breadth and complexity of contemporary society, others say its members are too incompatible for their compact to last, and consider it the embodiment of Israel\u2019s political dysfunction.\nThe alliance would be led <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">until 2023 by</span> Naftali Bennett, a religiously observant former settler leader who opposes a Palestinian state and wants Israel to annex the majority of the occupied West Bank. He is a former ally of Mr. Netanyahu often described as more right-wing than the prime minister.\nIf the government lasts a whole term, it would then be led <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2023 and</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2025 by</span> Yair Lapid, a centrist former television host considered a standard-bearer for secular Israelis.\nThe son of American immigrants, Mr. Bennett,<span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 49,</span></span> is a former software entrepreneur, army commando, chief of staff to Mr. Netanyahu and defense minister. His home is in central Israel, but he was once chief executive of an umbrella group, the Yesha Council, that represents Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. Until the most recent election cycle, Mr. Bennett was part of a political alliance with Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right leader.\nThough Mr. Bennett\u2019s party, Yamina, won just seven of <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 120 seats</span></span> in Parliament, the anti-Netanyahu forces could not form a government without his support, allowing him to set the terms of his involvement in the coalition.\n<span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Mr. Lapid,<span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 57,</span> is a former news anchor and journalist who became a politician nine years ago and later served as finance minister in a Netanyahu-led coalition.</span> His party placed second in the general election in March, <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">winning 17 seats</span>. But Mr. Lapid considered the ouster of Mr. Netanyahu more important than demanding to go first as prime minister.\nYair Lapid, the leader of the Israeli opposition, had until midnight on Wednesday to cobble together an unlikely coalition to topple Benjamin Netanyahu. He needed almost every minute \u2014 leaving it until 11:22 p.m. to inform Reuven Rivlin, Israel\u2019s largely ceremonial president, that he had assembled an eight-party alliance.\n\u201cThe government will do everything it can to unite every part of Israeli society,\u201d Mr. Lapid said in a statement released shortly after his call with Mr. Rivlin.\nMr. Lapid\u2019s celebrations will be put on hold for several days, however. The speaker of the Israeli Parliament, Yariv Levin, is a member of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s party, Likud, and can use parliamentary procedure to delay the confidence vote until Monday, <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">June 14,</span> constitutional experts said.\nIn the meantime, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s party has promised to pile pressure on wavering members of Mr. Lapid\u2019s fragile coalition, formed of hard-right parties, leftists, centrists and Arab Islamists, in a bid to persuade them to abandon the coalition.

While Mr. Netanyahu eroded the idea of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr. Bennett, a religiously observant champion of Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, openly rejects the concept of a sovereign Palestinian state and has advocated annexing West Bank territory.\nStill, though the coalition will include several parties that disagree on both those issues, they have agreed to allow Mr. Bennett to become prime minister first.\nIf the coalition deal holds, Mr. Bennett would be replaced for the second part of the four-year term by Mr. Lapid, who advocates for secular, middle-class Israelis and whose party <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">won 17 seats</span>.\nBy conceding the first turn in the rotation, Mr. Lapid, who has been branded as a dangerous leftist by his opponents on the right, smoothed the way for other right-wing politicians to join the new anti-Netanyahu alliance.\nIn a measure of the plot twists and tumult behind this political turnaround, Mr. Bennett had pledged before the election not to enable a Lapid government of any kind or any government reliant on the Islamist party, called Raam.\nThe coalition would stand or fall on the cooperation between eight parties with disparate ideologies and, on many issues, clashing agendas.\nIn a televised address on Sunday night, Mr. Bennett said he was committed to fostering national unity.\n\u201cTwo thousand years ago, there was a Jewish state which fell here because of internal quarrels,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will not happen again.

In Israel\u2019s current, fragmented politics, which have produced four inconclusive elections in two years, that involves more than the usual level of skill, legal interpretation and discretion.\nThe president can also play an important role in Israeli diplomacy and has the power to pardon convicted criminals and exercise clemency by reducing or commuting sentences.\nMr. Herzog,<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 60,</span> the grandson of the first chief rabbi of Israel and the son of one of the country\u2019s earlier presidents, Chaim Herzog, will take over from the current president, Reuven Rivlin, in July.\n\u201cOur challenges are many and should not be taken lightly,\u201d Mr. Herzog said in his acceptance speech. \u201cI intend to be the president of all Israelis, to lend an attentive ear to every position and respect every person.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nLess than a month ago, an eruption of intense fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip plunged Israeli and Palestinian communities into chaos.

Gaza\u2019s infrastructure, already ailing, was gutted by Israeli airstrikes on the densely populated territory. And Israeli towns and cities within range of Hamas rockets went into repeated, frightening lockdowns in shelters.\nThe war also spurred unrest within Israel and the occupied territories that has been more explosive than any in years. It has inspired a new era of Palestinian activism, and has shifted the ground politically, coloring the drama that was playing out in Israel on Wednesday.\nHere is what to know about the 11-day war, and its lasting effects.\nJERUSALEM \u2014 For Israelis, the possible downfall of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the country\u2019s longest-serving leader, is an epochal moment. Israeli media have barraged their audiences with reports and commentary on the opposition attempts to form a government.\nBut for many Palestinians, the political drama has prompted little more than a shrug and a resurgence of bitter memories.\nDuring Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s current 12-year tenure, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process fizzled, as Israeli and Palestinian leaders accused each other of obstructing the process, and Mr. Netanyahu expressed increasing skepticism about the possibility of a sovereign Palestinian state.\nBut to many Palestinians, his likely replacement as prime minister, Naftali Bennett, would be no improvement. Mr. Bennett is Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s former chief of staff, and a former settler leader who outright rejects Palestinian statehood.\nInstead, many Palestinians are consumed by their own political moment, which some activists have framed as the most pivotal in decades.\nThe Palestinian polity has long been physically and politically fragmented between the American-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank; its archrival, Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza; a Palestinian minority inside Israel whose votes might make or break an Israeli government; and a sprawling diaspora.\nBut spurred by last month\u2019s 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and the worst bout of intercommunal Arab-Jewish violence to have convulsed Israel in decades, these disparate parts suddenly came together in a seemingly leaderless eruption of shared identity and purpose.\nIn a rare display of unity, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians observed a general strike on <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 12 across</span> Gaza, the West Bank, the refugee camps of Lebanon and inside Israel itself.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cI don\u2019t think whoever is in charge in Israel will make a great deal of difference to the Palestinians,\u201d said Ahmad Aweidah, the former head of the Palestinian stock exchange.</span> \u201cThere might be slight differences and nuances, but all mainstream Israeli parties, with slight exceptions on the extreme left, share pretty much the same ideology.\u201d\nThe strike in mid-May, Mr. Aweidah said, \u201cshowed that we are united no matter what the Israelis have tried to do <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 73 years</span>: categorizing us into Israeli Arabs, West Bankers, Jerusalemites, Gazans, refugees and diaspora.\u201d\n\u201cNone of that has worked,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are back to square one.\u201d", "displayed_text": "<h3>Looking to themselves, Palestinians expect little from Israeli changes.</h3>Wide-Ranging Israel Coalition Reaches Deal to Form Government\nNegotiating as the clock ran down, Israeli parties ranging from the left to the far right, including an Arab bloc, agreed on a coalition government.\nThis briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the Israeli election and its aftermath here.\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli opposition parties on Wednesday reached a coalition agreement to form a government and oust Benjamin Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history and a dominant figure who has pushed his nation\u2019s politics to the right.\n<span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The announcement by the parties could lead to the easing of a political impasse that has produced four elections in two years and left Israel without a stable government or a state budget.</span> If Parliament ratifies the fragile agreement in a confidence vote in the coming days, it will also bring down the curtain, if only for an intermission, on the premiership of a leader who has defined contemporary Israel more than any other.\nThe new coalition is an unusual and awkward alliance between eight political parties from a diverse array of ideologies, from the left to the far right. It includes the membership of a small Arab party called Raam, which would become the first Arab group to join a right-leaning coalition in Israeli history.\nWhile some analysts have hailed the coalition as reflecting the breadth and complexity of contemporary society, others say its members are too incompatible for their compact to last, and consider it the embodiment of Israel\u2019s political dysfunction.\nThe alliance would be led <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">until 2023 by</span> Naftali Bennett, a religiously observant former settler leader who opposes a Palestinian state and wants Israel to annex the majority of the occupied West Bank.

But Mr. Lapid considered the ouster of Mr. Netanyahu more important than demanding to go first as prime minister.\nYair Lapid, the leader of the Israeli opposition, had until midnight on Wednesday to cobble together an unlikely coalition to topple Benjamin Netanyahu. He needed almost every minute \u2014 leaving it until 11:22 p.m. to inform Reuven Rivlin, Israel\u2019s largely ceremonial president, that he had assembled an eight-party alliance.\n\u201cThe government will do everything it can to unite every part of Israeli society,\u201d Mr. Lapid said in a statement released shortly after his call with Mr. Rivlin.\nMr. Lapid\u2019s celebrations will be put on hold for several days, however.

So Mr. Bennett can either fall in with the opposition, who have offered him the chance to be prime minister \u2014 or force the country to a fifth election in little more than two years.\n\u201cWe always ask ourselves this question,\u201d Ms. Silman said on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cIs it right? Can we do something else?\u201d\nPatrick Kingsley and\nNaftali Bennett, who leads a small right-wing party, and Yair Lapid, the centrist leader of the Israeli opposition, have joined forces to try to form a diverse coalition to unseat Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister.\nSpanning Israel\u2019s fractious political spectrum from left to right, and relying on the support of a small Arab, Islamist party, the proposed coalition, dubbed the \u201cchange government\u201d by supporters, could signal a profound shift for Israel. Its leaders have pledged to end the cycle of divisive politics and inconclusive elections.\nThe opposition parties announced a coalition agreement on Wednesday. But even if they survive a vote of confidence in the Parliament and form a government, toppling Mr. Netanyahu, how much change would their \u201cchange government\u201d bring, when some of the parties agree on little else besides antipathy for Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader?\nMr. Bennett, whose party won seven seats in Parliament, is often described as further to the right than Mr. Netanyahu. While Mr. Netanyahu eroded the idea of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr. Bennett, a religiously observant champion of Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, openly rejects the concept of a sovereign Palestinian state and has advocated annexing West Bank territory.\nStill, though the coalition will include several parties that disagree on both those issues, they have agreed to allow Mr. Bennett to become prime minister first.\nIf the coalition deal holds, Mr. Bennett would be replaced for the second part of the four-year term by Mr. Lapid, who advocates for secular, middle-class Israelis and whose party <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">won 17 seats</span>.\nBy conceding the first turn in the rotation, Mr. Lapid, who has been branded as a dangerous leftist by his opponents on the right, smoothed the way for other right-wing politicians to join the new anti-Netanyahu alliance.\nIn a measure of the plot twists and tumult behind this political turnaround, Mr. Bennett had pledged before the election not to enable a Lapid government of any kind or any government reliant on the Islamist party, called Raam.\nThe coalition would stand or fall on the cooperation between eight parties with disparate ideologies and, on many issues, clashing agendas.\nIn a televised address on Sunday night, Mr. Bennett said he was committed to fostering national unity.\n\u201cTwo thousand years ago, there was a Jewish state which fell here because of internal quarrels,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will not happen again. Not on my watch.\u201d\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Even as the country and its Parliament remained deeply divided over the formation of a new government, Israeli lawmakers came together on Wednesday to elect a new president, Isaac Herzog, a former leader of the Labor party and government minister.\n</span>Displaying a rare degree of consensus in a secret ballot, they voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Herzog, who currently serves as the chairman of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency for Israel, which helps deal with immigration, interacts with the Jewish diaspora and runs social programs.\nThe president plays a mostly symbolic role as a national unifier in Israel\u2019s fractious parliamentary democracy, where the prime minister wields the most power.\nOne of a president\u2019s main responsibilities is to grant a candidate the task of forming a government after elections. In Israel\u2019s current, fragmented politics, which have produced four inconclusive elections in two years, that involves more than the usual level of skill, legal interpretation and discretion.\nThe president can also play an important role in Israeli diplomacy and has the power to pardon convicted criminals and exercise clemency by reducing or commuting sentences.\nMr. Herzog,<span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 60,</span> the grandson of the first chief rabbi of Israel and the son of one of the country\u2019s earlier presidents, Chaim Herzog, will take over from the current president, Reuven Rivlin, in July.\n\u201cOur challenges are many and should not be taken lightly,\u201d Mr. Herzog said in his acceptance speech. \u201cI intend to be the president of all Israelis, to lend an attentive ear to every position and respect every person.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nLess than a month ago, an eruption of intense fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip plunged Israeli and Palestinian communities into chaos. As the civilian casualties grew, overwhelmingly on the Gaza side, the conflict polarized Israeli society, and the world, in ways seldom seen before.\nAt <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 230 people</span> were killed in Gaza during the war, including at <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 65 children</span>, while in Israel at <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">least 12 were</span> killed, including two children. Gaza\u2019s infrastructure, already ailing, was gutted by Israeli airstrikes on the densely populated territory. And Israeli towns and cities within range of Hamas rockets went into repeated, frightening lockdowns in shelters.\nThe war also spurred unrest within Israel and the occupied territories that has been more explosive than any in years. It has inspired a new era of Palestinian activism, and has shifted the ground politically, coloring the drama that was playing out in Israel on Wednesday.\nHere is what to know about the 11-day war, and its lasting effects.\nJERUSALEM \u2014 For Israelis, the possible downfall of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the country\u2019s longest-serving leader, is an epochal moment. Israeli media have barraged their audiences with reports and commentary on the opposition attempts to form a government.\nBut for many Palestinians, the political drama has prompted little more than a shrug and a resurgence of bitter memories.\nDuring Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s current 12-year tenure, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process fizzled, as Israeli and Palestinian leaders accused each other of obstructing the process, and Mr. Netanyahu expressed increasing skepticism about the possibility of a sovereign Palestinian state.\nBut to many Palestinians, his likely replacement as prime minister, Naftali Bennett, would be no improvement. Mr. Bennett is Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s former chief of staff, and a former settler leader who outright rejects Palestinian statehood.\nInstead, many Palestinians are consumed by their own political moment, which some activists have framed as the most pivotal in decades.\nThe Palestinian polity has long been physically and politically fragmented between the American-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank; its archrival, Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza; a Palestinian minority inside Israel whose votes might make or break an Israeli government; and a sprawling diaspora.\nBut spurred by last month\u2019s 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and the worst bout of intercommunal Arab-Jewish violence to have convulsed Israel in decades, these disparate parts suddenly came together in a seemingly leaderless eruption of shared identity and purpose.\nIn a rare display of unity, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians observed a general strike on <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 12 across</span> Gaza, the West Bank, the refugee camps of Lebanon and inside Israel itself.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">\u201cI don\u2019t think whoever is in charge in Israel will make a great deal of difference to the Palestinians,\u201d said Ahmad Aweidah, the former head of the Palestinian stock exchange.</span> \u201cThere might be slight differences and nuances, but all mainstream Israeli parties, with slight exceptions on the extreme left, share pretty much the same ideology.\u201d\nThe strike in mid-May, Mr. Aweidah said, \u201cshowed that we are united no matter what the Israelis have tried to do <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">for 73 years</span>: categorizing us into Israeli Arabs, West Bankers, Jerusalemites, Gazans, refugees and diaspora.\u201d\n\u201cNone of that has worked,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are back to square one.\u201d"}, "Economic-Article-Annotation-end.html": {"id": "Economic-Article-Annotation-end.html", "text": "end", "displayed_text": "end"}}
