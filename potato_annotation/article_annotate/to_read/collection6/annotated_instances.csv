I believed in traditional reporting, but Trump changed me — and it should change the rest of the media too.
Perspective by Margaret Sullivan
<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 12,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2022 at</span> 10:00 a.m. EDT
Despite my nearly four decades in journalism, I was unprepared for the moment of no return that came on a July day <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span></span> as a blazing sun beat down on the streets of Cleveland. Walking around the grounds of the Republican National Convention, I was looking for a column idea. I was new at this, having started at The Washington Post only a few weeks earlier. Wandering and observing, I came upon a table of souvenirs, meant to appeal to the convention attendees who had arrived from all corners of the nation to cheer on the Republican Party’s nomination of Donald Trump. I already had seen some gleefully misogynistic anti-Clinton paraphernalia — “Hillary sucks but not like Monica” — but nothing measured up to the horror I felt as I registered the meaning of a T-shirt featuring the image of a noose and these words: “Rope. Tree. Journalist. Some assembly required.”
Over the weeks and months ahead, as I started to write what I hoped were well-reasoned Post columns about Trump’s relationship with the media, I felt an irrational anger coming at me like an unending blast from an industrial-strength hose. Trump hadn’t invented this anger, of course, but he certainly emboldened it — and used it for his own purposes. On social media, in phone messages, in emails I received, the sheer hatred from Trump supporters shocked and even frightened me. One, unsigned but from a “lifetime member of the NRA,” asserted that people like me wouldn’t be around much longer. Another, signed “A Real, True Patriot,” read:
“Though I would never read a manure-laden pile of toilet paper like Washington Compost, I heard about your Nazi column about ‘reaching the masses’ with your fake news to convince people that your leftist Nazi lies are truth. You are a well-trained serpent of the left, following communist orders as you were taught. ‘If you say and repeat a lie often enough, it will eventually be seen as truth’ — Lenin … Here’s what you (slithering, fake-news/propaganda- generating slimy slug) should do: Go fornicate yourself with a large, sharp knife, and then eat rat poison until your belly is stuffed.”
I was called the c-word repeatedly. One reader suggested I have my breasts cut off. I tried to let all this nastiness roll off my back and even found it amusing when a Post reader sent me an email calling me a “venomous serpent.” John Schwartz, then a reporter for the New York Times who had become a friend, suggested I treat it as a badge of honor and write a book titled “Memories of a Venomous Serpent.”
Now, six years later, we journalists know a lot more about covering Trump and his supporters. We’ve come a long way, but certainly made plenty of mistakes. Too many times, we acted as his stenographers or megaphones. Too often, we failed to refer to his many falsehoods as lies. It took too long to stop believing that, whenever he calmed down for a moment, he was becoming “presidential.” And it took too long to moderate our instinct to give equal weight to both sides, even when one side was using misinformation for political gain.
It’s been an education for all of us — a gradual realization that the instincts and conventions of traditional journalism weren’t good enough for this moment in our country’s history. As Trump prepares to run again <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2024,</span> it’s worth reminding ourselves of the lessons we’ve learned — and committing to the principle that, when covering politicians who are essentially running against democracy, old-style journalism will no longer suffice.
Back <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span></span> I was still looking for common ground with the Trump crowd. It fit with my background as a traditional newspaper journalist. During <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 13 years</span> as chief editor of the Buffalo News, ending <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> I had believed that I could listen to or communicate with our readers, whatever their politics — and I was registered to vote as a “blank.” Our editorial board, which I sat on, endorsed candidates from various parties, and I had courteous relationships with officeholders of all stripes. I frequently would go out to speak to civic organizations, such as rotary clubs, in the Buffalo-Niagara region with no regard for whether their members leaned right or left.
At the Cleveland airport after the convention, I interviewed one delegate, a concierge for a car dealership named Mary Sue McCarty, who wore a cowboy hat and pearls as she waited for her flight home to Dallas. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">She had her mind made up about the news media: “Journalists aren’t doing their jobs.</span> They are protecting a certain class.” <span id=""1"" class=""red"">When I pointed out that it was the New York Times that broke the consequential story about Hillary Clinton’s email practices and that mainstream media organizations had aggressively investigated the finances of the Clinton Foundation, she shrugged: “If it’s a Republican, it’s investigated to death.</span> If it’s a Democrat, it’s breezed over.”
This assertion could hardly have been more wrong. After all, the media’s endless emphasis on Clinton’s emails would prove to be a big factor in dooming her campaign. It simply wasn’t the case that the press was giving Democrats a pass.
Clearly, the empirical common ground I depended upon — and believed in — was eroding. Dealing with that growing reality over the next few years would change me as a journalist and even as a person. Some principles and beliefs, I found, were more important than appearing to get along with everyone or responding to criticism by offering to compromise or change course. Journalists have to stand, unwaveringly, for the truth — and if that meant being attacked by zealots who wanted to call such a position evidence of bias, I could live with that. For me, it would soon become a matter of simple integrity to acknowledge that some of the old-school rules and practices didn’t work anymore.

From this new vantage point, it seemed self-evident that the mainstream press was too often going easy on Trump. Well into his presidency, journalists didn’t want to use the word “lie” for Trump’s constant barrage of falsehoods. To lie, editors reasoned, means to intend to be untruthful. Since journalists couldn’t be inside politicians’ heads, how were we supposed to know if — by this definition — they were really lying? The logic eventually became strained, given that Trump blithely repeated the same rank mistruths over and over.
Too many reporters and their editors didn’t seem to want to figure out how to cover Trump properly. From the moment he descended the golden escalator at Manhattan’s Trump Tower in <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2015 to</span> announce his candidacy, the news media was in his thrall. Journalists couldn’t stop writing about him, showing him on TV and even broadcasting images of the empty stage waiting for him to arrive at a rally. Trump had described himself as “the ratings machine,” and for once he wasn’t exaggerating.
As I continued to tackle <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 campaign</span>, I criticized the press’s obsession with the former reality-TV star, yet I was caught up in it, too. I have no regrets about what I wrote, but I certainly was aware that if I wrote a column with Trump’s name in the headline, it probably would find a passionate audience: thousands of comments and retweets, hundreds of emails, requests to talk on TV. And because I wrote about the news media, and Trump never stopped using the news media as a foil, there was so much to say.
In every way, Trump was a deeply abnormal candidate, but the news media couldn’t seem to communicate that effectively or even grasp the problem. Instead, his every unhinged, middle-of-the-night tweet was covered like legitimate news. To be fair, the media was applying a standard that had made sense up until that moment: When a major presidential candidate says something provocative or worse, it’s newsworthy. The problem is that we were applying this old standard to a candidate who was exploiting it for his own purposes — while seeking to undermine democracy itself.

In the late afternoon of Nov.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> Election Day, I walked into The Post’s newsroom with a column already started about Hillary Clinton’s supposedly inevitable victory. A few hours later, I was scrambling, just like every reporter, editor and commentator. My colleagues and I watched the television screens placed all around the newsroom as one battleground state after another fell to Trump.
Tossing away my useless column, I wrote that the media coverage of <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 race</span> had been, as I put it, “an epic fail.” <span id=""2"" class=""red"">They — and I would include myself in this criticism — employed a kind of magical thinking: A Trump presidency shouldn’t happen, therefore it won’t happen.
</span>Soon, word filtered down from the boss, Marty Baron, that I should produce a second column before I left the newsroom that night. He wanted me to write my recommendations for how the traditional press should cover the new president. So, I wrote a call to arms for American journalists: “Journalists are going to have to be better — stronger, more courageous, stiffer-spined — than they’ve ever been.” I filed it, not at all convinced that I’d written anything worthwhile on this momentous night, said good night to my editor and headed out of the newsroom <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 3 a</span>.m.
Stunned and spent, I walked slowly through the deserted streets of downtown Washington. As I neared my apartment, I could see the U.S. Capitol, that seemingly inviolable symbol of American democracy, off to the east. Lit from within, it glowed an ethereal white in the darkness.
In every way, Trump was a deeply abnormal candidate, but the news media couldn’t seem to communicate that effectively or even grasp the problem.
As we would learn over the coming years, the Capitol was not inviolable, and neither is the democracy it represents. American democracy is now on the edge of a precipice. What can members of the press do to help keep it from tipping over as <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2024 campaign</span> looms? What should we have learned since that summer in 2016?
For one thing, I’m convinced that journalists — specifically those who cover politics — must keep a sharp focus on truth-seeking, not old-style performative neutrality. Does that mean we throw objectivity out the window? Of course not. We should be resolutely objective in the sense of seeking evidence and approaching subjects with an open mind. We should not, however, resort to taking everything down the middle, no matter what. Rather than, for example, having equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats (or conservatives and progressives) on every talk show, or devoting equal numbers of words to each side of a political argument, we should be thinking about what coverage serves the public best.
Those who deny the outcome of <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span></span> certainly don’t deserve a media megaphone for that enduring lie, one that is likely to reemerge in the presidential campaign ahead. But the media should go one step further: When covering such a politician in other contexts — for example, about abortion rights or gun control — journalists should remind audiences that this public figure is an election denier.
That’s exactly the model pursued by WITF, a public radio station in Harrisburg, Pa., which decided to remind its audience on a regular basis that some Republican state legislators and members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation had opposed the transfer of power to Joe Biden, despite the lack of evidence to support their claims of election fraud. A story on the station’s website about a state legislator’s efforts to get Pennsylvanians vaccinated was accompanied by a sidebar of text about his behavior after the election. On-air stories have used a tagline to accomplish the same purpose. The decision wasn’t easy, one editor told me, “because this is not the normal thing.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Advertisement
Unfortunately, many media organizations — increasingly owned these days by huge corporations or hedge funds — seem more interested in ratings and profits than in serving the public interest.</span> So, they are extremely hesitant to offend groups of viewers or voters, including the many Republicans who have signed on to the lie about <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span></span> being stolen. The new boss of CNN, Chris Licht, raised eyebrows when he made the rounds on Capitol Hill a few months ago to assure Republican leaders that members of their party would be treated fairly on the network that had been one of the former president’s favorite punching bags. One conservative publication, the Washington Free Beacon, called Licht’s unusual outreach an “apology tour.” Given all this, it’s difficult to picture CNN consistently alerting viewers that a politician is an election denier, even when discussing a different subject. Yet that’s exactly the type of bold measure that is needed.
Media people — not just reporters but their editors and top leaders of newsrooms — also need to take a hard, critical look at the types of stories that constitute traditional campaign coverage. That coverage has historically leaned on such things as live footage of speeches, rallies and debates; on “horse race” articles based on polls or conventional wisdom; and on blowing up small conflicts (campaign staff in disarray!) into major stories. These modes of coverage can have the effect of normalizing a candidate who should not be normalized. They also often constitute a distraction at a time when huge swaths of one party are essentially running against democratic practices.
By no means am I counseling that journalists act as if they are “on the team” of Trump’s rivals. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">That’s not our job.</span> At the same time, we have to be aware that covering someone who doesn’t care about democratic norms — even something as basic as the peaceful transfer of power — requires different judgments about what stories really matter, and how we should or should not cover them.
In making these judgments, we have to relentlessly explain ourselves to our readers, viewers and listeners. Although it didn’t involve Trump, a good example of this came over the summer when the Plain Dealer newspaper in Cleveland decided against covering a rally for U.S. Senate candidate J.D. Vance featuring Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis because of the absurdly restrictive rules the campaign had tried to impose, including a prohibition against interviewing attendees who weren’t approved by rally organizers. Instead, the Plain Dealer published white space, with a note to readers written by editor Chris Quinn headlined, “We reject the free speech-trampling rules set by J.D. Vance and Ron DeSantis for covering their rally.” Quinn was blunt: “Think about what they were doing here. They were staging an event to rally people to vote for Vance while instituting the kinds of policies you’d see in a fascist regime.”
Of course, the press must be just as tough on Democrats, should they adopt similar tactics or start lying all the time or trashing governmental norms. The standards should be the same for all. But journalists shouldn’t shy away from the unavoidable truth: Most of this is coming from Trump-style Republicans.
Perhaps the most important thing journalists can do as they cover the campaign ahead is to provide thoughtful framing and context. They shouldn’t just repeat what’s being said, but help explain what it means. This is especially important in headlines and news alerts, which are about as far as many news consumers get. When Trump rants about the supposed horrors of rigged elections and voting fraud, journalists have to constantly provide the counterweight of truth. We have gotten better at this <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2016.</span> Now we have to stick to it.
All of these suggestions go against the grain of traditional politics coverage. Undoubtedly, this approach will draw accusations of bias from the right; undoubtedly, journalists and news leaders will be put on the defensive. They’ll need to get over that. The stakes are enormously high. Doing things the same old way isn’t remotely appropriate. By now, that’s something we all should have learned.

Sitting before a parliamentary oversight committee last month, two top executives from Tanzania Petroleum Development Corp. declined to reveal details of billions of dollars in gas contracts that the state company had signed with foreign investors. Parliamentarians had a sharp riposte: They called the police.

The two company board members had argued they needed permission from their investors before they disclosed details of the deal. But soon after a police officer showed up, the executives were fumbling with their paperwork, according to lawmakers who attended the hearing—but in the end, they didn’t release any documents.

The executives were escorted out of the parliamentary building and into a police truck. They were briefly taken into custody, detained for a few hours and released without charges.

“Companies must accept the era of secrecy is over,” says Zitto Kabwe, the head of the Tanzanian parliament’s public-accounts committee, who witnessed the scene.

TPDC declined to comment on the police detention of its executives, and Tanzania’s ministry of energy and minerals didn’t respond to requests for comment.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Battles over contract transparency are brewing across Africa, touching on sensitive tax issues among energy and mineral giants trying to tap into a new frontier of the global economy.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The clashes show how once-malleable African governments are fighting for a bigger share of earnings in sometimes-secretive deals, often following the advice of Western groups such as the Soros Foundation and the African Governance Initiative, which is headed by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

</span>The upshot: A raft of legal disputes that have stalled production of some key projects and frayed relationships between African governments and foreign investors.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Uganda remains embroiled in a litany of tax disputes with Tullow Oil PLC and Heritage Oil Corp., nearly a decade after oil reserves were discovered.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The country had amended its income-tax law to introduce a capital-gains tax on the sale of oil rights shortly after the discoveries, prompting Heritage and Tullow to contest the new tax assessments.

</span>Zambia’s mining industry is faltering after the government in October decided to more than triple mine royalties <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 20%,</span> following the advice of Western groups. This compelled miners such as First Quantum Minerals Ltd. and Glencore PLC to <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">suspend $2 billion</span> in expansion projects.

And in Guinea, disputes stemming from government changes to a lease for the Simandou iron-ore mine are dogging the project.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Some experts argue the disputes reveal a blurring between demands for more disclosure from investors and more tax revenue from governments.</span> “It’s about negotiating to get a better deal in terms of money ... <span id=""9"" class=""red"">income, but not necessarily transparency,” says Carlos Lopes, the chief of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.

</span>African governments have found ready partners for both endeavors. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Western organizations such as the Soros Foundation, founded by hedge-fund billionaire George Soros, and international institutions like the United Nations and the World Bank are providing advisory services to resource-rich nations on how to adjust ownership structures and rejigger tax laws for a bigger slice of revenues.

</span>Some analysts say this is a necessary tilting of the scales toward African governments.

“The deals often favor the companies which have access to vast experience and capital, while the governments do not have the experience, institutions or laws in place to manage their natural resources,” says George Boden, an analyst with U.K.-based anticorruption group Global Witness.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The African Governance Initiative—headed by Mr. Blair—has helped Rwanda become the region’s first country to issue mining certificates at the point of export, in an effort to keep conflict minerals out of the supply chain.

</span>In Guinea, Mr. Soros, through his foundations, played a key role in advising the government on its review of mining deals struck by previous governments. This led to the ouster of BSG Resources, the mining arm of Israeli tycoon Beny Steinmetz’s family-owned conglomerate, from the country earlier this year and the ushering in of Rio Tinto PLC.

Mr. Steinmetz has since sued Global Witness—partly funded by the Soros Foundation—which accused his company of obtaining mining rights in the country through corruption. BSG also is in international arbitration with Guinea in a bid to win compensation for being stripped of the Simandou mine. BSG Resources has denied wrongdoing and accused President Alpha Condé’s government of seeking to expropriate its rights by stealth—a claim the government rejects.

Simandou’s current operator Rio Tinto has also sued rival Vale SA and Mr. Steinmetz, alleging that they colluded to rob the Anglo-Australian company of the highly prized iron-ore concession, further complicating the legal battles around the mine. Both parties denied Rio Tinto’s allegations, which a BSG Resources spokesman called “baseless and bizarre.”

In Tanzania, the recent police detention of the oil-company executives capped months of a simmering row at the local parliament over whether the East African nation is getting a fair deal for its newfound vast natural-gas resources.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mr. Kabwe’s fight to make all contracts public kicked off in August, when part of the contract with Norway’s Statoil ASA and ExxonMobil Corp. was leaked to the local press, showing that the state-run Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation, or TPDC, had agreed to terms yielding 30%-50% of the revenue for state coffers—well below the 50%-80% yields recommended by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

</span>Tanzania <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009 signed</span> the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, an effort led by non-governmental organizations to bring contracts to light. Though most of Africa’s other mineral-rich nations also are signatories, implementation has been uneven.

Mr. Kabwe, who heads the parliament’s public-accounts committee, ordered TPDC to bring all contracts to parliament for scrutiny, but the state-run company cited investor reluctance to publicize the terms. It didn’t comply with a Nov.<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 deadline</span>—at which point the two senior TPDC board members were briefly taken into custody.

An official with TPDC said that confidentiality clauses in the deals prevent the state company from revealing them to third parties.

ExxonMobil, the minority partner in the venture, referred questions to Statoil. Knut Rostad, a spokesman for Statoil, said the deal was “balanced and comparable to commercial terms in other places with similar risks.” He added that his company was making a long-term commitment to the country and has already spent <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $1.5 billion</span> on exploration.

But Mr. Rostad said he wouldn’t comment on parliamentary debates or police detention of TPDC executives. He confirmed his company didn’t release the contracts but declined to answer why, given the demands of the Tanzanian parliament.

66574421e5b48f8b30994340,30538,"<h3>The Website That Shows How a Free Press Can Die</h3>BUDAPEST — Hungary’s leading news website, Origo, had a juicy scoop: A top aide to the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, had used state money to pay for sizable but unexplained expenses during secret foreign trips. The story embarrassed Mr. Orban and was a reminder that his country still had an independent press.
But that was <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span> Today, Origo is one of the prime minister’s most dutiful media boosters, parroting his attacks on migrants and on George Soros, the Hungarian-American philanthropist demonized by the far right on both sides of the Atlantic.
And if Origo once dug into Mr. Orban’s government, it now pounces on his political opponents.
“Let’s look at the affairs of Laszlo Botka!” a headline blared earlier this month in a salacious take on the only mayor of a major Hungarian city not aligned with Mr. Orban’s party, Fidesz. “Serious scandals, mysteries surround the socialist mayor of Szeged.”
If little known outside Hungary, Origo is now a cautionary tale for an age in which democratic norms and freedom of expression are being challenged globally — and President Trump and other leaders have intensified attacks on the free press.
In many ways, Hungary has foreshadowed the democratic backsliding now evident in different corners of the world. Since winning power <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span></span></span> Mr. Orban has steadily eroded institutional checks and balances, especially the independent media. His government now oversees state-owned news outlets, while his allies control most of the country’s private media sources, creating a virtual echo chamber for Mr. Orban’s far right, anti-immigrant views.
The story of Origo’s transformation from independent news source to government cheerleader offers a blueprint of how Mr. Orban and his allies pulled this off. Rather than a sudden and blatant power grab, the effort was subtle but determined, using a quiet pressure campaign.
Origo’s editors were never imprisoned and its reporters were never beaten up. But in secret meetings — including a pivotal one in Vienna — the website’s original owner, a German-owned telecommunications company, relented. The company, Magyar Telekom, first tried self-censorship. Then it sought a nonpartisan buyer.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">But, ultimately, Origo went to the family of Mr. Orban’s former finance minister.
</span>“When Orban came to power <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span></span></span> his aim was to eliminate the media’s role as a check on government,” said Attila Mong, a former public radio anchor and a critic of Mr. Orban. “Orban wanted to introduce a regime which keeps the facade of democratic institutions but is not operated in a democratic manner — and a free press doesn’t fit into that picture.”
On the surface, Hungary’s democratic institutions seem to be operating normally. The judiciary is nominally independent. Elections are held. Newsstands are stacked with dozens of private publications.
“We would never sink so low,” Mr. Orban said in a September speech, “as to silence those with whom we disagree.”
But below the surface, the system has been degraded. The Constitutional Court is stacked with judges appointed by Fidesz. The judiciary and the prosecution service are headed by two of Mr. Orban’s oldest supporters. Both the electoral system and the electoral map have been altered to favor Mr. Orban’s party.
Other than a handful of mainly online outlets, the Hungarian media has been either silent about or supportive of these moves.
According to Freedom House’s press freedom index, Hungary’s media was judged the 87th freest in the world <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span></span> down from joint 40th <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span></span></span> when Mr. Orban entered office.
The index now labels Hungarian media as only “partly free,” while Hungary’s wider political system, once classified as a “consolidated democracy,” has been downgraded to “semi-consolidated democracy.”
And the fate of Origo, Mr. Mong said, is “very symbolic” of that transition.
A Secret Meeting
<span id=""1"" class=""red""><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span></span> Origo was Hungary’s most-read news website, renowned for its hard-nosed investigations into the likes of Lajos Simicska, a friend of Mr. Orban who had long financed his party.
</span>By then, Mr. Orban’s appointees controlled the state media, as well as Hungary’s two main media regulators. He had given regulators more power to fine and punish independent news outlets, or to drive them off air, yet Origo did not seem cowed.
The site had been created in the late 1990s by Magyar Telekom, the country’s leading telecoms company, to lure subscribers to its fledgling internet service. Over time, though, Origo evolved into a journalistic force with its own identity.
But as Origo thrived, its parent company faced challenges.
Since the start of the cellphone era, Magyar Telekom had been Hungary’s leading telecommunications company. When Deutsche Telekom, the German telecoms giant which also owns T-Mobile, bought a majority stake in the company <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2005,</span> Magyar Telekom was considered a marquee purchase.
But things changed with Mr. Orban’s election <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">He levied an “emergency” tax on the telecoms sector, in a bid to reduce government debt after the global financial crisis.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The tax was also seen as part of a wider backlash against foreign firms that had bought up large sections of the Hungarian economy after the fall of communism.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">For Magyar Telekom, it meant an <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $100 million</span> tax bill.</span> Company executives feared more bad news <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span></span> when Mr. Orban’s government was due to renew its frequency licenses. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Ahead of a September deadline, negotiations would determine how much of the market would be assigned to Telekom, and at what price.
</span>The talks were not going well. Months before the deadline, René Obermann, Deutsche Telekom’s C.E.O., became embroiled in a shouting match with Mr. Orban at a private meeting in Germany, two people briefed on the exchange said.
Throughout the year, Magyar Telekom executives met with Janos Lazar, Mr. Orban’s second-in-command, to negotiate the license renewal and a multimillion-dollar contract to install broadband internet throughout rural Hungary. Initially, Origo was not a topic of discussion.
But that changed in the early summer at a secret meeting in Vienna between Mr. Lazar and two senior company executives, according to three people with knowledge of the discussion. Mr. Lazar said that Origo’s journalists had historically struggled to grasp the government’s perspective on certain matters and proposed a remedy: a secret line of communication between Origo’s editors and the highest levels of government.
Mr. Lazar was careful not to frame the request as a quid pro quo for new licenses, or as a form of censorship. But the Magyar Telekom executives took it seriously.
By autumn, Origo had signed a contract with a media consultancy run by Attila Varhegyi, the former director of Mr. Orban’s party. As a consultant, Mr. Varhegyi had played a major role in turning Hungarian state media into a mouthpiece for Mr. Orban and now his attention had pivoted to the private sector.
Under the deal, Mr. Varhegyi’s firm could call Origo’s editor with suggestions about coverage.
That same month, the government extended its license agreements with the country’s three mobile telephone operators.
Magyar Telekom was awarded the biggest share.
Both Magyar Telekom and its parent company declined to comment on the Vienna meeting and Mr. Varhegyi. But in a general statement, Magyar Telekom said: “Dialogue between the government in office and the management of Magyar Telekom is a matter of fact, but its aim has never been to limit publicity or the freedom of press.”
Mr. Varhegyi and Mr. Lazar turned down several interview requests and ignored requests for comment.
An Editor Fired
Outraged, Origo’s editor in chief resigned, refusing to participate in the deal. But his replacement, Gergo Saling, appeared undaunted.
By <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2014,</span> Mr. Saling’s team had even launched an investigation into Mr. Lazar’s foreign travel expenses. Requests by Mr. Varhegyi’s firm to slow the project down were ignored.
But Mr. Saling was living on borrowed time.
The investigation was embarrassing to Magyar Telekom: Mr. Lazar had overseen the company’s license renewal and discussions were still underway over the contract to install broadband in the countryside.
Mr. Lazar complained about the story in a meeting with two Magyar Telekom executives in <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2014,</span> according to two people with knowledge of the discussion, and his disapproval was quickly relayed to Origo’s management. It was one of several attempts by Magyar Telekom management, and Mr. Varhegyi’s firm, to sway the investigation, both before and after the broadband deal was announced later that month, according to four people familiar with the controversy.
Undeterred, Mr. Saling’s journalists continued to scrutinize Mr. Lazar’s travel. They eventually began court proceedings to request specific travel records, and published several embarrassing stories about the minister’s movements.
But by the start of summer, Mr. Saling’s superiors had run out of patience. Mr. Orban had won re-election in April. Mr. Saling was fired in early June, nominally by mutual agreement.
The decision was ultimately made by Miklos Vaszily, Origo’s chief executive. But it came only after months of pressure on Mr. Vaszily from Magyar Telekom’s management and Mr. Varhegyi’s firm, according to three people at the company.
In protest, several of Origo’s best reporters resigned.
For Magyar Telekom, Origo had become a public relations liability and a political hindrance, and executives wanted to sell.
Flush With Government Cash
<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Throughout 2014,</span> Magyar Telekom held talks with prospective buyers but decided against a private sale. The Lazar scandal had caused a public outcry, as critics accused the company of bending to political pressure. Executives wanted the deal to be beyond reproach, so an open bidding process was announced in <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2015 and</span> overseen by Ernst and Young, an international accountancy firm.
The winner was named in November 2015: a firm called New Wave Media, which outbid two rival companies.
New Wave’s profile immediately raised eyebrows. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Their bid was financed by funds controlled by two banks, one owned by Mr. Orban’s government, and another owned by Tamas Szemerey, a cousin of one of Mr. Orban’s former ministers.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">In addition, New Wave was part-owned by Mr. Szemerey’s longtime business partner, company records show.
</span>Mr. Szemerey had made earlier attempts to buy Origo directly. But by his own telling, Magyar Telekom executives had discouraged such a direct attempt, on the grounds that he would be perceived as too close to the government.
Yet Mr. Szemerey ended up helping to pay for Origo all the same.
There was no evidence of favoritism: New Wave had simply made the highest bid. But bolstered by money from the state, New Wave could afford to pay whatever it took to avoid the outlet being sold to businesses not aligned with the government.
“We did not want it in the hands of Soros, or in the hands of people outside Hungary, or people who wanted to influence Hungarian politics against the Hungarian government,” Mr. Szemerey said in an interview.
Magyar Telekom and Deutsche Telekom declined to comment on Mr. Szemerey’s contacts with Telekom officials, but said the deal had been conducted transparently.
Though nominally still private, Origo now became a vessel for the government. Bought in part with government money, Origo now published news that echoed the government’s stance — in particular on migration, Mr. Soros, and the European Union, whose officials have frequently criticized Mr. Orban.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Before, Origo had struggled financially.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Now it was flush with government advertising revenue, which more than tripled following the sale.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span></span> the son of Mr. Orban’s former finance minister became New Wave’s CEO and government advertising revenues kept rising, even as Origo’s coverage became even more aggressively pro-Orban.
</span>At the time, <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 sale</span> of Origo could have been considered an outlier. Then, Origo became one of <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 31 outlets</span> owned by Mr. Orban’s allies, according to research by Atlatszo, an investigative news website.

66574421e5b48f8b30994340,49862,"<h3>Analysis | AT&T’s ill-fated media play cost it both time and money</h3>AT&T today is a less valuable, more heavily indebted company than it was <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016 when</span> it announced plans to acquire Time Warner and create a media-communications colossus that would dazzle consumers and shower investors with riches.
Now AT&T’s leadership is back with a new plan: unwinding the deal it once touted as “the model that wins over time.” The company said last week it would spin off its WarnerMedia unit in a <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">complex $43 billion</span> deal that unites it with Discovery Inc. in a new publicly-traded entity.
John Stankey, AT&T’s chief executive, called the company’s latest transformative transaction “an opportunity to unlock value” — leaving unanswered the question of who had locked up the value in the first place.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">While AT&T insists its Time Warner acquisition has paid off financially, many analysts said the telecommunications giant <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">squandered $100 billion</span> on a dalliance with the media and entertainment worlds that could have been better spent elsewhere.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">“Telecom companies have no business whatsoever buying assets that are outside their core expertise,” said Allyn Arden, director at S&P Global Corporate Ratings.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“This was a business they had no business being in.”
AT&T’s pursuit of a comprehensive telecom-media-entertainment strategy certainly left investors unimpressed.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The phone company’s share price barely advanced during a period when stocks more than doubled in value.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">From the announcement of Time Warner’s acquisition to word of its spinoff, shares of AT&T gained <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 12.6 percent</span> compared to <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 112.7 percent</span> increase in the S&<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500.</span>
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The company’s market capitalization — the value of all its outstanding stock — has fallen by <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 percent</span> since the end <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2016,</span> according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">After bingeing on debt — and eliminating <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 45,000 jobs</span> — AT&T confronts a future as the nation’s third-largest provider of wireless services and the No.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 broadband</span> company.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">AT&T’s latest reinvention also is bad news for many retail shareholders.</span> The company has long paid a generous dividend, attracting legions of mom-and-pop investors seeking dependable retirement payouts.
But shedding WarnerMedia will shrink annual dividends by nearly half, from <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $15 billion</span> to between <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $8 billion</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $8.6 billion</span>, the company said.
AT&T shareholders will <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">own 71 percent</span> of the new Discovery, so they will benefit from its future growth. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But many current AT&T investors didn’t sign up for the often bumpy ride of a media growth stock.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">They want reliable income.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">“A lot of holders of AT&T stock are interested in a dividend.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The stock is going to be a lot less attractive to that class of individual investors,” said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, senior counselor at the nonprofit Benton Institute for Broadband and Society.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">One sign of how widely felt AT&T’s cut will be: The Vanguard Group, which holds the company’s shares in dozens of its mutual funds, including the Total Stock Market Index Fund, the world’s largest single fund, is the company’s top shareholder.
</span>By AT&T’s calculations, it’s already made billions of dollars on its original Time Warner deal and expects to make even more through the union of Discovery’s reality television programming and WarnerMedia’s CNN, HBO and Warner Bros. Studios.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">In the deal with Discovery, AT&T shareholders will get stock in the new company.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Based on Discovery’s stock price on <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 14,</span> the day before the transaction was disclosed, those shares would be <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth $59 billion</span></span>.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">AT&T will <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">get $43 billion</span> in cash, securities and WarnerMedia’s agreement to <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">retain $1.5 billion</span> of its debt.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">The telecom giant already has booked an <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $5 billion</span> by selling off WarnerMedia assets, including its stake in the streaming service Hulu, plus billions in cash it’s received from the business <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2018.</span>
</span>“We’re comfortably above <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $100 billion</span> total value we paid when we bought Time Warner,” said Fletcher Cook, AT&T’s vice president for corporate communications.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Yet Discovery’s stock has sagged <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 12 percent</span> since the deal was announced — and the transaction is not scheduled to close until the middle of next year — calling into question whether AT&T’s stake in the new Discovery is really <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth $59 billion</span></span>.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">AT&T’s math also doesn’t include the opportunity cost of <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spending $100 billion</span> on TimeWarner rather than alternatives, such as building out the wireless network needed for an Internet-of-things future.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Limited by the debt it had taken on in the original Time Warner deal, AT&T this year was outspent by Verizon nearly 2-to-1 when the federal government auctioned off mid-band spectrum for 5G networks.</span> As rival Verizon <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">committed $53 billion</span>, AT&T could muster <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only $27 billion</span> for a contest that will be critical to its future.
“If they didn’t have DirecTV and WarnerMedia, they would have gone full throttle on C-band and spent closer <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $50 billion</span>. They were hamstrung,” Arden said.
For AT&T, the about-face on WarnerMedia marks a significant strategic shift after decades of buying and selling other companies.
The corporate saga began <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1984,</span> when the original Bell system was split into the long distance provider AT&T and seven regional phone companies.
More than a decade later, after Congress passed landmark legislation designed to fuel competition among landline, wireless and media companies, AT&T began a series of acquisitions that slowly reassembled much of what had been broken up.
<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2015,</span> it acquired DirecTV before announcing plans to snap up Time Warner the following year. That purchase was delayed when the Trump administration launched an unsuccessful legal challenge on antitrust grounds.
“AT&T has been an acquisition machine for decades. It’s been instrumental to their growth,” said Scott Cleland, president of Precursor, a research consultancy. “Eventually, that strategy ran out of gas.”
Many analysts say the company would have been better off never having gotten involved with Time Warner or DirecTV, the satellite operator it acquired <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 for</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $67 billion</span>. The strategy of owning both media and telecommunications businesses under a single corporate roof, they say, was ill-conceived.
“AT&T is probably getting out of this, at best, break-even or slightly better than that,” said David Barden, senior telecom analyst for Bank of America.
AT&T’s move comes just two weeks after Verizon unloaded its media assets, Yahoo and AOL, in <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $5 billion</span> sale to Apollo Global Management, a private equity firm. But Verizon’s media mistake was far less expensive: It spent <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just $9 billion</span> to acquire the two fading Internet-era stars <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 and</span><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017,</span> at a fraction of what AT&T spent.
AT&T belatedly recognized that making a global success of HBO Max against fierce competition from Netflix and Disney Plus would have required daunting investments. Facing a choice between doubling down and getting out, the company blinked.
“They decided their core competency was connectivity not content,” said Barden, who thinks management made the right call.
As investors mulled the outlook for AT&T and the new Discovery-WarnerMedia combination, it was clear that AT&T has been forced to abandon its ambitious plans and retreat to its roots as a communications company.
Yet AT&T may finally have stumbled onto a promising strategy, as the Discovery deal addresses some of its acknowledged weaknesses. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Executives plan to devote all of <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $43 billion</span> raised by the WarnerMedia spinoff to shrinking the company’s debt load, which has grown <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $169 billion</span>.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">That should accelerate ongoing debt reduction efforts by one year and free up the company to increase spending on its wireless network and to more than double <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 30 million</span> homes its fiber broadband connections, executives said.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">In the short run, AT&T stock may be depressed as dividend-seeking retail investors sell.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">But eventually, professional fund managers who in the past have been underwhelmed by the company’s strategy and repelled by its high debt load will be attracted to the new plan, Barden said.
</span>“AT&T bit off more than they could chew,” said Jeff Kagan, an industry consultant. “But it remains a powerful, strong company.”",,,,,,,,1,,,,,3,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,
66574421e5b48f8b30994340,28063,"<h3>Discovery’s departure is ‘shot across the bow’ for Silver Spring, state and region</h3>Across the street from Discovery Communications’ towering headquarters in downtown Silver Spring, Jay Ayaba eyed the line of customers at the Starbucks where he works as a shift supervisor. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">It was almost time for an early afternoon surge, overwhelmingly made up of Discovery employees whom Ayaba has come to know by name, face and order — such as Susie and her extra-hot decaf latte.
</span>“This might be a Discovery rush right here,” Ayaba said, looking over his shoulder.
Ayaba,<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24,</span> remembers how much Discovery’s arrival enlivened Silver Spring. He says it was as if “a whole new community had been built overnight.” <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Now he’s worried about the impact of the company’s announcement Tuesday that it will move its corporate headquarters to New York and relocate most of <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 1,300 Maryland</span> jobs.
</span>“We’re still going to be open,” Ayaba said, “but it’s going to be slower than usual around here.”
Plenty of others share his concerns. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Discovery’s exit will cost Montgomery County and Maryland tens of millions of dollars in lost payroll, tax receipts and vendor sales.</span> It will deprive Silver Spring of the high-profile anchor company — perhaps best-known for airing “Shark Week” — that sparked the suburb’s commercial revival beginning in the late 1990s. It will also force the county to find a new occupant for the landmark edifice close to the Silver Spring Metro station.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">In addition, for the greater Washington region, Discovery’s decision stirred fresh anxiety about structural weaknesses in the area’s economy that hamper its ability to compete for top-quality companies.</span> The headquarters move — largely to be closer to the entertainment industry mecca that is New York — cripples hopes that the Washington region can develop as a national hub for broadcast and digital entertainment media.
[Discovery Communications is selling Md. headquarters and moving to New York.]
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Montgomery’s failed effort to retain several hundred back-office jobs also highlighted the challenges posed by the area’s high prices.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Discovery is moving those positions to Knoxville, Tenn., where it said the cost of living is <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 40 percent</span> lower.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">“It’s unfortunate because this is exactly the type of company Washington is trying to attract: a business that isn’t dependent on government spending and can help diversify the economy,” said Stephen S. Fuller, a regional economist at George Mason University.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“It does damage to our brand and the brand we would like to have, that the Washington area is a good place to do business,” Fuller said.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Discovery executives and Maryland elected officials pushed back against the notion that the company’s decision resulted from an unattractive business climate.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">They said the change was inevitable because of Discovery’s acquisition, <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $14.6 billion</span> cash-and-stock deal that is still in progress, of Scripps Networks Interactive, owner of HGTV, Food Network and the Travel Channel.
</span>The new company would have major offices in three locations — New York, Silver Spring and Knoxville — and it made sense to consolidate operations and reduce that number to two.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">“Our decision has nothing to do with incentives or the business environment in Montgomery County,” chief corporate operating officer David C. Leavy said.</span> “We’ve had a wonderful run [here].”
[Turnabout as fair play? Md. Democrats roast Hogan over Discovery’s move to New York.]
Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said top Discovery executives told him there was nothing the state could have done to prevent the loss.
“They assured us it didn’t have anything to do with Maryland,” Hogan said. “They’re simply going through a merger, as most media outlets are.”
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">But there was no disguising the sobering reality that the state lost out to New York for the high-end, creative jobs — some of which will also go to Los Angeles — and to Tennessee for the low-end positions.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Some technology jobs will also cross the river to Sterling, Va., while several hundred positions will remain in Maryland.
</span>“This is a shot across the bow for this region,” said Bob Buchanan, chairman of <span id=""13"" class=""red"">the Montgomery County Economic Development Corp.</span> “We need to seriously address some of these challenges.”
Discovery’s departure is particularly bitter because it was a homegrown success story, a company founded in Landover <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1985 that</span> grew to be an international powerhouse. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Its exit follows an all-too-familiar pattern in which start-ups take root here, blossom and then are plucked away, often through takeovers, to go to more nurturing business ecosystems.
</span>“We don’t seem to be able to hold on to companies as they scale and become successful,” Fuller said. “Businesses are realizing they get a bigger bang for their buck if they go elsewhere.”
From its origins as the Discovery Channel, dedicated to documentaries and nonfiction television programming, Discovery Communications added channels such as TLC, Animal Planet, the Science Channel and OWN (the Oprah Winfrey Network).
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Discovery was lured to downtown Silver Spring in the late 1990s, when Montgomery County offered an incentives package worth more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $10 million</span> in tax credits, grants and loans to set up shop there.
</span>The company built <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $165 million</span>, 10-story tower. The move was the primary catalyst for the revival of Silver Spring, which enjoyed a surge of development including new restaurants, theaters and minority-owned small businesses.
Discovery’s arrival “put Silver Spring on the map and made it a center of documentary work around the world,” said Doug Duncan, who was Montgomery county executive at the time.
<span id=""16"" class=""red""><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Since 2000,</span> the company has <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">received $12.3 million</span> in local and state tax incentives, grants and loans, according to Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks subsidies.
</span>The company’s departure is “devastating for Silver Spring,” Duncan said. “It is going to be really hard to replace them.”
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">That view was echoed by business owners near Discovery’s headquarter.</span> Half a mile up Georgia Avenue at Crisfield Seafood, Bonnie Swanson was tending to the tail end of the lunch crowd at the restaurant her grandparents opened <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1945.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Swanson said the family business survived waves of economic instability in Silver Spring and <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 recession</span>.</span> But Discovery pulling out of Silver Spring was “petrifying.”
Moving forward, Swanson said, the county and state can’t neglect Silver Spring in favor of other development plans, such as those in Bethesda, saying that Silver Spring had long been “Bethesda’s redheaded stepsister.”
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">Facing the loss of lunchtime foot traffic and Discovery employees who host business dinners at Crisfield, Swanson said her restaurant would “just have to buckle our seat belts and hold on.</span> It’s all we can do.”
A few blocks away, Juancarlo Parkhurst still had a few hours before his restaurant, Lina’s Diner and Bar, opened for dinner. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">He’d heard rumors that Discovery might be pulling out of the area for more than a year, but on Tuesday, he was forced to deal with the prospect of losing much of his happy-hour crowd of Discovery employees.
</span>Parkhurst said Discovery was “really big in helping the renaissance of Silver Spring” but also helped drive rent increases that were straining tenants.
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">“Now that there’s no longer this anchor tenant and thousands of employees, it’s very scary as a business operator,” Parkhurst said.
</span>Discovery’s decision dealt a potentially fatal setback to ambitions in the Washington area to become a major player in the entertainment industry.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">Economists said consolidation among media companies has already helped fuel an exodus in the sector.</span> BET Networks, the country’s largest cable network for African American audiences, relocated its headquarters from Northeast Washington to New York last summer. Executives said the move was part of a years-long transition into the Manhattan offices of its parent company, Viacom, which bought BET <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $3 billion</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2000.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">The company had <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 40 full</span>-time employees <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 36 freelancers</span> in Washington.
</span>Silver Spring is still home to Urban One, which <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">operates 55 radio</span> stations targeting African American listeners. But Discovery was the flagship company for this region’s hopes to secure a permanent niche in the industry.
“We have advocacy media and are the information center for political reasons, but not necessarily for documentaries or film entertainment,” Buchanan said.
<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Business leaders said Discovery’s decision highlighted the importance for the Washington region to promote economic sectors where the area already enjoys a competitive advantage and thus has good prospects to succeed.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">Such sectors include cybersecurity, biotechnology, hospitality and financial services, industries with leading companies in the Washington area.</span> A Silver Spring pharmaceutical company, United Therapeutics, has been expanding.
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">The Greater Washington Partnership, an alliance of chief executives of large employers, last month urged greater efforts in the area to train digital technology workers to aid all of those sectors.
</span>“Regions need to focus on their strengths,” said Peter L. Scher, vice chairman of the partnership and chairman of the Mid-Atlantic region for JPMorgan Chase. “What’s important for the region is to keep its eye on the ball. What are the growth sectors, and how do we continue to nurture them?”
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">The need to do more to promote growth separate from the federal government has become acute in recent years because of mandated government budget cuts in the process known as sequestration.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Economic growth has been weak <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010,</span> compared with other big metro areas, as the region struggles to add new, well-paying jobs.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">The jobs it has added — many of them in the service industry — are often low-paid positions with high turnover rates.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">Among the country’<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 15 largest</span> metropolitan areas, the Washington region ranks last in job creation and income growth, according to data from the Stephen S. Fuller Institute at GMU.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">As Discovery showed by shipping low-end jobs to Tennessee, the Washington region struggles to compete when business costs are a factor.
</span>Montgomery and Maryland officials offered undisclosed incentives to Discovery to offset the lower costs in Knoxville, but the gap was too wide to bridge.
<span id=""32"" class=""red"">“There’s no question it’s cheaper to do business in Knoxville,” said Leavy, the Discovery executive.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">“They don’t have a state income tax.</span> Property values are in <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 40 percent</span> <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 50 percent</span> range,” compared with those in Montgomery, he said.
<span id=""34"" class=""red"">Discovery also pointed to other cost advantages in Tennessee.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">According to <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2017 business</span> tax index, it said, Tennessee ranked 13th best while Maryland was 42nd.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Tennessee’s corporate income tax rate <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 6.5 percent</span>, compared with Maryland’<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 8.25 percent</span>.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">According to the Council for Community and Economic Research, the cost of living in Knoxville <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 41 percent</span> below that of Silver Spring, Rockville and Frederick.
</span>Discovery’s move did not come as a surprise to close observers of the company. It has cut its workforce in Silver Spring by nearly half over the past decade. Chief executive David Zaslav, a native New Yorker who took over the company <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007,</span> has been living in Manhattan in recent years even though the company’s headquarters was in Maryland.
“When the new guy came in, there didn’t seem to be any connection between him and the county, between him and Silver Spring,” Duncan, the former county executive, said.
That was in contrast with Discovery’s founder, John Hendricks, who had close relations with Duncan and other local officials. A West Virginia native, Hendricks was running a Maryland consulting firm before he launched Discovery <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1985 with</span> <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $5 million</span> investment from Allen & Co., a boutique New York investment firm known for its media expertise. The timing was right. Cable pioneer John Malone was searching for content for his nascent cable system, and he invested in Discovery and agreed to carry the channel. It hit the airwaves with an after-school special on icebergs.
<span id=""38"" class=""red"">In time, the network was a giant of reality TV, the home of shows such as “19 Kids and Counting,” “The Crocodile Hunter” and “Dirty Jobs.”
</span>Hendricks lured Zaslav, who <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">turns 58 on</span> Monday, from a top post at NBC Universal <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007 to</span> become its chief executive.
“Working with John gave me the fever,” Zaslav said in <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2006 interview</span> with The Washington Post, calling Hendricks “a mentor.”
<span id=""39"" class=""red"">Zaslav overhauled the company, closing its retail stores, ousting veteran executives and reducing the workforce <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 20 percent</span>.</span> He rebranded some of the channel’s properties, making it leaner and more profitable.
“David is a hard-driving guy, direct but likable,” said Hugh Panero, founder and former chief executive at XM Satellite Radio and an adjunct professor at the George Washington University School of Media and Public Affairs. “He came to Discovery when it was down, and he turned it around. He is very focused, smart. He identifies what needs to be fixed . . . sees the pins and knocks them down, pursuing his objectives relentlessly.”
Malone, who sits on the Discovery board, is reportedly a fan.
“Malone does not suffer fools,” said Panero, who has known Zaslav since they worked together in New York media <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">circles 30 years</span> ago. “For Malone, it’s all about what you deliver. He thinks very highly of him.”
Zaslav was well rewarded. <span id=""40"" class=""red"">He is one of the most highly compensated people in the country, <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">earning $341 million</span> in cash, stock and other benefits over company fiscal <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">years 2012 through</span><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> according to Equilar, an executive data firm.</span> Total shareholder return during that period <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 34 percent</span>, according to Equilar.
The news hasn’t all been bad for Montgomery and Maryland. Last year, state and county officials succeeded in keeping Marriott International in Montgomery. <span id=""41"" class=""red"">They <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">offered $62 million</span> in loans, tax credits and grants to build a new headquarters in Bethesda, where the hospitality giant has been based <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 40 years</span>.
</span>Once Discovery leaves, however, Maryland will be the home of only two <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Fortune 500 companies</span></span> other than Marriott: Lockheed Martin and Host Hotels & Resorts.
<span id=""42"" class=""red"">The loss of Discovery “is a real setback, both symbolically and in terms of local employment,” said Anirban Basu, an economist at Baltimore-based Sage Policy Group.</span> “Maryland is not home to many <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Fortune 500 companies</span></span>, and to lose this headquarters represents an unsightly blemish for the state.”

66574421e5b48f8b30994340,58696,"<h3>Amy Klobuchar Talks Health Care, Israel and, Yes, That Comb</h3>There was no real doubt what the first question to Senator Amy Klobuchar would be.
Backstage at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., where Ms. Klobuchar was the first in a series of presidential candidates to be interviewed on Saturday, the interviewer, Kara Swisher, asked: “Do you want to start with the comb or end with the comb?”
“We’re going to start with the comb,” Ms. Swisher, the co-founder of the technology news website Recode and a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, concluded.
“The comb” was a reference to a February New York Times article about how Ms. Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, treats her staff in the Senate. <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2008,</span> The Times reported, an aide bought her a salad in an airport but fumbled the plastic utensils. On the plane, Ms. Klobuchar berated the aide, pulled a comb out of her purse and ate the salad with it.
“It was me sort of doing a mom thing,” Ms. Klobuchar responded at Saturday’s event, co-sponsored by The Texas Tribune. “I didn’t have a fork. I used a comb to eat a salad very briefly on a plane in a MacGyver move.”
The fact that Ms. Klobuchar ate salad with a comb was not the main conclusion of the Times report. She did not mention on Saturday that, after finishing the salad, she handed the comb to the aide and ordered him to clean it.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The article, based on interviews with more than two dozen former aides, also included details about how her Senate office employees who took paid parental leave were expected to stay in their job for three times as many weeks as they had taken off — and that if they didn’t, according to an employee handbook, they would be required to pay back the money earned during their leave.
</span>In response to the article, Ms. Klobuchar’s office said it had never enforced that policy and would change the handbook. She did not address that on Saturday, and Ms. Swisher did not ask.
Ms. Klobuchar, who has previously said she “can be tough on people,” acknowledged — as she has in past responses to reports on her treatment of her staff — that she was “sometimes too tough.” “I can push them too hard,” she said. “I can always do better.”
Ms. Swisher then asked if Ms. Klobuchar felt the coverage of her treatment of staff members was sexist, given that many male politicians act similarly.
“I’m not going to go there,” she said, adding, “Whatever it is, I just can’t waste my time analyzing it, because the stakes are too high, and I care too much. That’s why I announced my candidacy in the middle of a blizzard by the Mississippi River.”
In the rest of the interview, Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Swisher had wide-ranging discussions on health care, technology, foreign policy and other issues. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Ms. Klobuchar expressed support for several policies to lower drug prices, including importing products from Canada (“In Minnesota, we can see Canada from our porch,” she joked); ending the “pay for delay” practice in which big pharmaceutical companies pay manufacturers not to produce generics; and allowing the government to negotiate drug prices with Medicare, a perennial proposal from Democrats.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">She criticized the relatively short sentence given to the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in his financial fraud case this week, citing her experience prosecuting white-collar crime and declaring, “You can’t have two systems of justice, one for the rich and powerful and one for everyone else.”</span> She denounced President Trump for his attacks on the news media, saying he “tweets whatever he wants in the morning but doesn’t respect the amendment that allows him to do it.”
She also said she disagreed with Representative Ilhan Omar’s recent comments about American politicians’ support for Israel, “because I believe you can be true to your country and advocate for another country, whether it is Israel or Canada or Ethiopia” — but condemned Mr. Trump for emboldening intolerance, including anti-Semitism, and noted Ms. Omar’s own background as a refugee.
Asked about a recent proposal by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another presidential candidate, to break up big tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, Ms. Klobuchar refused to commit to it. But she endorsed antitrust action and the breakup of monopolies broadly as “one of the governing principles for ensuring that we have a capitalist system.”
Ms. Warren also appeared at South by Southwest on Saturday, speaking with Anand Giridharadas of Time magazine. Mr. Giridharadas began the interview by telling everyone in the audience who either worked for or hoped to work for one of those tech giants to stand, and then asking Ms. Warren to explain to them why she wanted to break up their companies.
Picking Amazon as her example, Ms. Warren condemned the ability of such giants to, essentially, play on a field they control. Amazon not only runs a marketplace, she said, but uses its vast trove of information about consumers’ behavior in the marketplace to create and promote its own products.
“You can be an umpire — a platform — or you can own teams. That’s fine. But you can’t be an umpire and own one of the teams that’s in the game,” she said. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Break those things apart and we will have a much more competitive, robust market in America.</span> That’s how capitalism should work.”
“The monopolist will make fewer monopoly profits,” she added. “Boo-hoo.”
Pressed on what this outlook said about her philosophical differences with Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running on a democratic socialist platform, Ms. Warren said she wanted capitalism to work better.
“There’s an enormous amount to be gained from markets,” she said. “But markets have to have rules. They have to have a cop on the beat. Markets without rules are theft.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">As in her stump speeches, Ms. Warren also spoke at length about the systemic effects of racism, especially in worsening economic inequality.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">In the 1960s, she noted, when redlining and other forms of housing discrimination were legal, the homeownership gap between black and white Americans <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 27 percentage</span> points.</span> Today, it <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 30 percentage</span> points.

How a Dog’s Killing Turned Brooklyn Progressives Against One Another
After a sudden confrontation that left a golden retriever dead, neighbors came together online to support the owner of the dog. But then things changed.
Supported by
Real-world ethics question: In a well-used city park, a man with a history of erratic behavior attacks a dog and its owner with a stick; five days later, the dog dies. The man is Black, the dog owner white; the adjoining neighborhood is famously progressive, often critical of the police and jail system. At the same time, crime is up in the neighborhood, with attacks by emotionally disturbed people around the city putting some residents on edge.
In a dog-loving, progressive enclave, where pushing law and order can clash with calls for social justice, what’s the right thing to do? How do you protect the public without furthering injustice against this man?
Here’s what happened in Park Slope, Brooklyn, when real-life residents faced this situation.
On Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3,</span> Jessica Chrustic,<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 40,</span> a professional beekeeper, was walking her dog in Prospect Park a little <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 6 a</span>.m. when she saw a man rifling through the garbage outside the Picnic House. She had seen the man before — tall, with dreadlocks wrapped in a turban, carrying a long staff and often muttering to himself or cursing — and she usually kept her distance. But this morning there was no room to avoid him.
According to Ms. Chrustic, he started yelling about immigrants taking over the park, then grabbed a bottle of what she later concluded was urine and sloshed it at her and her dog. She tried to run away, but Moose, her 80-pound golden retriever mix, was straining toward the man, trying to protect her.
The man started swinging the stick, she said. One blow hit her, not seriously. Another connected solidly with the dog’s snout. Mary Rowland,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 56,</span> a hospital manager who was walking her dog nearby, said she heard the crack of wood on bone and came running toward them, screaming at the man to get away.
Both women <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">called 911,</span> and four patrol cars arrived within a few minutes. But by then, the man was gone. “Moose was bleeding from his mouth and pulling to get home,” Ms. Chrustic said. “My focus was just on caring for him.”
Ms. Chrustic was physically unhurt, but she was shaken. How could this happen in a park where she had never felt unsafe, even walking her dog late at night?
Moose had a shattered tooth that needed to be pulled. Ms. Chrustic posted a description of the encounter on the neighborhood social network Nextdoor, warning others about the man and asking them to report any sightings to the police. Her post elicited more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 280 comments</span> in the coming weeks, mostly expressing sympathy. A total stranger on the forum offered to make her a bracelet with the name Moose on it.
But then the next weekend, Moose developed sepsis from a perforated intestine, caused by a blow Ms. Chrustic had not noticed. After emergency surgery, Moose died.
Weeks passed, and the man who attacked the dog was still at large. People on Nextdoor, working from Ms. Chrustic’s description, posted that they had seen him in one part of the park or another. Ms. Chrustic, who used to visit the park four times a day, now found it too traumatic to enter unless necessary.
She was especially frustrated that the man, who was well known to people in the park, had not been arrested. “You have a person who is walking around the park who is violent and needs to be removed,” she said. “He’s known by the community. It’s disheartening.”
It was a random incident that might once have been discussed by a group of dog owners. But now it had a forum for a much wider community, with arguments about policing, vigilantism, homelessness, mental health care and progressive obstinacy all feeding into a conversation that evolved beyond the crime that set it off.
“It’s complicated,” said S. Matthew Liao, a professor of bioethics, philosophy and public health at New York University. “It’s a conflict of values, between wanting security and social justice. Everybody has a responsibility in some ways.
“There are a bunch of issues here, a bunch of threats,” he added. “We can deal with them in a compassionate way, or a not compassionate way.”
The Nextdoor effect
Nextdoor, which claims an average <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 37 million</span> users per week, started <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010 with</span> the promise of connecting people with their neighbors and neighborhoods. One slogan went, “When neighbors start talking, good things happen.”
One thing they talked about, a lot, was local crime. In Nextdoor forums for communities all over the country, this included suspected crime and sightings of “suspicious” characters, leading early critics to say that what the platform really propagated was white fear. After complaints about racial profiling <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016,</span> the company instituted diversity training for its operations staff and new protocols for posts about crime and safety. But even <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020,</span></span> Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez characterized it as an outlet for privileged white people to vent criminal fantasies about their Black and brown neighbors. She tweeted, “@Nextdoor needs to publicly deal w/ their Karen problem.”
A Nextdoor spokesperson said the company enables users to report any posts that they find offensive or discriminatory, which are then reviewed by volunteer community moderators or staff members. <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2021,</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 1 percent</span> of posts were reported as hurtful or harmful; about half of these were removed.
When Ms. Chrustic posted about the attack, the first responses were mostly notes of condolence and support. People with dogs posted that they had seen the man in the same area where she was attacked — why weren’t the police arresting him? Donations poured in to offset her veterinary bills.
But gradually, other voices emerged. A vocal minority asked why Park Slope residents, mostly white, were calling for the police to take down a man who appeared to be homeless and emotionally disturbed. Others called the man a “monster,” a “predator” or a “psychopath.” As on other social media platforms, the most ardent voices made the most noise.
Martin Lofsnes,<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 52,</span> a dancer and choreographer who moved out of the neighborhood <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020,</span></span> came across the conversation while trying to sell some stuff and was appalled by the vitriol directed at an impoverished man, and by what he called “this vigilante attitude.”
He urged people on the thread to put their emotions aside and consider “400 yrs of systematic racism which has prevented black people from building generational wealth through homeownership resulting in the extreme disparity we see today.” Arresting the man, he wrote, would solve none of that.
With all the affluence in Park Slope, he posted, maybe critics should raise money to help the man, not throw him to the lethal jail system, from which he would most likely emerge more dangerous, or not emerge at all.
Others called Mr. Lofsnes naïve or accused him of mansplaining, or told him to take his comments to another thread.
“It’s easy to say that you’re for prison reform and you’re a liberal, until it happens to you,” Mr. Lofsnes said in an interview. “When it happens to you, you have to deal with it. You have to take a step back, even in that heated situation where her dog died, and say, ‘What does this do in the larger scheme of things?’”
To Ms. Chrustic and many on Nextdoor, the issue was simple: A man who killed a dog and attacked its owner was a risk to everyone. She asked people who saw the man to <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">call 911 and</span> to send her photographs so she could confirm that it was really him.
Though most people on the site were supportive, some of the commentary and messages disturbed her. She was accused of not cooperating with the police; some suggested that she did not deserve a dog because she had not protected hers. “People can be horrible,” she said. “And people also take it as an opportunity to vent. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">It becomes a politically divisive conversation I have no interest in being a part of.”
</span>She worked with a police artist to create a sketch of the man, even though part of his face had been covered during the attack. The sketch went up on Nextdoor, and police officers posted it in the park, prompting more reports of sightings.
For Nicole Haddad, who stopped going to the park with her pitbull-vizsla mix, Kingsley, after he was the victim of a similar attack three years ago, Ms. Chrustic’s posts hit home. Since then, Ms. Haddad said, Kingsley has been fearful and sometimes aggressive and has needed expensive behavioral specialists and anti-anxiety medication.
“When I read Jessica’s post, I got really, really triggered,” she said. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">“I just knew the journey that Jessica was going to be in for, because it’s caused me emotional and financial duress.</span> I reached out to her immediately.” The two women compared information and concluded that their dogs were attacked by the same man. To the people who focused more on social justice than removing a threat, Ms. Haddad said: “I tell those people to shut up. They don’t have a leg to stand on.
“I don’t care that it’s being divisive, and that people don’t want to see this guy die in Rikers Island,” Ms. Haddad added. “I’m a New York liberal. I am absolutely for people getting the help they need. But this person is attacking people and killing dogs. He’s targeting women and dogs. He’s violent. He should not be in the park. He should be locked up and paying for his actions.”
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Don’t be a cop, Kris
Kristian Nammack,<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 59,</span> who works in sustainable financing, read the Moose posts on Nextdoor and grew frustrated that nothing seemed to be happening.</span> So he decided to do something about it. He invited people on Nextdoor and Meetup to form a neighborhood watch group to “take our neighborhood back.” As an enticement, he created a logo and <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">printed 10 T</span>-shirts. “We may also get to wear cool berets,” his solicitation offered, nodding to the Guardian Angels, an anti-crime “safety patrol” prominent in the ’70s and ’80s.
Mr. Nammack’s name for the new group: Park Slope Panthers.
He did not see the backlash coming.
“In my mind it was getting people to provide some visibility of community members in the park, especially at hours when women feel vulnerable, <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">like 6 to</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 9,</span>” he said. “Not vigilantes, not with guns, not with the intention to tackle an attacker, but just to be another physical presence. I think just a presence deters crime.”
Mr. Nammack, who was involved in ACT UP and Occupy Sandy, presents himself as a soft-spoken voice of reason, with a Quaker background and a longstanding commitment to progressive causes. He was surprised suddenly to be embraced by people to the right of him. He said he was invited to appear on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” and to meet with Curtis Sliwa, the Guardian Angels founder who ran a tough-on-crime campaign for mayor. Flustered, he declined both.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Then there was the group’s name, which was an immediate flash point: a white financial services guy using the Panther name to take action against a Black man.</span> At the group’s first and only meeting, the scattering of potential volunteers was met by a group of four people, all white, who showed up to disrupt the proceedings.
As described in the news site Hell Gate and the newsletter Common Sense, things went awry almost from the start. A man calling himself Snow told the group, “We are super not into you guys having your meeting, or doing anything in the park,” according to Hell Gate. “The opposite of what we need right now is more cops in this park and more people who want to be helping the cops in this park, when people are already being, like, chased down by the cops.”
To the delight of people who enjoy making fun of Park Slope liberals, one of the disrupters, a woman calling herself Sky, said, “Crime is an abstract term that means nothing in a lot of ways,” according to Common Sense.
A few days after the meeting, someone spray-painted the sidewalk outside Mr. Nammack’s apartment: “Don’t Be a Cop, Kris.” It rattled him. “Even being gay, I don’t know that I’ve ever been the target of hate,” he said. “I felt that I was the target of hate.” He decided he did not have the time or energy to continue the group.
On Nextdoor, people seemed to be dug into their positions. Many bundled the lack of an arrest with the rise of other crimes in the neighborhood. Serious crimes in the 78th Precinct, which includes Park Slope, are <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 50 percent</span> from two years ago, though well below the highs of the early 1990s.
A spokesperson for the Police Department said they were conducting canvasses of the park but would not comment on why there had been no arrest. At a virtual town meeting, Capt. Frantz Souffrant noted that numerous people in the area wear dreadlocks and carry staves. Ms. Rowland — the woman who witnessed the assault — went on at least three rides with officers to confirm a sighting. Each time the person was gone, or it was the wrong man.
Both Ms. Chrustic and Mr. Nammack separately appealed to their representative on the City Council, Shahana Hanif, for help, but they came away feeling her staff members were more concerned with the safety of the man — whom they presumed to be homeless and mentally ill — than with the threat he might pose to others.
Mr. Nammack said he was told: “‘We don’t want the police involved in this.’” He said, “They didn’t seem concerned that there was a public safety threat with this man at large, and that he needs to be dealt with. The bigger concern was keeping this man out of Rikers, and let’s not do anything.”
Under New York law, depending on the level of cruelty, killing a dog can be a misdemeanor or a felony, carrying a prison sentence of up to two years. Michael Whitesides, a spokesperson for Ms. Hanif, called the situation complicated. “We don’t believe that the N.Y.P.D. is the vehicle to bring safety to our community,” Mx. Whitesides said. “When it comes to this individual, they’re clearly a present danger to others and most likely themselves, and figuring out how we can safely de-escalate that situation without putting anyone else in danger is complicated.”
The debate, Mx. Whitesides said, was simply what happens when progressive priorities clash. “Even among the progressives, everyone wants to be safe,” they said. “These debates in the community, while they can feel very tense — this is how we find a solution. It’s going to come through neighbors talking to neighbors.”
Can you support social justice and the police?
On a recent afternoon, nearly two months after the attack, the park was a 526-acre sanctuary from social media and liberal hand-wringing, its tree-lined paths and open fields indifferent to the disputations among its users. Schoolchildren, let out into the exquisite early fall afternoon, fanned excitedly over the gently sloping lawn, as a police cruiser idled nearby, its misery lights flashing. The park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who designed Central Park, both connects and separates the disparate neighborhoods around it.
Ms. Chrustic was willing to talk on a bench outside the park, but not to enter within. Like Mr. Nammack, she felt compelled to stress her progressive bona fides, including volunteer work she’d done for homeless organizations. She wore the M-O-O-S-E bracelet given to her through Nextdoor. “And I don’t even wear bracelets usually,” she said.
She said she still had not moved Moose’s bed or food bowls in her apartment.
“I’m very empathetic toward people who are unhoused and are having hard times and who have mental illness,” she said. “I think that there should be more resources for them. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">There should be more housing situations.</span> But what I emphasize is that this is just one person who needs to be removed from the park. He’s violent. End of story.”
For two months, she has grown increasingly impatient with the police, local officials and neighbors on Nextdoor who seemed more concerned about her attacker’s welfare than her safety.
“Are they waiting for somebody to die?” she said. “Are they waiting for someone to get hurt more severely? I was lucky. My dog was not. What happens to the next person? What happens if it’s a child? How many more people need to be harmed?”
Mr. Nammack, for his part, had come to see his failed effort to start a community watch group, and the disastrous meetup, as a successful exercise in democracy. He had solicited a range of viewpoints, and he got them. “The Saturday meeting, looking back, it was great,” he said. “It brought up a lot of issues. It was quite diverse. It left more open questions than answers. They’re all good questions, but I don’t have the bandwidth to answer. So I feel like I opened a can of worms, and I’m walking away from it.”
For now, he was urging people to sign a petition on Change.org, demanding that Mayor Eric Adams “take appropriate action to rectify this matter.” More <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 600 people</span> have signed the petition.
But Mr. Nammack was not done. After a brief ban from Nextdoor, which was never explained, he returned to the fray. Once again he posted the police sketch of Ms. Chrustic’s attacker, above the headline: STILL AT LARGE. PROSPECT PARK VAGRANT. VIOLENT AND SOCIOPATHIC.
Twenty-seven people clicked that they liked the post. Then Mr. Nammack’s posts were removed again.

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 12,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014 12</span>:59 pm ET

NORFOLK, Va.—With J.C. Penney Co. and Sears Holdings Corp. racing to close stores, America's weakest malls are being pushed to the brink.

Nearly half of <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1,050 indoor</span> and open air malls in the U.S. have both of those struggling chains as anchor tenants, according to real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Of those malls, nearly a quarter are struggling with sales <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $300 per</span> square foot and vacancy rates <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 20%,</span> meaning they will have a hard time finding new tenants if old ones leave.

</span>For an already-weakened mall industry, the negative turn for two once-reliable anchors is promising more stress at a time when the Internet is steadily stealing traffic. And the pressure is only growing. Sears Chief Executive Eddie Lampert this week said he plans to close more stores to help return the company to profitability.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Vacancy rates rose and sales plunged at the Gallery at Military Circle, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 5 miles</span> from downtown Norfolk, Va., after the Sears store closed its doors two years ago.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Eventually the mall's owner missed multiple payments on its debt.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Remaining retail tenants worry about what will happen when the Penney store closes this month, darkening another corner of the 44-year-old property.

</span>Bruce Van, who manages Gent's, a locally owned boutique specializing in men's suits and fedoras and Sunday church clothes, said foot traffic fell by more than half after the Sears closed.

""When J.C. Penney goes out in May, it's going to be bad,"" said Mr. Van, who is also pastor at Rivers of Life Fellowship in Hampton, Va.

The first U.S. indoor mall opened in Edina, Minn., <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1956,</span> and construction peaked in the 1980s. Only six new malls have been built <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010,</span> according to CoStar Group, a provider of commercial real-estate information. Meanwhile, the number of ""dead malls,"" those with vacancy rates <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 40%,</span> has nearly tripled <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2006 to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 74 properties</span>.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The fate of the mall business matters, because even as the industry struggles, it remains an important source of economic activity.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Sales per square foot at the nation's malls grew <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 2.6% last</span> year—their slowest pace <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2009,</span> according to International Council of Shopping Centers.</span> Vacancy rates are stubbornly high, at an average of more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 8% at</span> regional malls, not far off <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2011 peak</span> in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 9.4%,</span> according to data company Reis Inc.

""Just because people are making fewer trips to the mall doesn't mean they're spending less,"" said Jesse Tron, a spokesman for the ICSC. Mr. Tron said that malls are trying to reinvent themselves by adding entertainment like indoor golf courses and higher-end restaurants, as well as services such as same-day delivery.

Still, it is tough to reverse such high vacancy rates when large anchor-tenant retailers like Sears and Penney are closing stores and others like Macy's Inc. are opening fewer locations.

Penney, which racked <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up $2.4 billion</span> in losses over the past two years, plans to <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">close 33 of</span> its stores, most of them in malls. Sears, with losses <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $2.3 billion</span> over the same period, has <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">closed 116 of</span> its full-line Sears stores <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010.</span> Penney and Sears declined to comment.

To be sure, the exit of a troubled retailer can create an opportunity for stronger malls to find healthier tenants. But it is a different situation for struggling malls. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">And the potential damage from losing an anchor tenant is especially high in malls that have both Penney and Sears as tenants, said Gary Balter, a retail analyst with Credit Suisse.</span> ""If one of them goes, it almost forces the other one out, because the mall just won't get enough traffic,"" Mr. Balter said.

The exit of an anchor can cause other stores to leave or renegotiate their leases, contributing to a spiral of declining traffic and investment.

At the Gallery at Military Circle, the cavernous,<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 128,000</span>-square-foot space once occupied by Sears remains empty. ""For Lease"" posters dot the windows of other darkened storefronts.

The mall's situation is already tenuous. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">In November, and again in February and April, Thor Equities LLC, its owner, missed payments on <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $53 million</span> securitized loan, and Thor is in talks to restructure the debt, according to Trepp LLC, a company that collects data on real-estate debt.

</span>The Gallery is hanging on to its other anchors—Macy's at the north end and an 18-screen Cinemark Holdings Inc. movie theater on the south. A Macy's spokesman said the retailer has no plans to leave. Cinemark didn't return calls seeking comment.

At the Southlake Mall in Morrow, Ga., after the Penney there closed in <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2011,</span> a number of national-chain tenants had their rent payments reduced, real-estate executives said. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The mall's total sales fell <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $58 million</span> in January <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $60 million</span> in the year Penney closed as vacancies rose.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Several retailers at the mall said their sales have fallen <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 30% since</span> Penney left.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">""J.C. Penney brought people to the mall,"" said Joseph Nguyen, who operates a jewelry-repair kiosk near the food court and was one of the retailers whose sales fell off.

</span>Southlake occupied what was considered prime real estate in suburban Clayton County when the property was built just off <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Interstate 75 in</span><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1976.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Housing developments were springing up as the city expanded southward, bringing in new residents and eager shoppers.

</span>Over the past decade, however, Southlake's fortunes have turned. Newer shopping destinations in neighboring Henry County pulled customers away. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Clayton County lost jobs when a nearby Ford Motor Co. plant closed <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006.</span></span> The mall took a further hit when Clayton County dropped bus service two years ago.

Southlake lost its first anchor <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003,</span> when Macy's closed one of its two stores at the mall. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Unable to find another retail tenant, General Growth Properties, which bought the mall <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1997,</span> turned the space into offices and a convention center.</span> General Growth filed for <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Chapter 11 bankruptcy</span> protection <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009 and</span> emerged <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span> A year later, Penney left Southlake mall.

While the mall's occupancy rate has remained <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 90%,</span> Southlake has lost several national players, including The Limited and Gap clothing chains and the Chick-fil-A fast-food restaurant.

""Two anchors aren't enough to draw people to the mall,"" said Michelle Laidig, who has worked at Southlake <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 25 years</span>. ""The mall used to be a destination. Now the locals just come here to return items they bought at other malls.""

The future may be turning around. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Vintage Real Estate LLC, which acquires and redevelops underperforming malls, bought Southlake in April for an undisclosed price and plans to <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">invest $3 million</span> to revitalize the property.

</span>""We talked to every tenant,"" Vintage Chairman Fred Sands said. ""We found out how they are doing and what the facility needs.""

Mr. Sands said he is negotiating with new restaurants for the food court and is interviewing tenants to take over the former Penney space.

The chairman disputes the idea that the mall was hurt by Penney's closing. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Sales excluding newly opened or closed stores have held steady at <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $320 per</span> square foot <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2011,</span> according to documents Mr. Sands provided.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Lost business from Penney was offset by increased sales from the mall'<span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 16 shoe</span> retailers, including Foot Locker and Athlete's Foot, he said.

</span>RaeQuel Fagin, a 20-year-old-restaurant worker who met a friend at the food court on a recent Tuesday afternoon, said the mall was a good place to come for sneaker releases, but not for much else.

""I wouldn't say this is where I would come if I felt like shopping,"" Ms. Fagin said.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The theft offers another example of the vulnerability facing cryptocurrencies and the venues where investors trade them.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Yet the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies barely budged after the robbery was disclosed Wednesday morning in Asia.

</span>Binance said it discovered Tuesday <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 7,000 bitcoins</span> were stolen from a single wallet, amounting to <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 2% of</span> the company’s total bitcoin holdings.

Hackers used phishing, viruses and other techniques, the company said. Binance said they had obtained information about multiple users, including two-factor authentication codes. Industry participants said they believed it was the first major breach at Binance.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Binance, which was founded in China but now operates outside the country, said it was suspending deposits and withdrawals for one week while it conducts a security review, although users will still be able to trade existing funds.</span> Stolen funds would be refunded through its emergency insurance account, the company said.

“The hackers had the patience to wait, and execute well-orchestrated actions through multiple seemingly independent accounts at the most opportune time,” Binance said. “The transaction is structured in a way that [it] passed our existing security checks. It was unfortunate that we were not able to block this withdrawal before it was executed.”

In a video posted on Twitter following the disclosed hack, Changpeng Zhao, chief executive at Binance, described the incident as “a very advanced, persistent hacking effort.” <span id=""4"" class=""red"">He said trading might need to be halted “for a couple of hours here and there” due to system upgrades.

</span>He said Binance has the funds to back the stolen amount. “It does hurt very much but we are able to cover that,” he said in the video. “We are not short on funds right now,” he added.

Hacks were a primary reason for bitcoin’s steep fall last year following its manic rally <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">While bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, is up more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 50% so</span> far this year, it remains down by <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 70% from</span> its record high in <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2017.</span>

</span>“People are quite used to exchange hacks,” said John Patrick Mullin, a cryptocurrency investor and blockchain consultant in Hong Kong. “Markets didn’t move nearly as much as they would’ve one year ago if the same thing happened.”

Bitcoin recently traded <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $5,800,</span> according to CoinDesk.

Cryptocurrency exchanges and investors are often targeted by hackers. More <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1.7 billion</span> has been publicly reported stolen over the years, mostly from exchanges in Asia, including Japanese platforms Mt. Gox and Coincheck.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Last month, the New York attorney general’s office said an exchange called Bitfinex had covered up a loss <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $850 million</span> of corporate and customer funds by using the reserves of the digital currency it controls, tether.

</span>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies exist on independent networks and operate on the blockchain, a public record of transactions. In an effort to replicate the anonymity of physical cash, those transactions aren’t connected to an identity. The anonymity is appealing to bitcoin proponents but is also attractive to hackers and makes it tough to catch thieves.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">“Hacking risks are part of the business reality for crypto exchanges,” said Henri Arslanian, global crypto leader at PwC. “While crypto exchanges are becoming increasingly better prepared, hackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated as well.”

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 26,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 12</span>:31 pm ET

Anheuser-Busch InBev NV still has a way to go in its quest to woo increasingly fickle American drinkers.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The brewer behind Budweiser and Bud Light on Thursday said U.S. revenue <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 3.1% in</span> the second quarter on the back of lower volumes, as both brands continued to lose market share.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The weak performance was a factor in the company missing overall sales growth forecasts, prompting shares to drop more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 5%.</span>

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Sales of the two brands have fallen as once-loyal American consumers shift away from domestic lagers toward craft beers, Mexican imports, wine and spirits.

</span>In response, the company is trying to persuade consumers to buy more expensive beers, rolling out Michelob Ultra Pure Gold, made with organic grains, and Bud Light Orange, brewed with citrus peels. It also plans to launch pricier variants of Budweiser, including a beer aged on bourbon barrel staves, due to begin selling next month.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">On Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Felipe Dutra said there was “no silver bullet, no short term answer to some of the problems we face,” in the U.S., although he added the company’s efforts to innovate and go upmarket were bearing fruit.

</span>AB InBev pointed to some signs of improvement, noting quarterly share losses in the U.S. had slowed, with <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.35 percentage</span> point drop in the last quarter its best quarterly performance in almost four years. It said Michelob Ultra—marketed as a beer for people with an active lifestyle—continued to perform well.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Overall, AB InBev reported a jump in net profit <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1.94 billion</span> for the three months to <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 30,</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $1.5 billion</span> a year earlier, as lower costs helped offset <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1.2% fall</span> in revenue <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $14.01 billion</span>.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Stripping out currency changes and acquisitions, sales <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">grew 4.7%,</span> missing analyst estimates for growth <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 5.4%.</span></span> Shares <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 4.2% in</span> Brussels following the results.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">While some multinationals have said tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are pushing up costs, Mr. Dutra said AB InBev’s costs haven’t risen yet as the company is still protected by hedges.</span> It will begin to feel the impact from these next year.

Outside of the U.S., results were buoyed by Brazil, Mexico, China and Western Europe, helped by the soccer World Cup in Russia, and AB InBev’s efforts to sell pricier drinks.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The World Cup didn’t help sales in the U.S., where viewership was lower than for past tournaments as a result of the American team’s failure to qualify.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">AB InBev said its sponsorship of the soccer tournament was an opportunity to boost sales of Budweiser in international markets as revenue for the beer outside of the U.S. was up by more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10%.</span>

</span>Volume growth in Brazil was slightly hampered by a truck strike, offsetting gains from the World Cup.

The company also announced some organizational changes to spur growth.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">It will combine ZX Ventures, a unit founded <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 to</span> develop new products for emerging consumer needs, with its marketing arm.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The innovation unit in April bought a U.K.-based spirits, e-commerce and import business.

</span>“In order to continue to grow, we have anticipate the future,” said Chief Executive Carlos Brito on a call with investors. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Bringing the two units together “will help us achieve our objective of anticipating market and consumers trends,” he added.

</span>AB InBev is also creating a new position: a head of nonalcoholic beverages. Millennials and so-called “Generation Z” are drinking less than older generations, spurring booze makers to launch more low-alcohol and nonalcoholic products.

Nonalcoholic drinks—which mostly include energy drinks and nonalcoholic beers—make up more <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10% of</span> AB InBev’s volumes.

The company is also restructuring its management, collapsing nine geographical divisions into six in a move it said would help it become more agile following its integration of SABMiller, the London-based brewing giant it acquired <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span>

We can definitely see some advantages. A quick programming note: The <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Health 202 is</span> publishing three days this week. But we’ll be back to our regular schedule next week — see you Monday!

Today’s edition: Nearly half of adults give the U.S. health system a poor or failing grade, per a new report. Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) is rolling out a new campaign critical of drug middlemen. But first ...

Abortion access is at stake in GOP-run states that could elect Democratic governors

The future of abortion access in a handful of battleground states may rest with who wins the governor’s mansion in November.

Democrats are leaning into that message on the campaign trail, seeking to make the November elections a referendum on what they describe as the Republican Party’s extreme position on abortion. This dynamic is playing out in gubernatorial contests in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona — all of which have GOP-controlled state legislatures.

“The landscape changes from state to state, but our message has stayed focused on making sure voters know what a Republican can do to either chip away at current rights or advance existing restrictions,” said Christina Amestoy, a spokesperson for the Democratic Governors Association.

The notion of abortion access changing by the party in power is driving increased attention to statewide races up and down the ballot, even as control of Congress hangs in the balance of this year’s midterm elections. Meanwhile, GOP officials believe the party has a chance to make inroads with late-deciding voters, particularly as the months pass since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, our colleague Annie Linskey reported yesterday.

What the Michigan midterms mean for the future of abortion

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and activists explain <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Proposal 3,</span> a midterm ballot measure which would enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution. (Video: Hannah Jewell, Lindsey Sitz, Ross Godwin/The Washington Post, Photo: Emily Elconin/The Washington Post)

The landscape: The midterms are less than five weeks away. Voters <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 36 states</span> will choose their governor — <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 20 Republicans</span> <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 16 Democrats</span> holding offices that will be up for election this year.

Groups on both sides of the abortion debate — such as NARAL Pro-Choice America and SBA Pro-Life America — are pouring their resources into governor’s races.

Here are the key contests we’re watching:

Wisconsin: Gov. Tony Evers (D) is in a competitive race against Republican nominee Tim Michels. The state has a pre-Roe ban on the books, which Evers filed a lawsuit to repeal and the state’s Democratic attorney general has said he won’t enforce. However, clinics halted all abortion procedures shortly after the Supreme Court’s ruling.

Michigan: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) is running against Republican challenger Tudor Dixon. Abortion in the state is legal after a state judge invalidated a pre-Roe ban on the procedure. Whitmer has asked the state Supreme Court to strike down the ban as well.

But even if Dixon wins, a Republican-controlled legislature could have a hard time enacting bans on the procedure. That’s because voters will decide whether to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution this November.

Arizona: Katie Hobbs (D) and Kari Lake (R) are fighting to fill this open seat. Earlier this year, Gov. Doug Ducey (R) — who is term-limited — signed legislation banning abortion <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 15 weeks</span>. However, an Arizona judge revived a near-total ban on abortion dating back to the mid-19th century a day before the 15-week limit was set to go into effect.

Pennsylvania: This is another contest with no incumbent. State Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D) and state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R) are fighting to succeed the state’s Democratic governor. Abortions are still legal in the state, but that could change if Mastriano wins and the GOP-controlled legislature sends restrictions on the procedure to his desk.

Georgia: This gubernatorial battle is a redo <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2018.</span> Gov. Brian Kemp (R) is again facing Democrat Stacey Abrams, who has made abortion rights a centerpiece of her campaign. The state has a ban on abortion after fetal cardiac activity, which is at roughly six weeks.

Democrats are working to keep the midterms focused on abortion, believing the issue is a powerful motivator to drive voters to the ballot box. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">However, those efforts are colliding with increased Republican efforts to focus on crime and the economy.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Nationally, recent Google News searches for inflation have been about even with inquiries on abortion.</span> This is the case for battleground states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Georgia, Annie reports.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">* “The moderate and independent voters needed to build winning coalitions in competitive governors races are worried about the economy, crime, and education,” Joanna Rodriguez, a Republican Governors Association spokesperson, said in a statement to The <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Health 202.</span></span></span> The focus on abortion shows to those voters that Democrats “not only don't care about their greatest concerns, but also that they have no plans to address them,” Rodriguez said.,

Here's one interesting figure: Democrats in local, statewide and congressional races across the country have vastly outspent Republicans on advertising on abortion. Since Jan.<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> Democrats have spent <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $236 million</span>. Meanwhile, Republicans have spent <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $62 million</span>, according to AdImpact, which tracks commercials. (h/t Azi Paybarah, who crunched the numbers for us.)

Meanwhile,<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 66 clinics</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">across 15 states</span> have stopped offering abortions, according to a report out today from the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research center that supports abortion rights. <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Roughly 40 are</span> offering services other than abortion, <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">while 26 have</span> shut down. Before the Supreme Court's ruling, those states had a total <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 79 clinics</span> providing abortions. <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 13 that</span> are still performing the procedure are located in Georgia, where there's a ban after fetal cardiac activity is detected.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Biden administration’s Project Covid Shield hits a snag

The Biden administration’s plan to create a new accelerator for coronavirus vaccines and treatments has hit a standstill, complicated by fading interest among the public and lawmakers alike to continue treating the pandemic as a priority, Politico reports.

</span>Now, senior health officials are raising alarm bells about the nation’s defenses against the rapidly evolving virus without a long-term operation to ensure that its arsenal of tools stay up-to-date with the latest variants.

Key context: The initiative, dubbed Project Covid Shield, was intended to serve as a follow up to Operation Warp Speed, a Trump-era program that doled out federal dollars to private drugmakers to speed up the production of coronavirus vaccines. Officials had hoped to replicate the approach with new candidates to continue developing increasingly advanced shots and therapeutics to fight the virus — all while maintaining the nation’s edge in the global war against covid-19, Politico’s Adam Cancryn and Erin Banco write.

The White House has yet to secure <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $8 billion</span> from Congress it says it needs to get Project Covid Shield off the ground due to a stalemate with Republicans over new coronavirus aid. Meanwhile, even GOP lawmakers open to the concept have categorized the administration’s effort to date as disorganized and vague.

Americans give failing marks to U.S. health-care system

New this a.m.: Nearly half of adults give the country’s health care system a poor or failing grade, according to a new West Health-Gallup poll, which found that Americans across party lines see lobbying and partisan politics as major barriers to finding solutions to address the rising costs of medicine.

By the numbers:

* Sixty-six percent of Americans report their household pays too much relative to the quality of care that it receives, up six points compared with April of last year, according to the poll, which surveyed more <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 5,5000 adults</span>., * <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Six <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 10 Americans</span> report that cost is an important factor when considering a recommended medical procedure or medication., *</span> Half the country — an <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 129 million</span> adults — have low levels of confidence that they can afford health care as they age., * Two in three Americans <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 65 believe</span> Medicare will not exist when they reach the age of eligibility.,

First in The Health 202: Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), a pharmacist, is rolling out a campaign attacking pharmacy benefit managers often known as drug middlemen. In a new 20-page pamphlet, Carter alleges that PBMs use “various tactics to limit patient medication and increase drug costs” and includes interviews with patients.

It’s another salvo in the drug-pricing wars, where PBMs and other industry players spar over who’s driving up the costs. Carter points to various pieces of legislation he wants to see passed, such as a bill he introduced that would ban the use of spread pricing in Medicaid managed care. Spread pricing is when PBMs charge payers more than they pay to the pharmacy and keep the difference.

PBMs hit back. “Americans consistently reject the use of blame game tactics, especially when real patients’ health and lives are at stake,” JC Scott, the president of Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, said in a statement to The <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Health 202.</span></span> “This is especially true when it comes to blaming PBMs, the one entity reducing costs in the health care system,” Scott said.

* The anonymous woman who accused Herschel Walker of urging her to have an abortion and paying for the procedure revealed that she is the mother of one of his children, after Walker claimed he had no clue about her identity, the Daily Beast reports., * A 14-year-old Arizona patient was initially denied her rheumatoid arthritis medication after the state’s abortion ban took effect last month because the drug can also be used to terminate pregnancies, our colleague María Luisa Paúl writes., * Public health officials are warning Florida’s contaminated waterways following Hurricane Ian could pose a short-term risk to people’s health if they’re exposed, The Post’s Kasha Patel reports., * The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is seeking public input as it develops a National Directory of Healthcare Providers and Services, which is meant to serve as a centralized hub for medical workers’ and facilities’ directory information.,

The outcome is a bonanza for Disney: <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Even as the company limits the number of visitors and keeps attendance at its U.S. theme parks below prepandemic levels, they are generating record sales and profits.

</span>The results reflect a major strategic shift on Disney’s part, where the company is focused less on maximizing the quantity of visitors and more on increasing how much money each visitor spends, an approach the company refers to as yield management. Improving the visitor experience, the thinking goes, will prompt guests to spend more hours—and therefore more money—at the parks because they are having such a good time.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The biggest change in the past two years—and the most lucrative for Disney—is the introduction of a smartphone-app feature called Genie+ that <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">costs $15 per</span> person a day, on top of the price of admission, and allows parkgoers to skip the unreserved lines for some attractions, which the company refers to as “standby.”</span> But Genie+ doesn’t cover everything. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">To skip the standby lines at the most sought-after attractions, including some Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy-themed rides, reservations now cost an <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $10 to</span><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $17.</span></span> Standby waits for popular attractions can last hours.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">At the same time, many benefits that used to be free—from parking for certain annual passholders to airport shuttles to MagicBand wristbands that serve as combination hotel-room keys and park passes—have been eliminated or now come with a price.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Disney has raised prices on hotel rooms, food and merchandise over the past year as inflation has climbed to record levels in the U.S.

Disney’s theme-park pricing is determined by “pure supply and demand,” said a company spokeswoman.</span> “No different than airplanes, hotels or cruise ships.”

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">In the quarter that ended Jan.<span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> Disney’s domestic parks set records in both quarterly revenue and operating income, then broke both of them six months later.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">For the quarter that ended <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2,</span> the business unit that includes the theme parks also posted record revenue <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $5.42 billion</span> and record operating income <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.65 billion</span>.

Josh D’Amaro, the chairman of Disney’s parks, experiences and products division, said that the changes have given visitors more choice about how to spend their time and money at the parks, while at the same time making the parks “extremely commercially successful.”

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">In <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fiscal 2021,</span> the first year that both of Disney’s two main U.S. resorts had reopened following the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, attendance at Disney’s U.S. parks fell <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 17% compared</span> with the previous year, the company reported, but per-capita spending by guests grew <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 17%,</span> or nearly three times the average annual growth rate during the previous decade.</span> Disney doesn’t disclose attendance for its theme parks.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">At the same time, the changes driving the increases in revenue and profit have drawn the ire of what Disney calls “legacy fans,” or longtime parks loyalists, including annual passholders who feel they are being pushed to the side in favor of big-spending families taking once-a-year, or even a once-in-a-lifetime, vacations.

</span>“Disney has this love-hate relationship with annual passholders,” said Len Testa, a computer scientist who runs Touring Plans, a travel company that offers apps to help visitors find deals and navigate their trips to Walt Disney World and publishes a popular guide to Disney theme parks.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">On one hand, they provide a reliable source of revenue—the investment bank UBS estimated early last year that annual passholders at Disneyland account for about one half of annual visits—but on the other, annual passholders tend to spend less than other visitors per visit, Mr. Testa said.

</span>A typical annual pass holder might ride only one ride during a visit, eat an ice cream cone and walk around for a few hours, taking up capacity that might otherwise be used by out-of-state visitors, Mr. Testa said.

“Those people would have stayed all day,” he said. “They would have eaten multiple times in the restaurants, they may have stayed in the hotel. They would definitely be buying more merchandise.”

Since its introduction in the fall <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2021,</span> Genie+ has become an increasingly popular tool. About half of visitors to the parks pay for and use Genie+, Disney said in a recent conference call with Wall Street analysts. And of those who pay for Genie+,<span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 70% say</span> in post-visit surveys that they plan to do so again, Disney says.

Disney has stopped selling nearly all new annual passes to Disneyland and Walt Disney World and has done away with a host of free perks that annual passholders used to enjoy. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Existing annual passholders can renew their passes, although earlier this month, the company raised the renewal price for its highest-tier annual passes to Disneyland <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 14%,</span> <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1,599 from</span><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $1,399,</span> while at the same time introducing more blackout days when passholders can’t visit, angering some of the park’s most ardent fans.

</span>The parks have grown considerably since Walt Disney World opened <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1971.</span> Over the past decade, Disney has added rides based on popular franchises such as Star Wars, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Toy Story films and <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2009 film</span> “Avatar.” A roller coaster at Magic Kingdom based on the Tron films is under construction.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The parks business has buoyed Disney’s stock price and boosted financial results at a time when the company is losing billions on other businesses, like the popular but cost-heavy Disney+ streaming service.

</span>Mr. D’Amaro, the parks chief, is a 24-year veteran of the company who ran both Disneyland and Walt Disney World individually in previous roles.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">He keeps a high profile with fans and employees, making frequent appearances at the parks outside of major events and posting about his visits on social media.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">By contrast, his predecessor, Bob Chapek, who is now Disney’s chief executive, walked the park grounds less frequently and wasn’t as outgoing with visitors, according to Disney employees who worked under him.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">On a recent, hourlong walk through Disneyland, Mr. D’Amaro was stopped more <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20 times</span> by visitors and cast members—as Disney employees are known in company lingo—who asked to take selfies with him and thanked him for his work.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Mr. D’Amaro <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has 144,000 followers</span> on Instagram, where he posts pictures of himself inside the parks alongside costumed employees, riding roller coasters, brandishing lightsabers and eating soft-serve.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Mr. D’Amaro said he’s aware of the tension caused by rising prices and other changes, especially for annual passholders, but describes it as the inevitable result of progress, and insists that every change Disney has implemented at the parks is in service of improving visitors’ trips.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Other top Disney executives say the company is merely reacting to consumer behavior.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">“Demand has not abated” at the parks, Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy told analysts in a conference call in August, explaining why the company wasn’t considering opening up the parks to more days for annual passholders.</span> The new reservation system has allowed the company to limit attendance without having to turn visitors away when the parks become overcrowded, as it occasionally did in previous years.

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">The company also points out that it offers frequent promotions, including discounted room rates at its hotels, packages that become more economical the more days a visitor spends at the park, and discounts for residents of Southern California and Florida.

</span>Other theme-park operators are also reaping the benefits of increased guest spending. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Six Flags Entertainment Corp. and Cedar Fair LP, which operates Cedar Point in Ohio and Knott’s Berry Farm in California, have both raised prices, while SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. implemented <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 5% surcharge</span> on food and beverages.

</span>Sara Suvada, a Starbucks shift supervisor and barista from Auburn Hills, Mich., took her first trip to Walt Disney World in January, at the age <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 42,</span> along with her husband and 6-year-old daughter. She said the trip was the fulfillment of a fantasy from her childhood, when money was tight in her family.

The family spent <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $5,000</span>—most of it paid for by Ms. Suvada’s in-laws—on admission, meals and lodging at Disney’s Saratoga Springs Resort. Ms. Suvada spent <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $400 on</span> souvenirs and concessions, while her husband told her he nearly maxed out his credit card on trinkets and snacks.

<span id=""25"" class=""red"">The memories made up for the price tag, though, she said.</span> She cried when she saw Cinderella Castle for the first time. Her daughter loved riding the Space Mountain roller coaster and meeting her favorite princess, Tiana, from 2009’s “The Princess and the Frog.” And the family savored tasting their first Dole Whip frozen treat. Ms. Suvada is already thinking about returning with her mother.

“The memories are worth more than gold,” she said. “Even if I did suffer from overdraft fees once I got home, when the reality set in.”

Some longtime fans who come to the park regularly, and aren’t splurging on once-in-a-lifetime memories, complain about the new fees.

“I just really resent the nickel-and-diming,” said David Arone, a 50-year-old gym teacher and volleyball coach from Redondo Beach, Calif. Mr. Arone has been a Disneyland annual pass holder for five years, and says he visits the park more <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 times</span> a year, primarily because it reminds him of his best childhood friend, a Disney superfan who died of a heart attack <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013.</span></span>

“I know it sounds hokey, but every time I go, I feel like he’s there with me,” Mr. Arone said of his friend. Most visits, he doesn’t ride any attractions at all. Instead, he just walks around for a few hours, eats ice cream, watches fireworks and reminisces about visiting the park with his late friend.

But he chafes at recent changes. Previously, he could stop by Disneyland for a few hours after work any day he wanted. Now he can’t go on the growing number of blackout days for annual passholders.

<span id=""26"" class=""red"">On a recent visit, Mr. Arone sported a homemade T-shirt with the words “Chapek Killed The Magic” on it — a reference to Mr. Chapek, the CEO, who he blames for rising prices and other changes.

</span>The company said annual passholders like Mr. Arone “are amongst our most special guests.”

<span id=""27"" class=""red"">This month, the company reported that ticket-price increases were offset by an “unfavorable attendance mix” at Disneyland, which many fans interpreted as a reference to annual passholders who typically spend less per visit than individual ticket-buyers.</span> Fans recently started posting pictures of themselves at the parks on social media, wearing T-shirts reading “Unfavorable” in protest.

<span id=""28"" class=""red"">Disney said that “unfavorable mix” is financial parlance meant for investors, and “not a consumer term.”

</span><span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2021,</span> a Disneyland annual pass holder sued Disney, alleging that the company engaged in deceptive practices by artificially limiting how many of them could visit the park on certain days. In May, a U.S. District Court judge in California ruled that the suit could go forward. The plaintiff has said she is seeking class-action certification.

<span id=""29"" class=""red"">Even some customers who come on special annual visits say they are getting fed up with rising prices.

</span>Renea Warren has made the pilgrimage to Walt Disney World nearly every year <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2001.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">But after tallying up the costs of this year’s vacation, the retail executive and mother of one said she has had enough.

</span>On a nine-day family trip to Florida in late July with her mother and daughter, Ms. Warren tried to save money by spending just two days at Disney theme parks, instead of the usual four. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Despite the family’s efforts, visits to Magic Kingdom and Epcot blew up their budget.</span> Park passes set them back more than $800; food was about $200; and they <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped $300 on</span> souvenirs.

Since Ms. Warren, who lives in Benton Harbor, Mich., owns a timeshare <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 minutes</span>’ drive from Walt Disney World, her family will likely return to central Florida next year, but they’ll consider rival attractions at Universal Studios Florida and SeaWorld, she said. Returning to Disney every year is no longer an option.

“Because of the astronomical expenses, I definitely think the magic is being taken away,” she said.

The Genie+ app feature replaced a system known as FastPass that used to come free with any ticket sold at Disneyland or Walt Disney World. The new service—along with a free version, known simply as Genie—does more than make Disney money: It also helps the parks’ operators direct traffic and spread people around the parks more evenly, to reduce waiting times overall, and upsell visitors by offering them promotions on food, merchandise and ride-reservation fees.

Each park has an operation center with a “heat map” that tracks where Genie+ users are in the parks using GPS technology. Park operators can direct traffic using the app by notifying visitors where the shortest lines are and offering food and merchandise promotions to cajole them to other areas.

“If I’m seeing too much activity on the west side, I’m able to spread where I direct people to the east side,” Mr. D’Amaro said. “Our attractions will be load-balanced better, and lines will be shorter, and what that means is the experience will be better.”

<span id=""32"" class=""red"">In an analysis for The Wall Street Journal, Touring Plans analyzed room prices, including taxes, at three popular Walt Disney World hotels over the past decade, and found increases that far outpaced inflation, which in July hit a record high <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 9.1%.</span>

</span>At Pop Century, a “value” hotel at the Orlando resort, the cheapest room rate rose <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $168 this</span> year from $95 <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013.</span></span> At the deluxe Animal Kingdom Lodge, a standard room now costs as much <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $790 a</span> night, versus up <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $486 a</span> decade ago.

<span id=""33"" class=""red"">Prices for tickets and certain food items have also climbed faster than inflation over the past decade, the Touring Plans analysis found.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">Disney fan blogs have noted that classic purchases at Disney parks, including the pineapple Dole Whip frozen treat ($5.99 last year,<span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $6.99 this</span> year at some locations) and studded Mickey Mouse-ears headbands ($29.99 last summer, <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">now $39.99</span>) are quickly getting costlier, outpacing inflation.

</span>In other cases, Disney has curtailed benefits. Guests staying at Disney-owned and certain other hotels at Walt Disney World before Covid could avail themselves of Extra Magic Hours, during which hotel guests could enter certain theme parks early or stay at them later into the night.

Today, Disney offers early entry at all four of its Walt Disney World parks each day to hotel guests, but only <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 30 minutes</span>; before the pandemic, it offered an hour of early admission, but only every other day. Evening extended hours are now only available to visitors staying at the most-expensive “deluxe” tier of hotels.

Disney says some guests prefer the new arrangement.

Mariana Epperson, a 29-year-old mom from Kentucky who works as an account manager for a credit-ratings firm, spent part of her honeymoon at Disneyland, and Walt Disney World is the site of some of her final happy memories with her father, who died a few weeks after she took a trip there with her family in May.

“A lot of people will say, ‘Oh, I can go to Europe for cheaper,’ ” she said. “But Disney now holds the last really good memories of my dad, so for me it’s so important. I can always make more money.”

Even so, this summer, her husband told her he needed a break from the theme parks. They’ve visited Disney resorts six times <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2017,</span> and the parks are getting way too expensive, she said. For their family vacation next year, they are thinking about a Disney cruise. Packages for three-night cruises from San Diego or Miami start at just <span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $1,000.</span> An ocean-view cabin costs more. So do between-meal snacks and excursions ashore.

Which options are worth paying for?

Updated Feb.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 22,</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 12</span>:01 am ET

Amir and Mojgan Moghadam <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $1.4 million</span> on their new home in Irvine, Calif. But to make it absolutely perfect, they spent a <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">further $550,000 on</span> builder upgrades—<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including $28,200 for</span> a conservatory,<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $2,600 for</span> a Sub-Zero ice maker <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $495 for</span> five exterior wall-light outlets.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Buying a newly built home is a lot like buying a new car at the dealership—optional features cost extra.</span> Buyers will pay more for premium granite, a fancier fridge or an epoxy-coated garage floor. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">And upgrades can be a lucrative part of a builder's business, with profit margins as high <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 60%,</span> depending on the option, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting.

</span>Indeed, buyers like the Moghadams are helping builders return to profitability after a long downturn. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">During the housing boom, homes were loaded with expensive features, and buyers snapped them up, regardless of price.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">These days, however, upscale buyers are choosier, selecting pricey options that are within their budgets and still practical for the resale market.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">An <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 10% to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30% of</span> a home's base price is spent on upgrades.</span> And companies say these optional features have been spurring growth in high-end home construction.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Record-low interest rates are driving much of this spending, with a 30-year, fixed-rate average <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3.68% for</span> conforming loans, which are <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $417,000 in</span> most markets, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 4.13% for</span> larger loans, according to HSH.com, a mortgage-research website.</span> Monica Kaiser, for instance, added <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $70,000 worth</span> of upgrades to <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $1 million</span>-plus San Diego home she and her husband purchased in December. The Kaisers decided to spend the money now—instead of later—for the upgrades they wanted. The Kaisers opted for <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $10,000 staircase</span> with wrought-iron balusters and <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $4,500 for</span> tile and stonework in the home's 41⁄2 bathrooms, along with other features from builder Standard Pacific.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">""With interest rates so low, you're not going to be able to get what you want any cheaper at any time,"" says Ms. Kaiser, a mother of three who works for local media outlet.</span> ""To put a lot of these upgrades in down the line would have just been silly, because we'd be paying more to take out a loan or dipping into other assets.""

Some builders present buyers with thousands of choices that let them build a near-custom home that won't resemble anything else in their community. Customizing a home can make a customer less likely to cancel the deal. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">""They're emotionally attached to what they have designed,"" says Joan Marcus-Colvin, senior vice president of sales, marketing and design for the New Home Co.</span> ""They have actually pictured themselves living in that surrounding.""

To this end, builders construct lavish model homes to showcase the full range of options. Toll Brothers, a luxury builder based in Horsham, Pa., is known for models that ""pretty much upgrade everything,"" says Denise DiBlasio, who manages Toll's design studio in Bucks County, Pa. Toll will put a fireplace in the master bath or a wine grotto in the basement.

In North Palm Beach, Fla., Toll poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into upgrades for the model home at its upscale Frenchman's Harbor community, where single-family homes start <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $1.7 million</span>. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The company says it is not unusual for a buyer to replicate the model or to copy the kitchen, regardless of cost.

</span>Toll, like many other builders, has bricks-and-mortar design centers stocked with samples of everything from carpet colors to granite slabs that customers can touch and coordinate with other items. Interior-design specialists are on hand to guide buyers on what's hot and help them avoid design disasters.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">The New Home Co., a three-year-old upscale builder in California with starting prices as high <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $2 million</span>, took <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in $9 million</span> from its design studios <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> up <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $7.6 million</span> the prior year.

</span>Publicly traded builders, who sell more homes but generally don't disclose profits from upgrades, can rake in much more. Jeffrey Burnett estimates he and his wife spent three full days at Toll's Boca Raton, Fla., design center, one <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 15 nationwide</span>, selecting extras for <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his $2.5 million</span> home under construction in Frenchman's Harbor. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">In the end, Mr. Burnett, chief executive officer of Labor Finders International, a nationwide blue-collar staffing company based in Palm Beach Gardens, <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">added $800,000 worth</span> of upgrades, including <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $100,000 tennis</span> court and a steam room.

</span>In the past decade, builders have increasingly been allowing buyers to pick favorite items through a website or app. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Buyers can almost think of it like a game: They choose options to build their dream homes, then add or delete items as the budget permits.

</span>""It was like I was going to the store,"" says Ms. Moghadam, the Irvine, Calif., buyer of the New Home Co. house. ""I would sit on my iPad and I would just pick out all the options I liked: cabinets, sinks, hardware, faucets. You could just do it at home and have fun with it.""

The most money is usually spent on kitchens, bathrooms and flooring, according to BDX, the marketing-services and technology company behind the Envision online design center that helps customers select options. Buyers upgrade <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">flooring 73% of</span> the time, <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cabinets 70% and</span> <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">appliances 63%,</span> the company says.

In the kitchen, large, granite-topped islands that seat four to eight people are popular, as are supersize showers with sitting space, says Jeffrey Lake, Standard Pacific's national head of architecture.

Northeasterners like crown molding and wainscoting, while Florida buyers often spring for a screened-in lanai and a bathroom specifically for the pool area. On the West Coast, consumers are more likely to add large glass doors that can be opened to seamlessly combine the family living space with the outdoors, he said.

Builders warn buyers to keep an eye on spending to avoid appraisal woes. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">An extensively upgraded home could appear overvalued when compared with recent nearby sales.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">If that happens, the builder may have to cut the price or ask the buyer for extra money at the closing.</span> For that reason—and to help pay for the purchase and installation of the upgrade—some builders require upgrade deposits in advance. The Moghadams, whose purchase contract for extras <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">covered 32 pages</span>, paid <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 50% of</span> their upgrades upfront, though that was spread across multiple payments.

<span id=""14"" class=""red"">M.D.C. Holdings, a builder that operates under the Richmond American Homes name, may ask for an additional deposit if a buyer's interior-design upgrades <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">exceed 13% of</span> the base price.</span> Typically, the additional deposit <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 50% of</span> the amount spent <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 13%.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Above 18%,</span> the buyer may have to place a deposit equal <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 100% of</span> additional upgrades. The company may also ask buyers to pay for unusual choices upfront. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">""If you order the pink carpet, we're probably going to ask you to put the full deposit on that one,"" says Bob Martin, the Denver-based builder's vice president of finance and business development who is currently picking out upgrades for his new home.</span> ""Nothing against pink,"" he adds.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">And, given consumer demand, more builders are making some upscale features—things like granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances—standard, even in lower-priced homes.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Some builders, like Miami-based Lennar, purchase popular options in bulk at a discount and include them in the home's base price.</span> This approach appeals to buyers who don't want to make many decisions or feel nickel-and-dimed when opting for an upgrade like an extra electrical outlet.

One upgrade tends to hold its value: land. Former NFL player Michael Hamilton decided to build a new Standard Pacific home in San Diego after seeing a roughly half-acre lot with views of coastal sage shrub and other native plants <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">near 1,600 acres</span> of preserved open space.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">Premium lots in the upscale Bellasario at Stonebridge Estates community cost up <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $215,000 above</span> the neighborhood'<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $900,000 base</span> price.</span> The upgraded lot gave Mr. Hamilton room for another upgrade, <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $100,000 backyard</span> cottage for guests. ""I wanted that lot and I wanted the casita,"" he said, adding that ""I wish I would have gotten a couple more upgrades.""

Negotiating as the clock ran down, Israeli parties ranging from the left to the far right, including an Arab bloc, agreed on a coalition government.
This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the Israeli election and its aftermath here.
JERUSALEM — Israeli opposition parties on Wednesday reached a coalition agreement to form a government and oust Benjamin Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history and a dominant figure who has pushed his nation’s politics to the right.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The announcement by the parties could lead to the easing of a political impasse that has produced four elections in two years and left Israel without a stable government or a state budget.</span> If Parliament ratifies the fragile agreement in a confidence vote in the coming days, it will also bring down the curtain, if only for an intermission, on the premiership of a leader who has defined contemporary Israel more than any other.
The new coalition is an unusual and awkward alliance between eight political parties from a diverse array of ideologies, from the left to the far right. It includes the membership of a small Arab party called Raam, which would become the first Arab group to join a right-leaning coalition in Israeli history.
While some analysts have hailed the coalition as reflecting the breadth and complexity of contemporary society, others say its members are too incompatible for their compact to last, and consider it the embodiment of Israel’s political dysfunction.
The alliance would be led <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2023 by</span> Naftali Bennett, a religiously observant former settler leader who opposes a Palestinian state and wants Israel to annex the majority of the occupied West Bank. He is a former ally of Mr. Netanyahu often described as more right-wing than the prime minister.
If the government lasts a whole term, it would then be led <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2023 and</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2025 by</span> Yair Lapid, a centrist former television host considered a standard-bearer for secular Israelis.
The son of American immigrants, Mr. Bennett,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 49,</span></span> is a former software entrepreneur, army commando, chief of staff to Mr. Netanyahu and defense minister. His home is in central Israel, but he was once chief executive of an umbrella group, the Yesha Council, that represents Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. Until the most recent election cycle, Mr. Bennett was part of a political alliance with Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right leader.
Though Mr. Bennett’s party, Yamina, won just seven of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 120 seats</span></span> in Parliament, the anti-Netanyahu forces could not form a government without his support, allowing him to set the terms of his involvement in the coalition.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Mr. Lapid,<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 57,</span> is a former news anchor and journalist who became a politician nine years ago and later served as finance minister in a Netanyahu-led coalition.</span> His party placed second in the general election in March, <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">winning 17 seats</span>. But Mr. Lapid considered the ouster of Mr. Netanyahu more important than demanding to go first as prime minister.
Yair Lapid, the leader of the Israeli opposition, had until midnight on Wednesday to cobble together an unlikely coalition to topple Benjamin Netanyahu. He needed almost every minute — leaving it until 11:22 p.m. to inform Reuven Rivlin, Israel’s largely ceremonial president, that he had assembled an eight-party alliance.
“The government will do everything it can to unite every part of Israeli society,” Mr. Lapid said in a statement released shortly after his call with Mr. Rivlin.
Mr. Lapid’s celebrations will be put on hold for several days, however. The speaker of the Israeli Parliament, Yariv Levin, is a member of Mr. Netanyahu’s party, Likud, and can use parliamentary procedure to delay the confidence vote until Monday, <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 14,</span> constitutional experts said.
In the meantime, Mr. Netanyahu’s party has promised to pile pressure on wavering members of Mr. Lapid’s fragile coalition, formed of hard-right parties, leftists, centrists and Arab Islamists, in a bid to persuade them to abandon the coalition. Many of them already feel uncomfortable about working with each other, and have made difficult compromises to join forces in order to push Mr. Netanyahu from office.
Mr. Lapid himself agreed to give Naftali Bennett, a hard-right former settler leader who opposes Palestinian statehood, the chance to lead the government <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2023,</span> at which point Mr. Lapid will take over.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">In a sign of the friction to come, Raam, the Arab Islamist party, announced that it had joined the coalition after receiving assurances about improvements to the Arab minority’s land and housing rights that many hard-right Israelis deem unacceptable, including the regularization of three illegally constructed Arab towns in the Negev desert.
</span>An hour before the deal was announced, one hard-right lawmaker, Nir Orbach, whose party colleagues say he has been particularly unsure about joining the coalition, tweeted: “We are not abandoning the Negev. Period.”
The fact that these tensions were on full display even before the coalition was officially formed has left many Israelis wondering whether it will last more than a few months, let alone its full term.
Should the coalition collapse, analysts believe Mr. Lapid may emerge with more credit than Mr. Bennett. While Mr. Bennett gets first crack at the premiership, his decision to work with centrists and leftists has angered his already small following.
“Lapid has made a very strong set of decisions, conveyed an amazing level of maturity and really made a big statement about a different kind of leadership,” said Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli political analyst and pollster at the Century Foundation, a New York-based research group. “That will not be lost on the Israeli public.”

Now that opposition parties have reached agreement on a coalition government, it has up to seven days to present the government to Parliament for a vote of confidence.
Some disagreements within the fractious coalition were still being ironed out until shortly before the deadline on Wednesday, at midnight in Israel.
And with the fate of the new coalition dependent on a narrow margin and hanging on every single vote, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies were on the hunt for potential defectors leading up to the announcement, and signaled that they would continue until the vote of confidence.
The coalition, ranging from right to left, is united primarily by its opposition to Mr. Netanyahu, the prime minister <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2009.</span>
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Israel has held four parliamentary elections in two years, all of them inconclusive, leaving it without a stable government or state budget.</span> If the opposition fails to form a government, it could lead to yet another election.
Naftali Bennett, who is poised to become Israel’s next prime minister, is a former high-tech entrepreneur best known for insisting that there must never be a full-fledged Palestinian state and that Israel should annex much of the occupied West Bank.
The independently wealthy son of immigrants from the United States, Mr. Bennett,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 49,</span></span> first entered the Israeli Parliament eight years ago and is relatively unknown and inexperienced on the international stage. That has left much of the world — and many Israelis — wondering what kind of leader he might be.
A former chief of staff to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, Mr. Bennett is often described as more right-wing than his old boss. Shifting between seemingly contradictory alliances, Mr. Bennett has been called an extremist and an opportunist. Allies say he is merely a pragmatist, less ideological than he appears, and lacking Mr. Netanyahu’s penchant for demonizing opponents.
In a measure of Mr. Bennett’s talents, he has now pulled off a feat that is extraordinary even by the perplexing standards of Israeli politics. He has all but maneuvered himself into the top office even though his party, Yamina, won just seven of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 120 seats</span></span> in the Parliament.
Mr. Bennett leveraged his modest but pivotal electoral weight after the inconclusive March election, Israel’s fourth in two years. He entered coalition talks as a kingmaker, and appears ready to emerge as the one wearing the crown.
Mr. Bennett has long championed West Bank settlers and once led the council representing them, though he is not a settler, himself. He is religiously observant — he would be the first prime minister to wear a kipa — but he will head a governing coalition that is largely secular.
He would lead a precarious coalition that spans Israel’s fractious political spectrum from left to right, and includes a small Arab, Islamist party — much of which opposes his ideas on settlement and annexation. That coalition proposes to paper over its differences on Israeli-Palestinian relations by focusing on domestic matters.
Mr. Bennett has explained his motives for teaming up with such ideological opposites as an act of last resort to end the political impasse that has paralyzed Israel.
“The political crisis in Israel is unprecedented on a global level,” he said in a televised speech on Sunday. “We could end up with fifth, sixth, even 10th elections, dismantling the walls of the country, brick by brick, until our house falls in on us. Or we can stop the madness and take responsibility.”
One of the most unlikely kingmakers involved in the formation of a new government is Mansour Abbas, the leader of the small Arab party known by its Hebrew acronym, Raam, with four seats in the current Parliament.
Under an 11th-hour deal, Raam formally agreed to join a Lapid-Bennett coalition government, though it would not hold any Cabinet seats. That was something of a surprise, as the party was expected to remain outside the coalition, while supporting it in a confidence vote in the Parliament. Some Arab lawmakers played a similar role by supporting Yitzhak Rabin’s government from the outside in the 1990s.
For decades, Arab parties have not been directly involved in Israeli governments. They have been mostly shunned by other parties, and are leery of joining a government that oversees occupation of the Palestinian territories and Israel’s military actions.
But after decades of political marginalization, many Palestinian citizens, who make up a fifth of Israel’s population, have been seeking fuller integration.
Israel’s early, leftist governments included Arab parties that were closely affiliated with the mostly Jewish parties. Raam would be the first independent Arab party in government, and the first Arab party of any kind in a right-leaning government.
Raam has been willing to work with both the pro- and anti-Netanyahu camps since the March election and to use its leverage to wrest concessions for the Arab public. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The party has refused to commit to a deal unless it gets assurances for greater resources and rights for Israel’s Arab minority, including reforms to housing legislation that potential hard-right coalition partners do not accept.

Sitting in her office in Parliament on Wednesday afternoon, Idit Silman, a hard-right lawmaker, flicked through hundreds of recent text messages from unknown numbers.
Some were laced with abusive language. Some warned she was going to hell. All of them demanded that her party abandon coalition negotiations with an alliance of centrist, leftist and right-wing lawmakers seeking to replace Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 12 years</span>.
“It’s very hard,” Ms. Silman said. “People would rather put pressure on Idit Silman than see Benjamin Netanyahu leave Balfour Street,” she added, in a reference to the location of the prime minister’s official residence.
As opposition negotiators race to meet a midnight deadline to agree on a new government, supporters of Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud party were working overtime to pressure Ms. Silman and other members of the right-wing Yamina party.
Many right-wing Israelis see Yamina’s turn against Mr. Netanyahu as a betrayal.
This onslaught gave Ms. Silman and her colleagues pause for thought — and an incentive to be seen as prolonging the negotiations for as long as possible. Though Yamina did finally join the coalition on Wednesday night, Mr. Netanyahu’s party, Likud, is likely to continue to play on these fears.
Parliament might not hold a vote of confidence in a new government for <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another 10 days</span>, giving Mr. Netanyahu more time to persuade Yamina lawmakers to reverse course.
His party has already promised to keep goading Ms. Silman and her colleagues.
“Behind the scenes,” said a senior Likud official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, “the Likud party is ramping up the pressure, particularly on the weakest links.”
The pressure has been relentless for days, since the phone numbers of Ms. Silman and her colleagues, they say, were posted on several WhatsApp and Facebook groups. That has prompted a barrage of messages — and not just from Israelis. Evangelical pastors in the United States have weighed in, and so have Hasidic activists in Britain, among many others.
The Likud party denies accusations that it posted any numbers publicly.
When Ms. Silman turned up at her local synagogue last week, she found several slick posters outside, each with her portrait overlaid with the slogan: “Idit Silman stitched together a government with terror supporters.”
For days, protesters have picketed her home, shouted abuse at her children, and trailed her by car in a menacing fashion, she said.
Yamina’s leader, Naftali Bennett, decided to negotiate with the opposition on Sunday night, after months of wavering. His calculus was based on realism, analysts say: Mr. Netanyahu cannot form a coalition, even with Mr. Bennett’s support. So Mr. Bennett can either fall in with the opposition, who have offered him the chance to be prime minister — or force the country to a fifth election in little more than two years.
“We always ask ourselves this question,” Ms. Silman said on Wednesday afternoon. “Is it right? Can we do something else?”
Patrick Kingsley and
Naftali Bennett, who leads a small right-wing party, and Yair Lapid, the centrist leader of the Israeli opposition, have joined forces to try to form a diverse coalition to unseat Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister.
Spanning Israel’s fractious political spectrum from left to right, and relying on the support of a small Arab, Islamist party, the proposed coalition, dubbed the “change government” by supporters, could signal a profound shift for Israel. Its leaders have pledged to end the cycle of divisive politics and inconclusive elections.
The opposition parties announced a coalition agreement on Wednesday. But even if they survive a vote of confidence in the Parliament and form a government, toppling Mr. Netanyahu, how much change would their “change government” bring, when some of the parties agree on little else besides antipathy for Israel’s longest-serving leader?
Mr. Bennett, whose party won seven seats in Parliament, is often described as further to the right than Mr. Netanyahu. While Mr. Netanyahu eroded the idea of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr. Bennett, a religiously observant champion of Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, openly rejects the concept of a sovereign Palestinian state and has advocated annexing West Bank territory.
Still, though the coalition will include several parties that disagree on both those issues, they have agreed to allow Mr. Bennett to become prime minister first.
If the coalition deal holds, Mr. Bennett would be replaced for the second part of the four-year term by Mr. Lapid, who advocates for secular, middle-class Israelis and whose party <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">won 17 seats</span>.
By conceding the first turn in the rotation, Mr. Lapid, who has been branded as a dangerous leftist by his opponents on the right, smoothed the way for other right-wing politicians to join the new anti-Netanyahu alliance.
In a measure of the plot twists and tumult behind this political turnaround, Mr. Bennett had pledged before the election not to enable a Lapid government of any kind or any government reliant on the Islamist party, called Raam.
The coalition would stand or fall on the cooperation between eight parties with disparate ideologies and, on many issues, clashing agendas.
In a televised address on Sunday night, Mr. Bennett said he was committed to fostering national unity.
“Two thousand years ago, there was a Jewish state which fell here because of internal quarrels,” he said. “This will not happen again. Not on my watch.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Even as the country and its Parliament remained deeply divided over the formation of a new government, Israeli lawmakers came together on Wednesday to elect a new president, Isaac Herzog, a former leader of the Labor party and government minister.
</span>Displaying a rare degree of consensus in a secret ballot, they voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Herzog, who currently serves as the chairman of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency for Israel, which helps deal with immigration, interacts with the Jewish diaspora and runs social programs.
The president plays a mostly symbolic role as a national unifier in Israel’s fractious parliamentary democracy, where the prime minister wields the most power.
One of a president’s main responsibilities is to grant a candidate the task of forming a government after elections. In Israel’s current, fragmented politics, which have produced four inconclusive elections in two years, that involves more than the usual level of skill, legal interpretation and discretion.
The president can also play an important role in Israeli diplomacy and has the power to pardon convicted criminals and exercise clemency by reducing or commuting sentences.

Less than a month ago, an eruption of intense fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip plunged Israeli and Palestinian communities into chaos. As the civilian casualties grew, overwhelmingly on the Gaza side, the conflict polarized Israeli society, and the world, in ways seldom seen before.
At <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 230 people</span> were killed in Gaza during the war, including at <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 65 children</span>, while in Israel at <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 12 were</span> killed, including two children. Gaza’s infrastructure, already ailing, was gutted by Israeli airstrikes on the densely populated territory. And Israeli towns and cities within range of Hamas rockets went into repeated, frightening lockdowns in shelters.
The war also spurred unrest within Israel and the occupied territories that has been more explosive than any in years. It has inspired a new era of Palestinian activism, and has shifted the ground politically, coloring the drama that was playing out in Israel on Wednesday.
Here is what to know about the 11-day war, and its lasting effects.
JERUSALEM — For Israelis, the possible downfall of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the country’s longest-serving leader, is an epochal moment. Israeli media have barraged their audiences with reports and commentary on the opposition attempts to form a government.
But for many Palestinians, the political drama has prompted little more than a shrug and a resurgence of bitter memories.
During Mr. Netanyahu’s current 12-year tenure, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process fizzled, as Israeli and Palestinian leaders accused each other of obstructing the process, and Mr. Netanyahu expressed increasing skepticism about the possibility of a sovereign Palestinian state.
But to many Palestinians, his likely replacement as prime minister, Naftali Bennett, would be no improvement. Mr. Bennett is Mr. Netanyahu’s former chief of staff, and a former settler leader who outright rejects Palestinian statehood.
Instead, many Palestinians are consumed by their own political moment, which some activists have framed as the most pivotal in decades.
The Palestinian polity has long been physically and politically fragmented between the American-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank; its archrival, Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza; a Palestinian minority inside Israel whose votes might make or break an Israeli government; and a sprawling diaspora.
But spurred by last month’s 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and the worst bout of intercommunal Arab-Jewish violence to have convulsed Israel in decades, these disparate parts suddenly came together in a seemingly leaderless eruption of shared identity and purpose.
In a rare display of unity, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians observed a general strike on <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 12 across</span> Gaza, the West Bank, the refugee camps of Lebanon and inside Israel itself.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“I don’t think whoever is in charge in Israel will make a great deal of difference to the Palestinians,” said Ahmad Aweidah, the former head of the Palestinian stock exchange.</span> “There might be slight differences and nuances, but all mainstream Israeli parties, with slight exceptions on the extreme left, share pretty much the same ideology.”
The strike in mid-May, Mr. Aweidah said, “showed that we are united no matter what the Israelis have tried to do <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 73 years</span>: categorizing us into Israeli Arabs, West Bankers, Jerusalemites, Gazans, refugees and diaspora.”
“None of that has worked,” he said. “We are back to square one.”",,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,4,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,

May’s increase was driven in part by sharp rises in the prices for energy, which <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 34.6% from</span> a year earlier, and groceries, which <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">jumped 11.9% on</span> the year, the biggest increase <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1979.</span></span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">But inflation pressures were distinctly broad-based in May, said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.

</span>“Given everything from the implications of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Chinese lockdowns and just the sheer appetite for travel...what we’ve seen is the perfect storm of those factors hitting, along with some major refinery closures,” she said. “Inflationary pressures were seen nearly everywhere.”

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The inflation news hit stock and bond prices, with investors’ fearing the Federal Reserve could be forced to act more aggressively to tame surging price increases.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Prices for used cars and trucks—a key engine of the past year’s inflation surge—<span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 1.8% in</span> May from April, reversing three months of declines.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Shelter costs, an indicator of broad inflation pressures, accelerated on a monthly basis in May and were <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 5.5%,</span> compared with a year ago.

</span>Airline fares <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 12.6% on</span> the month, the third straight double-digit rise.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">“We suspect that the formidable momentum in inflation could push the headline rate for CPI close <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 9% as</span> early as next month,” said Ms. House, adding that it is likely to stay near those levels through the autumn.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">The May inflation figures came as consumer sentiment soured further on the economy.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The preliminary estimate of the consumer sentiment index published Friday by the University of Michigan fell <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 50.2 in</span> June <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 58.4 in</span> May, marking its lowest reading on record.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Nearly half of those surveyed attributed their negative views to inflation, up <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 38% the</span> prior month, and long-term inflation expectations rose to the highest level <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span>

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">High inflation is a downside of strong U.S. growth, fueled in part by low interest rates and government stimulus to counter the Covid-19 pandemic’s impact.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The annual rate of inflation has risen sharply since <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2021,</span> when the U.S. economy’s rebound from the pandemic accelerated, leading to supply disruptions and other imbalances that put upward pressure on prices for longer than policy makers anticipated.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">The Fed faces the difficult task of tightening monetary policy enough to cool the economy and calm inflation, while avoiding a recession.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Fed officials on <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 4 lifted</span> rates by a half-percentage point and will meet again next week to consider a similar increase.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">Economists and policy makers had been watching closely for signs that inflationary pressures are ebbing.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">But May’s resurgence in price increases ratchets up pressure on the Fed to raise rates aggressively to tame inflation, said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">“The breadth of inflation pressures in the economy should alarm the Fed,” he said.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">On a monthly basis, the CPI jumped a seasonally <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">adjusted 1% in</span> May after <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rising 0.3% in</span> the prior month.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">The so-called core-price index, which excludes the often volatile categories of food and energy, <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">increased 0.6% on</span> the month, the same as in April.</span> That compares with an average monthly gain <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 0.2% for</span> both measures in the two years before the pandemic.

<span id=""22"" class=""red"">On a 12-month basis, the core-price index <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">increased 6% in</span> May, down <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 6.2% in</span> April.</span> March’<span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 6.5% rise</span> was the highest rate since <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">August 1982.</span>

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Inflation was highest in the South, <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 9.2%,</span> and the Midwest, where prices <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 8.8%.</span></span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Residents of the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater area of Florida swallowed <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">an 11.3% increase</span> over <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 12 months</span> ended in May, driven in part by a sharp rise in rental prices.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Inflation was <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 6.3% in</span> the New York City metropolitan area, due in part to relatively low rental-price gains.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">“I understand inflation is a real challenge to American families,” said President Biden, speaking at the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, Calif.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">He added the administration would do “everything we can to lower prices for the American people and Congress has to act,” and cited efforts to reduce backlogs of supplies at U.S. ports.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Energy prices rose in May as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continued to push up prices for crude-oil and natural gas.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">Gasoline prices have breached record levels in recent weeks.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">The average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gas in the U.S. <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">hit $5 Friday</span> night, according to OPIS, an energy-data and analytics provider.

</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">The strength in energy price rises will keep putting upward pressure on inflation, said Ms. House, the Wells Fargo economist.

</span>Consumers’ grocery bills have risen by an annual rate of more <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10% since</span> earlier this year, a pace last seen in the early 1980s. <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Food price increases are unusually broad, and every single grocery category measured in the report rose in May from a year ago—most of them by double digits.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">There are numerous causes, unlike early in the pandemic when meat prices drove much of the increase, said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.

</span>“It’s not just the weather—it’s diseases affecting citrus trees and chickens. <span id=""34"" class=""red"">It’s the Ukraine conflict,” which has affected prices for baked goods and cereals, he said.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">Drought, too, is hitting prices for vegetables and other crops.

</span>“For people on lower incomes, this is not discretionary spending,” Mr. Ashworth said. “Other than substituting out cheaper food types—cheaper meat cuts, whatever it might be—people need to continue buying food.”

<span id=""36"" class=""red"">Price pressures are strong across much of the economy in part because of an unusually tight U.S. labor market, with demand for workers outstripping supply.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">Employers <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">added 390,000 jobs</span> last month, and the unemployment rate hovered near a half-century low.</span> <span id=""38"" class=""red"">Still, even after the economy gained more <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 6.5 million</span> jobs in the space of a year, fewer Americans are employed as a share of the population than before the pandemic.

</span><span id=""39"" class=""red"">Those dynamics are driving wage growth, adding to inflationary pressures.</span> <span id=""40"" class=""red"">Strong gains in wages and hiring are pumping more money into Americans’ bank accounts, propping up demand as inflation erodes spending power for many.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, higher labor costs stemming from worker shortages are prompting many employers to raise prices.

</span><span id=""42"" class=""red"">Demand for travel and other services has surged as the impact of Covid-19 recedes and people spend more freely on experiences they missed out on during the worst of the pandemic.</span> <span id=""43"" class=""red"">This is pushing up prices for these services.</span> <span id=""44"" class=""red"">Airline fares <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">surged 37.8% from</span> a year ago, while hotel prices <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 19.3% higher</span>.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">Restaurant prices <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 7.4%,</span> the sharpest rise <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1981.</span>

</span><span id=""46"" class=""red"">Despite strong demand for summer activities such as travel, higher prices are eating into many business owners’ profitability.</span> In <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2020,</span> Suzanne Hoffman, an author who runs wine tours in Italy, canceled group tours to Piedmont because of the pandemic. A number of guests rolled over their deposits and are finally taking their trips this summer.

<span id=""47"" class=""red"">“The demand is there; people are just champing at the bit,” said Ms. Hoffman, who is based in Edwards, Colo.

</span><span id=""48"" class=""red"">But the people taking those long-delayed trips are <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paying 2019 prices</span>, she said, while fuel, dining and other costs to conduct the tours have gone up.</span> That is hurting Ms. Hoffman’s bottom line to the extent that she might stop running future tours given the uncertain outlook.

“I canceled my October tour. I just don’t want to make any commitments beyond this summer,” she said.

<span id=""49"" class=""red"">Some main drivers of inflation could be easing.

</span><span id=""50"" class=""red"">The backlog in cargo ships waiting to unload in Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., fell for the fourth straight month in May, said Oren Klachkin of Oxford Economics.</span> Target Corp. recently said the need to unload unwanted goods would cause its profit to drop. Clothes retailers have also been caught with swelling inventories of casual clothes and home items as shoppers scaled back spending on goods that had been popular throughout the pandemic.

<span id=""51"" class=""red"">But supply bottlenecks are easing too slowly and too sporadically to ease inflationary pressures, economists say.</span> <span id=""52"" class=""red"">Energy disruptions caused by the Ukraine war and the lack of workers to fill vacancies in the U.S. are exacerbating strains on the economy’s ability to meet demand without price rises.

</span><span id=""53"" class=""red"">The breadth and persistence of these supply problems means that for inflation to ease, demand must come down, said Mr. Knightley of ING.</span> <span id=""54"" class=""red"">“To get demand into better balance with the supply the onus is on the Federal Reserve to do the heavy lifting,” he said.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The innovation has sent nickel prices tumbling to less <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $14,000 a</span> metric ton, and turned China into a leading nickel producer.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The country now turns out more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 400,000 metric</span> tons of nickel pig iron a year, equal to a fifth of world-wide demand.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Economists for years warned that rising demand for natural resources by China and other emerging markets would outstrip supply, leaving the world short of everything from nickel to coal, copper and corn.

</span>But a remarkable period of innovation and investment has produced a far different picture. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Expanded supply has helped moderate commodity prices over the past year after a decade of demand from China helped push many prices into the stratosphere.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The International Monetary Fund's index of all commodity prices is down <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 12% from</span> recent peaks; it had roughly tripled <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Between 2000 and</span></span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2011.</span></span> Copper is <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 28% from</span> its record high <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span> while thermal coal has fallen by more than half since <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2008 peak</span>.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Of course, price declines are also driven by weaker demand, especially in China, where economic growth has slowed.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">And prices for many commodities, including oil, remain far above their average <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 10 or</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 15 years</span> ago.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">But the global supply picture is the best in years.</span> ""It's kind of basic econ 101: Scarcity induces some sort of innovation,"" said David Jacks, an associate professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who has studied commodity cycles over the past century.

The most widely known innovation is the oil-field technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which fueled the shale boom by injecting water and other materials into the earth to unlock oil and natural gas.

But in agriculture, farmers are tapping new patches of arable land, and turning to higher-yielding hybrid seeds.

In the mining industry, drilling companies are using diamond-coated drill bits to reach miles farther beneath the earth's surface. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">They also employ aircraft radar to map the geology of remote areas.</span> Firms that mix chemicals into minerals to make desired metals rise to the top or sink to the bottom now extract more product than ever from lower-grade deposits.

On top of all that, many projects that were funded years ago—including new or expanded copper, silver and nickel mines—have started producing.

As as result, mine production has nearly doubled or tripled for every major metal over the past two decades, according to the U.S. Geological Survey and other organizations.

<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Between 2000 and</span></span><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012,</span> aluminum output increased <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 45.7 million</span> metric tons <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 24.7 million</span>, according to the Raw Materials Group Stockholm, a consultancy. Production of iron ore, used in steelmaking, hit two billion metric tons from <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 975 million</span> over the same period.

Global production of corn, meanwhile, rose by <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 270 million</span> metric tons over the past decade, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. That growth was the biggest 10-year increase on record and more than triple the gains of the previous decade.

Output of palm oil, used in cookies and instant noodles, has more than doubled since the start of the last decade, and so has the harvest of walnuts and almonds.

All this expanded production has often come with environmental costs, which in various places include air pollution, clear-cut forests and water tainted by chemicals.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">And it remains unclear how the world can sustain the commodity-production gains still needed to meet future demand.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Per capita consumption of energy and other resources in China remains lower than in the West, which means more production increases will be needed in the future as the Chinese economy grows.</span> Many easy-to-reach minerals have been exhausted, likely raising future production costs.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">But innovations of the past decade show how market signals help unlock new supply.</span> The period compares with advances in copper production during the 1920s, Mr. Jacks said. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">And demand during World War II led to the expansion of synthetic rubber production.

</span>Minerals companies, for example, have improved the chemical process to extract raw materials from waste rock. Rio Tinto in Utah extracts silver, gold and molybdenum from the muddy sludge that is a byproduct of mining copper. In Minnesota, a company called Magnetation Inc. has developed machines that use magnets to extract iron ore from mining waste.

China's nickel production is one of the most dramatic examples of fresh thinking. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">In the early 2000s, prices were <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $10,000 per</span> metric ton.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Then China's economy took off, along with new demand for stainless steel, which requires nickel and iron.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Nickel prices <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">surpassed $51,000 per</span> ton in mid-2007.

</span>Chinese stainless steel producers were furious, especially since much of the world's nickel supplies were dominated by such foreign companies as BHP Billiton Ltd., Vale SA of Brazil, and Russia's MMC Norilsk Nickel.

Most nickel production at the time came from so-called sulfide deposits in places like Canada and Russia, where mines were being depleted.

There were plenty of lower-grade laterite deposits in Indonesia and elsewhere. It could be refined into nickel pig iron, which contains a relatively small portion of nickel—usually less than 15%—mixed with iron. But processing the laterite ore required lots of energy and created lots of pollution.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">Analysts figured it <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cost $20,000 or</span> more per metric ton to make nickel pig iron, more than double the market price for nickel in the early 2000s.</span> Mining companies often tossed laterite nickel aside.

<span id=""19"" class=""red"">But when nickel prices climbed, China saw a competitive advantage: it still had scores of old, inefficient blast furnaces.</span> Beijing had been pressing steelmakers to shut them down. But with some fine-tuning, the blast furnaces could refine laterite ore into nickel pig iron, which can be used to make some steel alloys, including stainless steel.

Early Chinese producers burned coal, oil, wood chips and other materials to refine the laterite, which came mostly from Indonesia. The final product had only a small amount of nickel, but also iron, both needed ingredients.

<span id=""20"" class=""red"">As prices continued to climb, nickel pig iron became economical, and furnaces along China's eastern coast were put to work.

</span>The Tsingshan Holding Group was among the leaders. As one of China's major producers of stainless steel, it needed lots of nickel.

The company was encouraged by early trials with nickel pig iron, but the refining process was still crude and dirty. So Tsingshan began experiments, including at a plant near Ningde, a coastal town in Fujian province surrounded by low green mountains and grape farms.

The company tried rotary kiln electric furnaces, which use less energy than blast furnaces and can extract more nickel from the ore.

Many people were skeptical, said John Li, a Tsingshan-subsidiary vice president in Ningde. One day, he said, a furnace started leaking iron slag everywhere.

But the process eventually succeeded, trimming electricity needs by as much <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 40%,</span> said Jiang Xinfang, president-director of another Tsingshan subsidiary in Shanghai. Tsingshan now pumps out nickel pig iron <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 11% nickel</span>, the company said, compared <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 2% or</span> less using older techniques.

""At its core, this is a sort of revolution in the way nickel units are made,"" said Andrew Shaw, a commodities analyst at Credit Suisse in Singapore.

Tsingshan now gets about half the nickel it needs from its own nickel pig iron, Mr. Li said. At its Ningde-area operations, a port unloads ships of Indonesian ore, which is piled in tall dark-brown mounds that cover an area roughly the size of a football field.

<span id=""21"" class=""red"">Later, the ore is transferred to a smelting plant where it is fed into a tangle of rust-colored pipes, smokestacks and rotating kilns for conversion into liquid nickel pig iron.

</span>A blanket of foul-smelling smog envelops areas near Tsingshan's operation, though there are many other factories nearby, making it hard to know where all the pollution comes from. Some residents blame the pig iron plant.

Analysts say mining of Indonesian ore involves destructive stripping of the land in that country, as well.

But the rotary-kiln process has made refining significantly cleaner, according to analysts. Mr. Jiang at Tsingshan said his company's newest-generation operations include antidust equipment and low-sulfur coal.

Tsingshan's breakthroughs have been replicated across China. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">As nickel pig iron technology has improved, analysts say, the cost of processing it has fallen to as low <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $12,500 per</span> metric ton.

</span>""There's been this huge deflationary effect on the nickel industry as nickel pig iron has developed,"" said Gayle Berry, an analyst at Barclays in London. ""It certainly has destroyed the world"" for traditional nickel, added Jim Lennon, a nickel expert and consultant to Australia's Macquarie Bank, though supplies could tighten again in the future.

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">One concern for producers is that Indonesia may restrict exports of nickel ore next year to entice mining companies to build refining operations there.</span> Tsingshan is one of several companies taking steps to do so.

<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, Western miners are scrambling to deal with the new supply.</span> Analysts estimated that as much <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 40% of</span> the nickel mining industry is losing money these days. <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Some predict China will keep finding ways to supply its own needs.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive of Glencore-Xstrata, the world's fourth-largest nickel miner, said earlier this year he was pessimistic about the metal's future price.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">In October, his company announced it would mothball its Falcondo mine in the Dominican Republic because of falling nickel prices, eliminating as many <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 1,000 jobs</span>.</span> The company mines nickel ore in five countries, including Indonesia and sells much of it to China to make nickel pig iron.

""China is becoming self-sufficient"" in nickel, said Vladimir Potanin, chief executive of Norilsk, the world's top nickel producer. ""They are producing steel, which they need for their industrial development. They need this nickel pig iron close to where the steel is made. I think they're smart enough, and powerful enough to keep doing both forever.""

Mr. Li, of the Tsingshan subsidiary, was pleased with his country's revamping of nickel production, with benefits extending around the world. ""If we didn't have this nickel process in China,"" he said. <span id=""28"" class=""red"">""I think prices would <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">be $80,000.</span></span>""

Updated Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2022 11</span>:10 am ET

The U.K.’s annual rate of inflation moved into double digits in July and is set to rise even higher by the end of the year, heaping greater pressure on stretched household budgets and threatening a lengthy economic contraction.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">That pickup in inflation has been replicated in other parts of Europe, even as consumer prices have started to slow in the U.S.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">That is because energy prices have continued to accelerate across Europe as Russia withholds supplies of natural gas, with the continent facing a possible crunch this winter.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The U.K.’s Office for National Statistics Wednesday said consumer prices <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 10.1% higher</span> in July than a year earlier, up <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 9.4% in</span> June.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">That was the highest rate of inflation in more than four decades and the fastest increase in prices recorded in one of the Group of Seven rich countries since the current surge started in <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2021.</span>

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">“Inflation figures continue to paint a worrying picture for consumers and businesses alike, and price pressures are set to build further,” said Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the Confederation of British Industry.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Figures to be released Thursday by the European Union’s statistics agency are expected to show the eurozone’s annual rate of inflation rose <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 8.9% in</span> July <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 8.6% in</span> June.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">By contrast, U.S. inflation eased <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 8.5% in</span> July <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 9.1% in</span> June.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Economists at JPMorgan see increasing signs that global inflation is set to ease, with prices of food and many commodities down from recent peaks.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">However, they expect that disinflation to be evident first in the U.S., with Europe set to lag behind despite some recent easing in the prices of goods leaving factory gates.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">“Europe, however, faces ongoing pressure from surging natural gas prices that have more than doubled over the past three months,” they wrote in a note to clients.</span> “We expect the combined drag of a squeeze on purchasing power and depressed sentiment to tip the region into recession this year.”

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">July is unlikely to mark the peak in U.K. inflation, since household energy costs are set to rise sharply when a cap on prices is lifted in October.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The Bank of England estimates that could send the annual rate of inflation <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 13% as</span> the year draws to a close.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">The U.K. is suffering a particularly severe surge in prices in part because of <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 2016 decision</span> to leave the European Union, which has caused costs for importers to increase, while a weaker pound has also raised the prices of goods and services purchased overseas.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Brexit has also reduced the availability of foreign workers in some lower-paid services industries, such as hospitality, pushing costs and prices higher.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">However, the U.K. might not be the only one of Europe’s three G-7 members set to face the double-digit inflation that has already hit Spain, Greece and a number of the EU’s eastern members.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Germany’s gas regulator Monday announced a surcharge on gas prices designed to cover most of the increased costs to home energy suppliers since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Economists estimate that will send Germany’s annual rate of inflation <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 10% from</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7.5% in</span> July.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">U.K. figures released Tuesday by the ONS showed wages excluding bonuses <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 4.7% higher</span> in the three months through June than a year earlier, a pickup from <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 4.4% rate</span> of growth recorded in the three months through May.

Much of the pickup came from the private sector, where wages were <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5.</span>9% when</span> bonuses are included.</span> Many businesses are giving workers one-off payments to help cover surging energy and food costs, as well as standard pay rises. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Labor union Unite on Monday said British Airways had agreed to pay its check-in staff a lump sum equivalent <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 5% of</span> their salaries this month, with a <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">regular 5% pay</span> rise to follow in September, and a <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">further 3% increase</span> in January.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">“Like most other workers, our members in BA are struggling with the cost of living crisis,” said Oliver Richardson, a Unite official.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">The acceleration in wage rises will worry the Bank of England, which wants to avert a self-reinforcing series of wage and price rises of the kind that kept inflation high for many years in the 1970s.

</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Investors now expect the central bank to raise its key interest rate by a half percentage point when policy makers next meet in mid-September, having broken with a quarter-century tradition of only increasing borrowing costs by a quarter point in each step earlier this month.

</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">“Today’s ugly inflation print combined with the stronger earnings read should keep the MPC on track to deliver multiple 50bps hikes this year,” said Sanjay Raja, an economist at Deutsche Bank.</span> “Relative to our base case, risks are tilted to an even more front-loaded and protracted hiking cycle.”

<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Even as it picked up, wage growth fell further behind the rate of inflation, with the result that real wages <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 4.1%,</span> the largest decline since records began <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2001.</span></span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">That blow to consumer spending threatens to push the economy into an even deeper contraction than the central bank already expects.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">The European Central Bank is also seeking to strike a balance between tackling surging inflation and limiting the hit to the eurozone economy from higher energy prices.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">It also broke with recent practice by raising its key rate by a half percentage point in July, and many economists expect it to repeat that move next month.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">The U.K. government has already announced three packages of support to help households meet higher energy bills without having to cut back on other essentials, but economists expect a fourth package to follow the election of a new prime minister early next month.

</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">The government’s response to what has become known as the cost-of-living crisis has been on hold since Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ousted as head of the ruling Conservative Party in early July, and the lengthy process of choosing his successor is due to end on Sept.<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5.</span>

</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">“We’ll prepare all the options, ready for the incoming prime minister so that they can hit the ground running on what more we can do,” said Nadhim Zahawi, the U.K.’s Treasury chief.

</span>The German government, and others in Europe, are also considering additional support for households that face skyrocketing energy costs.

“We’re putting together another relief package,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote in a tweet Monday. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">“We don’t leave anyone alone with the higher costs.”

66574421e5b48f8b30994340,88390,"<h3>Inside Mitch McConnell’s decades-long effort to block gun control</h3>Mitch McConnell was just finishing up his first term as the junior senator from Kentucky when a mass shooting rocked his hometown of Louisville.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">On Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1989,</span> a disgruntled employee entered the Standard Gravure printing plant in downtown Louisville and, armed with an AK-47 and other guns, killed eight and <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">wounded 12 others</span> before taking his own life — in what remains the deadliest mass shooting in the state’s history.

</span>At the time, mass shootings had not yet become the staple of American life that they are now, and McConnell said he was “deeply disturbed,” declaring, “We must take action to stop such vicious crimes.”

But he also added: “We need to be careful about legislating in the middle of a crisis.” And in the days and weeks after, he did not join others in calling for a ban on assault weapons like the AK-47 used by the shooter.

The Standard Gravure massacre provided an early glimpse of how McConnell — now the Republican Senate minority leader — would handle mass shootings and their aftermath over the next three decades, consistently working to delay, obstruct or prevent most major gun-control legislation from passing Congress.

McConnell would go on to follow a similar playbook time and time again during his seven terms in Congress, offering vague promises of action, often without any specifics, only to be followed by no action or incremental measures that avoided new gun regulations. As a Republican leader, he also helped dissuade his conference — as after <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2012 mass</span> shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. — from supporting gun legislation and, as majority leader, refused to bring up significant gun-control measures for a vote.

Now, the latest devastating and high-profile mass shootings — a massacre Tuesday at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Tex., that <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">left 19 students</span> and two teachers dead, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 10 days</span> after a racist slaughter at Buffalo supermarket that <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">killed 10 </span>— have thrust Congress back into a fiery debate over what, if anything, lawmakers can do to curb gun violence.

On Thursday, McConnell told CNN that he had encouraged Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) to reach out to Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) — who made gun control a personal project after Sandy Hook — to begin discussing what bipartisan measures might be possible.

But many Democrats and anti-gun advocates remain skeptical, predicting that McConnell and his fellow Republicans are poised to obstruct any consequential gun-violence-prevention bills yet again.

“If there’s any one individual in the United States to blame for our inability to put things in place to prevent gun violence, it’s Mitch McConnell,” said Peter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords, a group devoted to fighting gun violence. “McConnell understands he’s hostage to that extreme base that just doesn’t tolerate any departure from any of their views.”

Many Republicans say that McConnell is less a singular obstacle than a savvy leader who is able to his read his conference and make decisions that help his senators and protect them politically. “McConnell knows where his members stand and makes the tough calls to protect their interests,” a senior Republican aide said, explaining McConnell’s overall motivations in addressing gun violence and gun legislation.

McConnell declined to comment.

<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1990,</span> the year after the Standard Gravure shooting, McConnell was up for reelection and found himself in a close race with Democrat Harvey Sloane, then the Jefferson County judge executive and a former Louisville mayor, who had called for banning assault weapons.

<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2013,</span> following Sandy Hook, Sloane recounted in Louisville’s Courier-Journal newspaper that as his race with McConnell tightened in the final stretch, McConnell and the National Rifle Association “blistered the state falsely as to how this ban would eventually take away ‘your hunting gun and the hand pistol you need for personal protection.’ ”

McConnell defeated Sloane by five percentage points and, in his second term in the Senate, went on to vote against both the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1993 and</span> the Federal Assault Weapons Ban <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1994.</span>

“Mitch is really Machiavellian,” Sloane said in an interview with The Washington Post last week. “He’s single-handedly held up any kind of gun legislation that’s meaningful.”

‘It didn’t change a thing’

In <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2019,</span> a group of gun-control advocates — including Kris Brown, the president of Brady, a gun violence prevention organization; Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights icon; and Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.), who lost her 17-year-old son in <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2012 shooting</span> — gathered on the West Lawn of the Capitol for a rally in favor of tougher background checks.

After the rally, some in the group — which also included some McConnell constituents — decided to make their way to the then-majority leader’s office for what Lewis might have called “good trouble.”

“So we walked over, John Lewis kind of leading us, talking about the importance of peaceful resistance,” Brown recalled, adding that Lewis asked if someone should get Depends — a brand of adult diapers — because the group might be there for a while.

“His staffers had no idea what to do with us,” Brown said. “McConnell didn’t have the human decency to sit down with John Lewis.”

Instead, a McConnell staffer ushered the group into a conference room and met with them for over an hour. Brown said that the staffer clearly seemed moved by Lewis, telling him that she held him in high esteem, and by the victims of gun violence, who recounted their stories one after another.

“She was moved to tears, but it didn’t change a thing,” Brown said, saying the staffer essentially told the group “that it was just the wrong time to bring this bill forward.”

Doug Andres, a McConnell spokesman, said McConnell had been unable to meet with the group at the time because it was a surprise visit and he already had constituent meetings planned. He said the staffer simply explained to the group that then-President Donald Trump was unlikely to sign the bill they were pitching, and McConnell was not going to advocate for legislation he knew would fail.

For McConnell, however, the time has rarely seemed right.

Almost immediately after Sandy Hook, then-President Barack Obama tasked then-Vice President Joe Biden with putting together a robust policy response. McConnell — then the Senate minority leader — downplayed the effort.

Asked about gun-control issues on ABC’s “This Week” in <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2013 </span>— less than month after Sandy Hook — <span id=""1"" class=""red"">McConnell said he was waiting to see Biden’s proposal but did not plan to prioritize it over other issues like “spending and debt” in the coming months.

</span>Then, later that month — after Obama <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">signed 23 executive</span> orders on guns in response to the tragedy that <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">left 20 kindergartners</span> dead — McConnell recorded a robocall and sent it out to gun owners in his state.

“President Obama and his team are doing everything in their power to restrict your constitutional right to keep and bear arms,” McConnell said in the recording. “Their efforts to restrict your rights, invading your personal privacy and overstepping their bounds with executive orders, is just plain wrong.”

McConnell also refused a meeting with the Sandy Hook families, according to someone familiar with the request, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal details. But eventually, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W. Va.) and Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) negotiated a modest bipartisan background checks bill, known as Manchin-Toomey.

At the time, McConnell was still adjusting to the rise of the hard-right tea party movement in the Republican base; in <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2010 Republican</span> Senate primary in Kentucky, Rand Paul vanquished Trey Grayson, McConnell’s handpicked candidate, by riding the tea party wave in what some also viewed as a stinging rebuke of McConnell. And <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2013,</span> McConnell was already preparing for <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2014 reelection</span> bid.

When Manchin-Toomey finally came to the Senate floor for a vote in <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2013,</span> McConnell pushed his conference to oppose the bill, which ultimately <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">failed 54 to</span><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 46,</span> falling short of <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 60 votes</span> needed for passage.

“McConnell whipped hard against it. McConnell is obsessed with protecting his right flank,” said Adam Jentleson, who at the time worked for then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), explaining why McConnell helped tank the background check bill. “It’s why he’s been able to survive as leader for so long.”

Jesse Benton — a conservative activist who managed Paul’<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2010 Senate</span> campaign and who McConnell enlisted to manage <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2014 one</span> — said that McConnell at the time “said something to me like, ‘I hope you know I’m not planning on supporting any of this crap.' ”

“He’s not a firebrand like some of the [pro-gun] activists want, but he makes it clear to his team that he is a Second Amendment believer,” Benton said. “He respects the legislative process and the fact that there are differing opinions in his own caucus, but he works it in his own way, as only he can.”

McConnell was, at other times, willing to entertain the idea of some legislation on guns, partly as a way of releasing pressure from members of his caucus who wanted to show some legislative action after mass shootings.

But that approach has also earned him the ire of some Second Amendment advocates, some of whom ran ads against him during <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2014 primary</span>.

“When the going gets tough, Mitch McConnell has always been absent from the fight,” said Dudley Brown, the president of the National Association for Gun Rights, a hard-line alternative to the NRA. “He has never stood up when it was really tough.”

‘An obstacle to taking any action’

For McConnell,<span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 opened</span> with a mass shooting at Marshall County High School near Benton, Ky., where a 15-year-old student killed two and injured more than a dozen others that January. The following month, another school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">left 17 dead</span> and drew yet another national outcry for stronger gun measures.

At the time, Trump offered messaging whiplash. In a meeting with Democratic and Republican lawmakers two weeks after Parkland, he called for “comprehensive” gun legislation and chided Republicans for being “petrified” of the NRA. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But the next day, he hosted an NRA lobbyist in the Oval Office, declared the meeting “great” on Twitter and seemed to lose interest in working on gun legislation.

</span>Still, a McConnell aide said, the combination of the Florida and Kentucky school shootings prompted McConnell, by then the Senate majority leader, to help pass two modest bills on background checks (the Fix NICS Act) and school safety (the Stop School Violence Act).

The Fix NICS Act helped improve the criminal background checks system to make background checks more thorough and accurate, and the stopping school violence measure authorized additional funding for improving school security and early intervention and school violence prevention programs.

Another big push for gun legislation came in the summer <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2019,</span> following back-to-back shootings on Aug.<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 and</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4 at</span> a Walmart Supercenter in majority-Hispanic El Paso and in a nightlife corridor in Dayton, Ohio, which left a <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">combined 23 people</span> dead and dozens more injured.

The Democratic blowback was fierce and directed squarely at McConnell — who was again campaigning for reelection — since the House had already passed a background check bill.

“I hope that Sen. McConnell would bring the Senate back tomorrow and pass the background check bill and send it to the president,” Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown said after the shootings.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">The same day, Shannon Watts of Moms Demand Action, a gun violence prevention group, declared, “We need Mitch McConnell to allow a vote.”

</span>The Twitter account of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) retweeted both statements, and several days later, Pelosi wrote a public letter to Trump asking him to call on McConnell — whom she described as “an obstacle to taking any action” — to call the Senate back into session.

By the night of Aug.<span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,</span> protesters had gathered outside McConnell’s Kentucky home with profane chants. Days later, dozens gathered outside his Louisville office.

That Thursday, Aug.<span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span> McConnell went on Louisville’s WHAS-AM radio to say he had spoken with Trump and was ready to take action. The president, he said, was “anxious to get an outcome, and so am I.”

“What we can’t do is fail to pass something,” McConnell said. “What I want to see here is an outcome.”

He added that background checks — which he said had “a lot of support” publicly — and red flag measures would probably lead the discussion.

But a special session was never called.

The week before returning to Washington, McConnell did an interview with Hugh Hewitt on Sept.<span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 that</span> laid out a different benchmark, deferring to Trump: “I said several weeks ago that if the president took a position on a bill so that we knew we would actually be making a law and not just having serial votes, I’d be happy to put it on the floor.”

By the time McConnell brought the Senate back in session, his focus had shifted. In his first remarks on the Senate floor, McConnell made no mention of the gun issue. Just over a week later, The Post reported on a whistleblower complaint about Trump’s communications with a foreign leader, eventually leading to Trump’s first impeachment for his efforts to withhold military aid to Ukraine — drawing Trump’s attention away from guns.

This past Wednesday, the day after the devastating Uvalde elementary school shooting, McConnell — now the Senate minority leader again — took to the Senate floor to declare himself and the nation “sickened and outraged by the senseless evil” that left at <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 19 students</span> and two teachers “murdered for no apparent reason at all.”

He did not mention guns or any possible legislation, instead focusing on the “innocent young lives” that were prematurely extinguished.

“Words simply fail,” McConnell said.

On Thursday, however, McConnell tasked Cornyn with negotiating with Democrats.

“Maybe this will provide some impetus” for compromise, Cornyn told reporters at the Capitol on Thursday. “This is horrible. Hard to imagine anything that could be worse than parents worrying about the safety of their kids going to school.”

But most Republicans signaled in recent days that major legislation remains unlikely.

“There are no right words to describe the heartbreaking and horrific tragedy that happened at Robb Elementary School,” said Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), before adding later: “We must be thoughtful about how we discuss and handle school safety and mental health issues. Federal changes should not be made in haste, and there’s still many details we do not know as the investigation continues.”

After a vigil for the Uvalde victims, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) stormed away from an interview when a British reporter asked him why mass shootings happen “only in America.” Cruz accused the reporter of having a “political agenda.”

Cruz also dismissed Democratic gun violence prevention proposals, saying that none of them would have stopped the Uvalde shooting, and later suggested legislation to “harden schools” — such as having only one usable door.

On Friday, Trump — still the de facto leader of the Republican Party — joined other Republican officials in delivering a defiant response to the Uvalde massacre at an NRA annual meeting in Houston, arguing that new gun restrictions were pointless.

Support for stricter gun laws has increased after mass shootings at schools. In <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2018,</span> shortly after the Parkland shooting,<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 67 percent</span> said in a Gallup Poll that laws should be more strict — an increase <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 60 percent</span> who said the same in <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2017.</span> Similarly, support for stricter laws jumped <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 43 percent</span> <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 58 percent</span> after the Sandy Hook shooting.

In contrast to support for gun restrictions in general, support for expanding background checks has stayed very high over time. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">A Pew Research Center poll last year <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">found 81 percent</span> of Americans supported making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks, <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 70 percent</span> of Republicans <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 92 percent</span> of Democrats.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">A 63 percent</span> majority supported a ban on assault-style weapons, <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 83 percent</span> of Democrats and less than half as many Republicans (37 percent).

But many gun-control advocates and Democrats remain skeptical that Republicans are prepared to change their approach. Matt Bennett — a co-founder of Third Way, a Democratic think tank — said polarized politics prevents the handful of Republicans who may privately support some gun safety laws to do so publicly.

“The ones who believe in their hearts that they should do something — and who knows how many there truly are — don’t want to do it, because they don’t want to get crosswise with the base,” Bennett said.

John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, latched onto McConnell’s declaration on the Senate floor that “words simply fail.”

He said he agrees completely.

“I don’t want to mince words. The Republican senators are what is costing American lives. And McConnell is the head of the Republican Senate,” Feinblatt said. “I am encouraged that McConnell gave the green light to Cornyn. That is what I would call step one.”

“But,” he added, “There is no question about it: Inaction is not an option.”

Updated Nov.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 6</span>:57 pm ET

An international race to lower corporate taxes is back in the global spotlight after Britain recommitted to slashing rates and as the election of Donald Trump puts U.S. corporate-tax overhauls on the front burner.

</span>U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday officially endorsed a move by Britain’s previous Conservative government to lower the main corporate rate there <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 17% by</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020,</span> from today’<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 20%.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">President-elect Donald Trump promoted on the campaign trail <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 15% U</span>.S. headline corporate tax-rate—down from the <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">current 35%.</span>

</span>Mr. Trump’s plan is far from a done deal. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">It faces domestic political hurdles and fiscal reality.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">And Mrs. May backed a tax cut already approved by Parliament but stopped short of endorsing her predecessor’s further recommendation—made after the Brexit vote—to go down <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15%.</span>

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Still, the rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic represent the latest volleys in a long tradition of trying to use national corporate-tax codes to spur investment at home or lure foreign firms.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The new attention being paid to corporate tax in both places follows close on the heels of recent moves in Japan, Canada, Italy and France to attract investment with lower rates of their own.

</span>For Britain, the Brexit decision has made the pressure to keep the welcome mat out especially intense. The country, in particular London, has been a magnet for global firms looking to set up European beachheads or global offices. It benefits from a convenient time zone between Asia and the Americas, strong legal protections and a large pool of well-educated, English-speaking workers.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">But after Britain’s <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 23 vote</span> to leave the European Union, many companies based there have scrambled to assess whether they will continue to benefit from two other, big advantages that come with EU membership: unfettered access to Europe’s common market and the free movement of labor across the bloc.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Britain’s Institute of Directors, a group of company directors and senior business leaders, found in a poll shortly after the vote that more than a fifth of respondents said they were considering moving some of their operations outside the U.K. because of the vote.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Mrs. May has tried to assure British and foreign companies that the U.K. will continue to be a competitive place to do business.</span> Her charm offensive has included closed-door meetings with corporate heads such as Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Nissan Motor Co., the second-largest car maker in the U.K. Mr. Ghosn had considered passing over Sunderland and picking a factory in continental Europe to build a new model, but he backtracked after meeting with Mrs. May.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Mrs. May’s announcement, made in a speech to U.K. business leaders, reassured companies that she was still prepared to carry through on the tax reductions approved by Parliament during her predecessor’s government.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">She didn’t mention a specific tax-cutting target.

</span>That left unclear whether she would be willing to embrace a further cut <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15%,</span> which was proposed—but never acted upon—by then-Prime Minister David Cameron’s government in the immediate wake of the Brexit vote. An aide to Mrs. May said only she was committed to the plans already in place to cut the rate <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2020 to</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17%.</span>

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Still, business leaders took it as a strong signal of support for keeping corporate tax low.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">“It’s good to see the government reaffirm its commitment to lower corporation tax,” said a spokesman for the Confederation of British Industry, a trade group.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">The plan to gradually move to <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 17% corporate</span>-tax rate would give Britain the lowest headline corporate-tax rate among the Group <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20,</span> a collection of the world’s richest nations.</span> At the <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">current 20%,</span> its headline rate is already one of the lowest in the G-20, equal to that of Turkey, Russia and Saudi Arabia. <span id=""14"" class=""red""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">At 17%,</span> it would still be above Ireland’<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 12.5%,</span> but well below most other large economies.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">It might also be at the limit of what Britain’s finances can stand.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">“Britain has a large deficit and is very constrained on how much tax-cutting it can do,” said Charles Beer, managing director of independent tax advisory Taxand in Britain.</span> He said the government could speed up implementing <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 17% rate</span>, “but it’s hard to see how they can do a major move down.”

Vodafone Group PLC said in the days immediately after the June vote that it might have to reconsider its U.K. headquarters. It has since backtracked, saying it is happy to be British based. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">A spokesman declined to comment on Mrs. May’s tax pledge.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The race to lower corporate taxes comes amid a broader tax shake-up that has played out over recent years.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Almost 100 countries</span>, including the U.S. and most of Europe, have agreed to close—or at least narrow—legal loopholes that big companies use to shift profits to places where they pay little or no income tax.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">EU regulators have also taken aim at tailor-made tax deals between certain member countries and companies.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">“Once those loopholes are closed the main way countries can compete is by lowering their base corporate tax rate,” said Paolo Giacometti, a partner at Italian law firm Chiomenti.</span> “So we will see this trend continue.”

<span id=""22"" class=""red"">It is often hard to compare corporate-tax rates in an apples-to-apples fashion.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Some countries have wider corporate-tax bases, for instance, or charge different rates for different-sized companies.</span> Companies also have to contend with an array of regional taxes, such as U.S. state taxes. Still, the national rate is often the easiest-to-convey message of welcome—or warning—a government can send to corporate executives.

Germany and Ireland made big cuts at the beginning of this century in a bid to attract corporate investment. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Berlin clawed back much of what it lost in revenue by making it harder for companies to take deductions.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Ireland’s sharp headline corporate-tax cuts early in the decade helped it become one of Europe’s most attractive destinations for many companies looking for European or global headquarters.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">But it is also now pulling back on other corporate-tax benefits.</span> Two years ago, for instance, Dublin said it would end <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2020 a</span> gambit it called the “Double Irish.” <span id=""27"" class=""red"">The structure allowed multinationals to lower their taxable profit in one Irish subsidiary by paying royalties into another Irish-registered subsidiary that was managed in a tax haven—making it exempt from Irish income tax.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Italy in <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2015 moved</span> to lower its national corporate tax rate <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 3.5 percentage</span> points, <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 24%.</span></span> That reduction takes effect next year. Even France, long a holdout, has embraced the trend in the past few years, though rates in the country are still higher than in most of Europe.

Japan, struggling to promote growth as the country’s population ages, has been cutting the rate to encourage investment. This year, the rate <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 2 percentage</span> points <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 30%,</span> bringing the drop <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 10 points</span> in just a few years.

In the U.S., however, the policy debate has been stalled for years, despite bipartisan consensus to lower corporate taxes. <span id=""29"" class=""red"">The U.S. rate is now the world’s highest, though effective tax rates are lower than <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 35% marginal</span> rate.</span> House Republicans have proposed <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 20% rate</span>, saying they want to leapfrog other countries that have been reducing their rates more incrementally. President Barack Obama several years ago proposed <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 28% rate</span> <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 25% for</span> manufacturers.

<span id=""30"" class=""red"">Unlike many other countries, the U.S. doesn’t have a value-added tax—akin to a federal sales tax—that it can increase while cutting the corporate tax rate.</span> <span id=""31"" class=""red"">That means Washington has had to look for offsetting revenue elsewhere.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">All the likely sources—a broader corporate tax base, higher taxes on small businesses and wider budget deficits—are politically problematic.

66574421e5b48f8b30994340,28411,"<h3>Pinkerton: Why Buying Greenland Is One of Donald Trump’s Best Ideas</h3>Last week, the Wall Street Journal had a scoop of sorts; the headline read, “President Trump Eyes a New Real-Estate Purchase: Greenland: In conversations with aides, the president has — with varying degrees of seriousness — floated the idea of the U.S. buying the autonomous Danish territory.”
Greenland, of course, is a huge island in the Atlantic, most of it north of the Arctic Circle. As such, even though it <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">boasts 836,000 square</span> miles of territory — more than a quarter the size of the continental U.S. — it counts a population of <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 55,000.</span>
In other words, the great landmass is ripe for development, so it’s no wonder Trump, real estate man, wants to take a crack at developing it — on behalf of the nation, if not for himself. Indeed, wits were quick to riff on what a Trumpified Greenland would look like.
Needless to say, the Journal’s report sparked a wide variety of reactions; the Danish government immediately said “no,” while one New York City tabloid laughed, even as other organs of the mainstream media heaped on their own ridicule. Not surprisingly, one MSNBC talking head went beyond attacking Trump to attack Trump supporters, chortling, “Can anybody at the MAGA rally point out Greenland on a map?”
In response, Trump kept the door open, telling reporters on August 18:
Strategically, it’s interesting, and we’d be interested, but we’ll talk to them a little bit. It’s not number one on the burner.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow added:
We’re looking at it …</span> Greenland is a strategic place. They’ve got a lot of valuable minerals … the president, who knows a thing or two about buying real estate, wants to take a look.
A few others were supportive; Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) tweeted on August 15:
This a smart geopolitical move. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The United States has a compelling strategic interest in Greenland, and this should absolutely be on the table.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Indeed, America’s strategic interest in Greenland has long been recognized.</span> As Foreign Policy magazine noted, the U.S. has tried, twice, to buy Greenland — once after the Civil War and again after World War Two. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">(During WWII, Uncle Sam used Greenland for military basing and supply; to this day, there’s a major Air Force base at Thule, less <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1,000 miles</span> from the North Pole.)
</span>In fact, <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1917,</span> America purchased the Danish West Indies from Denmark; we <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paid $25 million</span>, renaming them the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Indeed, in its history, the U.S. has bought plenty of land, including the Louisiana Territory from the French <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1803 and</span> Alaska from the Russians <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1867.</span> In each case, the pittance Uncle Sam spent was repaid a thousand-fold, not just because of the natural resources involved, nor just because expansive land helped Americans spread out and own their own property, but also because, by taking possession of that territory, we kept a hostile power from possessing it. (We can pause to consider how much more difficult America’s existence would have been, for example, if Napoleon had controlled the Mississippi River, or if the Russians had enjoyed a foothold in North America.)
So now, Greenland is a possible new frontier. The Danes have controlled it for centuries, and frankly, they haven’t done much with it. One reason, of course, is that it’s frigid and, indeed, mostly covered in glacier ice. And yet with the right mindset, inclement weather is only an obstacle, not a roadblock. As plucky Americans have proven in Alaska and elsewhere, we’re perfectly capable of dealing with harsh weather; after all, ice, cold, and isolation are irresistible to hardy vacationers and those who simply wish to really get away from it all.
Moreover, if profit beckons, miners and drillers can always punch their way through. And how much profit is to be had? The truth is, we really don’t know how much natural wealth is to be found in Greenland because nobody has ever seriously looked.
So why haven’t they looked? It’s because the Danes have chosen to treat the territory, for the most part, like a giant nature preserve. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">And that’s why the native population of Greenland mostly lives in relative poverty as poor dependents of the masters in Copenhagen.</span> Yes, it’s an odd kind of neocolonialism there in the North Atlantic as the politically correct Danes pat themselves on the back for their “enlightened eco-consciousness,” even as Greenlanders stay poor.
Yet even from afar, we know that Greenland offers a fantastic development opportunity. And so, if the Danes are too green and politically correct to extract that wealth, perhaps the U.S. can blaze a rich new trail.
Of course, some will say that all this is a pipe-dream, even if the U.S. were to become sovereign in Greenland. That is, the greens in America would work just as hard as the greens in Denmark to stop any such development, preferring to leave Greenland as it is, undeveloped. Yes, American greens, backed up by numerous billion-dollar foundations, would do precisely that: They’d organize, agitate, and litigate to leave Greenland to the seals and polar bears.
So we can see: Green power is not to be underestimated. As a matter of fact, the greens are so powerful in the U.S. that they have, in much of the country, taken the issue of natural resource development off the table. That’s why, for example, efforts to fully exploit America’s hydrocarbon resources have been stymied. As has been pointed out by Breitbart News, the total value of oil and natural gas, under federal lands and waters, <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is $128 trillion</span>. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">That’s a lot of wealth — six times America’s annual GDP, six times our national debt — and yet green power is such that few even talk about tapping into our natural abundance.
</span>So if Greenland were on the agenda, we could at least ask: What’s the value of underground resources in Greenland? And the answer is, simply, nobody knows. And yet we should be confident that the number is, well, yuge.
There’s a good reason — a cosmic reason, one might say — why we should be confident that there are plenty of resources to be found in Greenland. And that’s because valuable elements, and the resulting compounds and minerals, have been scattered all over the earth by the same gargantuan forces that created the universe in the first place. That is, all the naturally occurring elements in the periodic table — from copper to iron, from silver to gold — were created by nucleosynthesis, either as the result of the Big Bang eons ago or by subsequent stellar activity. All that nucleosynthesis has had the effect of hurling gases and matter around the universe until some of it was accreted into celestial bodies, such as our sun and its planets — and including our earth.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">So that’s why raw resources are both so abundant and so widely distributed here on this third rock from the sun; as Charlton Heston might have thundered at his Ten Commandments best, we can behold the mighty hands of God that have whipped treasures all around the globe, including in Greenland.
</span>Now here’s where human mind-power comes into the equation. All through human history, smart and hard-working people have unlocked value from seemingly barren patches of land; that is, they have learned to find, refine, and otherwise gain the riches of the earth. That was the story, for example, of Texas and Oklahoma, a century or more ago: tumbleweeds turned into oil rigs.
Indeed, ever since, the smart and the hard-working have found yet more ways to find additional oil and other hydrocarbons. In doing so, they have the defied most “experts.” You see, back in the early 1970s, savants opined that the world was in the midst of an “energy crisis,” and so we had to cut back on everything and live with less.
Yet in the decades since, in defiance of those brainiacs, we have proven that there was no such natural energy crisis. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The biggest problem was the unnatural imposition of U.S. price controls, finally lifted by President Ronald Reagan <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1981.</span></span> After Reagan de-controlled oil, its production surged. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Indeed, it surged so much that prices actually fell.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">In other words, the free market delivered an unabashed win-win: more production and lower prices.
</span>In the meantime, a whole new group of entrepreneurs and innovators came along, finding new ways to squeeze oil out of old fields; one such was George P. Mitchell (1919-2013), the Texas-born pioneer of fracking. As a result, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1980,</span> proven oil reserves in the U.S. have risen by more than a third, and around the world, reserves have nearly tripled.
So now, looking to the future, there’s every reason to believe that the same sequence would happen in Greenland: new thinking + new production = new wealth.
Of course, the greens would oppose all of this. They would say that they are worried about the puffins, of course, and they would also say they’re worried about climate change. That is, if we extracted and burned more carbon-based fuels, more carbon dioxide would enter into the atmosphere.
Yet seen through the proper prism of informed imagination, Greenland offers great hope for addressing that issue as well. That is, if the concern is that too much carbon dioxide is entering the atmosphere, there’s a simple enough thing to do: capture it. After all, if it was put into the atmosphere, it can be pulled out.
So how, exactly, to pull out the CO2? That can be done in lots of ways, including direct-air capture, as advocated by Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY). And there’s the related, perhaps simpler, idea of planting a lot of trees — call that organic carbon capture.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">As this author has argued here at Breitbart News, carbon capture by any means — industrial or biological — would be a powerful engine of rural economic development.
</span>So now we come back to Greenland. As noted, Greenland is more than a quarter the size of the <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Lower 48.</span> So that gives us plenty of vacant land to work with — to dig, to drill, to otherwise enjoy — and then, at the same time, the land can be used for carbon capture. Yes, it’s mostly ice, and yet useful things can be built on top of ice. And carbon could be the key ingredient.
After all, thanks to its marvelous bonding properties, carbon is the building block of just about everything, and so if we use our brains, we can figure out how to solidify carbon to make new structures — applying, for instance, 3-D printing to the construction of homes, towns, even whole cities. Heck, if we wanted to, we could make a carbon-nanotube space elevator; now that would be the world’s coolest carbon sink.
And if we need energy in Greenland, and we don’t find it in carbon fuels, we would have plenty of other options — if we keep our minds open. For instance, one visionary has suggested creating energy from moving weights around to power generators, and those weights could even be made of ice. (And if the ice melts, carbon capture might help restore the ice.)
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">By this reckoning, Greenland could be just the beginning of a whole new worldwide economic boom.</span> If we can develop that icy island, then there’s the rest of the Arctic, and also the Antarctic. And come to think of it, closer to home, there’s all the un-utilized land in the U.S.; the federal government <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">owns 28 percent</span> of all our territory. We need never touch the Grand Canyon or other precious parks; instead, we can start with <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 61 percent</span> of Alaska that the feds are sitting on.
So let’s give Trump credit for his Greenland idea. Even if nothing comes of it during his presidency, he has expanded the “Overton Window” — that is, the range of acceptable political discourse — reminding us that greatness comes from expansion and innovation, not from contraction and enervation.
One fine day, development will come to Greenland, as well as to other desolate places. Such development can, and should, be done cleanly as well as profitably.
There may never be a Trump Tower in Greenland. But even so, the MAGA spirit could be extended to include the new phrase, MGGA — Make Greenland Great Again.

66574421e5b48f8b30994340,23219,"<h3>Assange's Arrest Was Possible Because Ecuador Abandoned Socialism</h3>The shocking news Thursday morning that the government of Ecuador invited British police into its embassy in London to arrest Wikileaks founder Julian Assange left many questioning why the Latin American country, which protected Assange for over half a decade, now felt comfortable letting him go.
The move by President Lenin Moreno – a socialist in name only who has used his tenure in office to liberalize the country after a decade of socialist rule – is the latest salvo in his ongoing campaign to erase the legacy of predecessor Rafael Correa.
Moreno is a member of Correa’s socialist party and became president after the latter threatened to dismantle the entire government if Ecuadorians did not elect his hand-picked successor. Yet he has all but eviscerated the relationship Correa cultivated with Marxist dictators in Venezuela and Cuba, demanded a revision of the country’s ties to communist China, and led a probe into Correa’s tenure that culminated in an arrest warrant for the former head of state.
This week, Moreno cut yet another Correa-era alliance, this time with a controversial antagonist whose only use to Correa was to annoy the U.S. government and help him cover up for authoritarian acts against Ecuadorian journalists.
“Ecuador is a generous country and a nation with open arms. Ours is a government respectful of the principles of international law, and of the institution of the right of asylum,” Moreno stated in a video message distributed on social media explaining the reasoning behind allowing Assange’s arrest. “Granting or withdrawing asylum is a sovereign right of the Ecuadorian state, according to international law.”
Moreno called Assange “disrespectful and aggressive” and accused him of “threatening declarations against Ecuador.” Beyond Assange’s personal behavior, however, Moreno argued that keeping him protected at the embassy violated international law.
“Ecuador’s patience with the behavior of Mr. Assange has reached its limit,” he concluded.
Ecuador decidió soberanamente retirar el asilo diplomático a Julian Assange por violar reiteradamente convenciones internacionales y protocolo de convivencia. #EcuadorSoberano pic.twitter.com/V02pvvtPY0

Correa</span></span> was among the first on Twitter to condemn Moreno, writing from exile in Belgium.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">“Lenin Moreno, the nefarious president of Ecuador, has demonstrated his poverty of humanity to the world, handing over Julian Assange – not just a refugee, but also an Ecuadorian citizen – to British police,” Correa wrote.</span> “This risks Assange’s life and humiliates Ecuador. Day of national mourning.”
Correa does not mention that Moreno’s government, not his, extended the courtesy of citizenship to Assange.
Lenín Moreno, nefasto presidente del Ecuador, ha demostrado su miseria humana al mundo, entregando a Julián Assange -no solo asilado, sino también ciudadano ecuatoriano- a la policía británica.
Esto pone en riesgo la vida de Assange, y humilla al Ecuador.

Correa</span></span> went on to call Moreno “the biggest traitor in Ecuadorian and Latin American history” in a barrage of Twitter posts. At press time, Correa has insulted Moreno on <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Twitter 12 times</span>, not counting retweets of others’ insults.
Reports and rumors that Moreno sought to evict Assange have circulated repeatedly in the past year, reaching a fever pitch when Assange attempted to file a lawsuit against the Ecuadorian government in October for “violating fundamental rights and freedoms” while he stayed at the embassy. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Assange was particularly offended by Ecuador’s demand he pay his internet bill if he wished to use the service, though reports also listed among Ecuador’s requests matters less clearly related to “fundamental rights and freedoms” such as Assange’s refusal to clean up after his cat.</span> The Ecuadorian courts dismissed the suit.
The Ecuadorian government’s issues with Assange aside, his status as a Correa-era bargaining chip proved of little value to Moreno. When Assange took refuge in the embassy <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> socialism was ascendant in South America and then-Ecuadorian President Correa had allied himself with the region’s worst leftist dictators: Cuba’s Fidel Castro and Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez. Correa had just begun emulating the Chávez tactic of shutting down opposition media networks when Assange’s legal situation made state protection – from any state – a must. Correa took the opportunity to lend Assange a hand, claiming to protect the right to a free press and a win against perennial Latin American leftist bogeyman “imperialism” in the process.
“They don’t realize Latin America is free and sovereign. We won’t tolerate interference, colonialism of any kind,” Correa said of the British at the time.
That language, which often featured anti-American tropes, defined the Correa era, as it did that of many leaders in the region at the time: Chávez, Castro regime henchmen, Bolivia’s Evo Morales, Peru’s Ollanta Humala, Argentina’s Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, among others. When right-wing challengers arose to replace many of these leaders later in the decade, many assumed Correa’s socialist movement to be among the few survivors of the continent’s rejection of socialism because of Lenin’s victory. Correa had supported Lenin vocally, at one point telling voters that, should they vote for his conservative rival, Correa would use an obscure procedural rule to dismantle the government and force another election over and over until voters got it “right.”
It took little time for Moreno to use his presidential powers to shift Ecuador rightward. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Under Moreno, Ecuador reversed policies to silence critics in the media and liberalized the economy.</span> It stopped pouring funds into Telesur, a far-left propaganda network largely controlled by Venezuela and Cuba. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">It has begun reevaluating oil deals with China that may have cost the Latin American country millions, presumably in exchange for political support on the global stage.</span> Those deals resulted in Ecuadorian courts first subpoenaing Correa to testify, then ordering his arrest. Moreno’s government has also enacted presidential term limits to block Correa for running for office again.
Most spectacularly, Moreno cut ties to Correa’s closest foreign ally, Venezuela. In an acrimonious declaration in August, Ecuador’s Foreign Ministry cut ties with the Maduro regime, resulting in an exchange of words with the Venezuelan Foreign Minister in which the latter referred to Moreno as a “liar” and a puppet of the United Nations. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Ecuador’s government issued a formal response calling the minister an “embarrassment” and a “poor excuse for a human being,” and his government “sinister.”
Tensions between Moreno and Latin America’s leftists, who once considered him one of their own, will likely continue to worsen as the Venezuelan political crisis continues, bringing the economies of its allies like Cuba down with it.</span> With Assange’s arrest, Moreno has signaled to those powers that he has no intention of returning to their circle.

66574421e5b48f8b30994340,49697,"<h3>Skiing Kosovo, Abandoned Lifts and All</h3>The flakes stumbled into the windows, gathered themselves and then wobbled on like revelers caught between pubs. At times it snowed so hard I could hardly see anything out there at all. A wood hut. A concrete wall. When the storm finally broke three days later, <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 40 inches</span> of snow had fallen and everything sprang to life.
The timing was ideal. A few hours earlier, I had arrived in Pristina, the red-roofed capital of Kosovo, just as the first flakes corkscrewed their way to earth. It was February, frigid, and a worsted wool blanket stretched across the Balkan sky. I threw my skis into the back of a 4Runner with two Serbs I had hired to pick me up, and we rode south in silence toward the Sharr Mountains along the Macedonian border. In an hour we’d be at Brezovica, the most delightfully dysfunctional ski resort in Europe.
You’ve probably heard of Kosovo but not of skiing in Kosovo. Landlocked between Albania and Serbia, Kosovo was the last of the nations to congeal in the caldron of old Yugoslavia. For years it remained a largely autonomous province tucked in southwestern Serbia, but a full-blown war for independence erupted there <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1998 between</span> Orthodox Serbs and ethnic Albanians, who are Muslims. The fighting grew so ugly with a Serb-sponsored campaign of ethnic cleansing that NATO eventually intervened on the Albanians’ behalf <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1999.</span> Today, to the United States and <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 110 other</span> countries that recognize it, Kosovo stands as Europe’s newest country, an eight-year-old diamond of roughly two million friendly, westward-looking people still struggling to get on their feet.
But before all of that there was skiing, and Yugoslavia had plenty of it, from Kranjska Gora in the north to Papova Shapka in the south. The sport soared in popularity when the Olympics came to Bosnia <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1984 and</span> a Slovenian, Jure Franko, won silver in the giant slalom to clinch Yugoslavia’s first Winter Olympic medal ever. Brezovica, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 250 miles</span> southeast of Sarajevo, served as a backup for those games, but Yugoslavia’s more hard-bitten skiers already knew the place for offering the steepest slopes and deepest powder for the fewest dinars.
There near the Serbian enclave of Strpce <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 35 miles</span> south of Pristina, storms slam into <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 8,000</span>-foot Sharr Mountains that rocket out of the Metohija basin with abrupt ridges and mighty shoulders cupping some of the continent’s most extensive pasturelands. Back in the ’80s, the resort’s hey-decade,<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10 lifts</span>, including five surface tows, serviced nine named runs, though the real magic happened in the go-anywhere terrain of the open north-facing bowls. D.J.s from Belgrade and Skopje kept the parties going until dawn. In the morning you might awake to find so much snow had fallen that even the wild chamois were stuck.
Brezovica survived the wars but not the peace that followed. Throughout the early 2000s, INEX, the Serbian socially owned enterprise that managed the resort, stopped investing in Brezovica and everything began to crumble. One of the main hotels, a graceless rectangular prism, became a drafty concrete husk. The disco floor went cold. One by one the lifts failed, and <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2013 none</span> of them worked. The storied resort was all but dead.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Then last April, a French consortium signed a contract with Kosovo’s Trade and Industry Ministry to bring Brezovica back to life; the plan was so ambitious that many locals weren’t sure if it was true.</span> A group of some of the world’s biggest leisure resort development firms — MDP Consulting, the engineering firm Egis and the Compagnie des Alpes, the world’s largest ski area management company behind French ski resorts like Val d’Isère, Tignes and Méribel — agreed to invest half a billion dollars, <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 410 million</span> euros, over the <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 17 years</span> to make Brezovica one of the largest, if not the largest, mountain resorts in the Balkans. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">According to Jill Jamieson, a consultant who has worked on the finance package, that is the single largest private investment in the country since the war, if not ever.
</span>The scope of the proposal is mind-boggling. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The consortium has until May to put the financing in order, meaning work could begin this summer.</span> When complete, the resort, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 8,000 acres</span>, will be the size of one and a half Vails, nearly all of which is skiable and inside a national park. It will have the vertical drop of a Crested Butte, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 2,600 feet</span>. The number of hotel beds will grow <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 700 to</span><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,000 </span>— three times as many currently available across the entire country. Visitors will <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 100 miles</span> of slopes, high-speed lifts and three gondola-linked villages. Two international airports, Pristina and Skopje, are no more than a 90-minute drive. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">One day Brezovica might even provide a more budget-friendly alternative to skiing in the Alps.
</span>Skeptics abound, of course. Can the next greatest place to ski in Europe really be in a tiny war-weary country so obscure it’s hard to imagine anyone vacationing there at all? Is a mega-resort the most sustainable way to attract tourists? Will they even find enough snow on a warming planet? Never mind Kosovo’s rampant corruption and politics that are so cantankerous that politicians themselves have lobbed tear gas canisters in their own chambers at least six times in the last few months to disrupt their own proceedings.
And yet there is hope.
“If we can do this, we can do anything,” said Manik Begolli, an Albanian Kosovar who worked on a public-private partnership team contracted by the United States Agency for International Development to help find an investor.
Maybe. For the moment, though, I just hoped I could ski.
Seven-Elevens have bigger parking lots than Brezovica’s but that’s where the Serbs dropped me off just after dark as the storm gathered intensity. Igor Nikolcevic met me there in a camouflage snowboard jacket. He <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 42,</span> a Serb with closely cropped hair and soulful eyes. He grabbed my ski bag and led me up an icy path to a pizzeria that he started with his wife, Draginja, and which he named after his daughter, Tina. Tina now lives in Pristina. I could have her room, fuzzy kitten posters and all.
I followed Igor into the heart of the village, a collection of mostly hand-built cottages run by hangers-on who have eked out a living by offering basic services to the few who make it this far. There was the Cafe Braca and Restaurant Ljuboten. Skis lined the racks in a shop called Dane. The main chairlift out of the village, an ancient double chair, stood eerily quiet, the seats glazed in ice.
“What time will the lifts start running?” I asked.
“You mean, if they start running,” Igor replied.
That was actually an improvement over the last time I was here, <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> when INEX was hundreds of thousands of euros behind on its power bill and the utility company had cut electricity to the lifts. All was not lost. Instead, for €7 — <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $9 at</span> the time — the Dane guys would give you a ride to the top in a snow-grooming machine, where an entire resort’s worth of untracked powder tugged at my tips.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">It was some of the best skiing I’d ever had for less than a nickel a turn: an unlimited supply of deep, creamy snow on a steep, consistent fall line.</span> Others just hiked up a small rise with sleds or sipped brandy outside while music pumped from competing loudspeakers. I loved the vibe and vowed to return.
This time, two years later, there was at least the possibility that the lifts might run. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Sometime <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2014,</span></span> as the French were quietly studying the resort’s prospects, a cadre of groups, including the Kosovo Electricity Corporation, local officials and the minister of trade and industry, hashed out a deal to get two of the chairlifts spinning again.</span> The equipment was still old, maybe even from the 1970s, and too unsafe to operate in a blizzard. I would have to wait for fairer skies to ride them.
Igor pushed open a door and the pizzeria sighed a breath of warm air. Christmas lights hung from the log cabin frame and spilled a molten glow on the snow outside. Snowshoes, wooden skis and photographs of wintry scenes from the resort’s early days decorated the walls. A fire crackled in the wood stove. A pizzeria in Kosovo is one of the coziest places I know.
I took a seat at a long wooden table next to a local with an even longer face. His house two doors down had just succumbed to a chimney fire. With no firefighters to navigate the winding, snowy road up from Strpce in time, the men of the village had rallied to form a bucket brigade and fell a flame-licked tree. That saved the village but the house, a lovely wood and stone cottage, was a loss.
“It went up like paper,” said the owner, Andrej Kavcic. He poured two shots of slivovitz, the plum brandy, and handed me one. “What am I going to do?” he asked. “You pick yourself up and move on. What else.”
Stoicism seems to be a national trait in Kosovo, but there is no mistaking that the country is picking itself up. <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Some 80 percent</span> of the population was displaced during the war. Now new furniture stores sit along new highways lined with new gas stations. The Pristina airport underwent a €180 million expansion <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013 and</span> is now the third-busiest airport in the old Yugoslavia after Belgrade and Zagreb. Problems persist, but the country is making strides to protect its landscape, integrate into Europe and normalize relations with Belgrade, the reason behind parliament’s self-tear-gassing attacks.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The resort’s rebirth comes at a time when Kosovo could really use jobs.</span> Drive around the country and you’ll see smartly dressed people in cafes, in parks, in front of stores, anywhere but at work. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The resort could provide as many <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 3,000 jobs</span>, some temporary, many permanent, in a country where half the population is <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 30 and</span><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 58 percent</span> of the work force is “inactive.”
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">But more than that, travel insiders around the Balkans have long yearned to trade the region’s oily image of strife for that of the crisp fabric of an emerging adventure-travel destination.</span> The efforts appear to be working. <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2014,</span></span><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.7 million</span> international tourists visited Albania, up from <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 645,000 in</span><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2004.</span> And in Montenegro, you can sea kayak through the watercress on Skadar Lake or catch feisty trout in green Macedonian streams, both with guides.
Few Balkan countries beyond Croatia and Greece can entice transoceanic travelers as stand-alone destinations at the moment but, collectively, places like Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania can make for a wildly fascinating itinerary. Kosovo wants in on that action. Brezovica may be its best shot.
“Kosovo is absolutely ready for something like this,” said Pascal Roux, the chief executive of MDP Consulting and leader of the French consortium. “Brezovica could be the pearl of the Balkans.”
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Maybe so, but “it’s just hugely important to be sure it’s done right,” said Christopher Doyle, executive director for Europe of the Adventure Travel Trade Association, which champions sustainable adventure travel markets.</span> What is needed, he said, are “thoughtful supporting efforts to engage the local community and protect the environment.”
Across the Balkans, there is little doubt that skiing is having a moment. Ecosign, a Canadian mountain resort planning firm that has designed Alpine skiing venues for five Winter Olympics, has <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">completed 15 master</span> plans for new or drastically reorganized resorts, including three in Macedonia, four in Serbia and two in Greece. A Dubai-based firm in December announced plans to build <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $5 billion</span> “tourist city” with thousands of holiday homes near Bosnia’s Bjelasnica mountain, where the Olympics were held. Kopaonik, Serbia’s most developed ski resort, added a new six-person heated chairlift last year and a new hotel. Poiana Brasov in Romania recently spent €30 million expanding its terrain, adding snow-making and upgrading lifts.
If anyone stands to lose on the Brezovica deal, it’s Igor. His grandfather, Radojko Nikolcevic, was the ski area’s first general manager after the resort opened <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1954.</span> In the ’70s he built a hut that would become Tina’s pizzeria under Igor <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1993.</span> Today the Nikolcevices earn enough money selling pizzas in winter to last them the rest of the year. Now the consortium will level almost everything — the hotels, the village, the lifts. The Nikolcevices will get <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $250,000 in</span> expropriation fees, but money isn’t the issue.
“We’re happy people want to invest in the resort but never in my life have I been as afraid for my future as I am right now,” Igor said. “The mountains are in me.”
Over the next three days a frustrating pattern emerged. Each morning I awoke to another foot of snow, and each morning the lifts weren’t running. The Dane guys weren’t offering the seven-euro special. Hiking up alone would be misery. Still, I hoped for the best.
I lounged around Tina’s watching the snowflakes hit the windows or took naps under a shaggy blanket in Tina’s old room. The Nikolcevices treated me like family. We sat near the fire talking about life in Kosovo. On the war: “Stupid politicians caused it.” On being Serbs surrounded by Albanians: “We never have an argument.” On why I should not clear the table: “This is Balkans,” Draginja said. “Women do this.”
I helped anyway and then serviced my macho deficits by grabbing a shovel to clear snow off the pizzeria’s roof. The electricity flickered on and off.
“There is something beautiful when everything is broken,” Draginja told me later over a meal of tangy mountain cheese, winter cabbage and a Serbian dish of shredded pork called duvan cvarci. “Everyone comes together.”
On the fourth day, the storm thinned into a delicate fog, and, miracle of miracles, the lifts creaked to life. At last I could ski.
I raced out the door. Classic rock blared from the Che & Fox cafe. Vendors jammed folding tables into the snow to peddle Serbian beer, Austrian juices and Lucky Strikes. A man in the parking lot sat next to a delivery truck with a cardboard sign: ski rentals €5. I clicked into my own skis and scooted up to a double chair called Livada, or “meadow” in Serbian. It rose lazily over an abandoned stone mansion called Stojko’s house, one of the few buildings that will remain. A man stood next to the entrance ready to check my lift ticket. I didn’t have one. I asked where to buy it.
“No, no, you don’t need a ticket,” said a voice in English behind me. I turned to see two men on skis. One of them in a red jacket shuffled forward, said something in Serbian and pressed <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3 worth</span> of coins into the attendant’s palm. “Come, come,” my new friend said, and off we went.
Rexhep Krasniqi,<span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 58,</span> had fled <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Kosovo 23 years</span> ago as a refugee and now worked as a contractor in London. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">He had returned to ski with his younger brother, Isak, who had run a refugee camp in Macedonia before landing a job in finance.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Isak was now unemployed but not worried.</span> “We are good at surviving,” he said.
I spent most of the day skiing with the Krasniqis, who explained the ticket system. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">A price list said I could buy anything from a single ride <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 10 days</span> of unlimited rides, but almost no one consulted it.</span> Instead they negotiated rates with the attendant. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">A single ride cost <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3.25,</span> though Rexhep had bargained to get both of us at least two rides for that.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">As best as I could tell a day pass cost <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $11.</span>
Now, new for this winter, workers have installed an electronic ticket-reader and day passes have jumped to <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $21,</span> a fortune when the average worker earns <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $380 a</span> month.</span> “No more corruption,” a local told me later, “but less skiers.”
We picked our way through a steep notch called the Lion’s Gate and found untracked lines through the trees. Wind-powered snow roared off the ridge behind us in great white flames. The snow hissed violently off the bottoms of my skis to form blue contrails. Most of the terrain was intermediate to expert-only. The revamped resort will have more beginner runs.
Eventually we stopped for lunch on a patio at a slopeside hut called Cafe Collmar, where a waiter brought us coffee, brandy and cheesy bread. Rexhep refused to let me pay <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $5 bill</span>. “No Albanian in Kosovo will ever let you pay,” he said, politely but firmly. “You are American, and to us Americans are like Jesuses.”
My last day dawned a piercing blue and the air shimmered with suspended snow crystals. This time Igor and a friend from Belgrade, Marko Nikolic, showed me a wild backcountry run that dropped through miles of open powder into a tight stream bed. Marko, a mountain guide, then invited me to climb to a high point in the resort,<span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,274</span>-foot Pribreg mountain, where we could find the longest, most challenging runs back to the base.
We rode Livada up as high as it went, then I slung my skis over my shoulder and kicked steps up the sastrugi beyond the top station. We gained an easy ridge and made the summit <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 45 minutes</span>. A lift once came all the way up here but it hadn’t worked in years, and the top wheelhouse was completely entombed in tons of feathered ice. The slope below was so steep it gave me vertigo.
Soon all of this would be very different. I tried to picture a brand-new lift stitched into the rock, the sprawling village where Tina’s once stood, and the legs I’d need to ski all those new runs. I had one foot in Macedonia, the other in Kosovo, and five more countries in view.
It may have been selfish, but Brezovica felt perfect as is. We have so many polished resorts already but so few that can foster skiing at its most authentic without any flash. Even more selfish: What do you do when you know one of your favorite places to visit, a secret, is about to blow up? Don’t you long for it to stay the way it is?
Brezovica has to change, of course. As anyone in Kosovo knows, stop moving for long enough and someone will come bury you.
Marko wasted no time. He strapped on his snowboard. I lowered my goggles. Then we both pushed off and floated through a beautiful, broken world.
IF YOU GO
Getting There
Pristina (PRN) and Skopje (SKP) are the closest airports to Brezovica. There are no direct flights to either city from the United States. Check fares on Turkish Airlines, Swiss, Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, SAS, EasyJet, Delta, Alitalia and Norwegian for connecting in Europe.
What You Should Know
This winter will likely be the last to see Brezovica in all of its rundown glory. In its current state, the resort is not for everyone. The lifts may not run every day. There is no such thing as customer service. It’s unclear what facilities will be open next winter. For updates check the Sar Planina-Brezovica Facebook page or the Brezovica Resort Facebook page. The ski area also has a website but it isn’t very helpful: brezovica-ski.com.
Guides
Hiring a guide to help you find a place to stay and arrange airport transfers is a must at the moment. Igor Nikolcevic is neither a guide nor an outfitter but he speaks very good English and can help arrange transfers, especially from Pristina, lift tickets, guides and lodging. Message him through the Pizzeria Tina Facebook page. Outdoor Albania, an outfitter based in Tirana, also runs custom trips to Brezovica. (OutdoorAlbania.com; info@outdooralbania.com).
Transfers and Lift Tickets
Expect to pay <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 50 euros</span> each way for transfers from Pristina. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Lift tickets now cost €20 a day.</span>",,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,4,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,

DealBook Briefing: Does Facebook Have Room for More Than One Founder?
Good Thursday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)
Founders may think twice about selling to Facebook
Selling your start-up to Facebook will make you rich, but it might not make you happy. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, who sold Instagram to the social networking giant for <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $715 million</span>, resigned earlier this week, reportedly over tensions with Mark Zuckerberg about growth.
Brian Acton, one of the co-founders who sold WhatsApp to Facebook <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $22 billion</span>, went further. In a dishy interview with Forbes, he spoke of similar tensions with Mr. Zuckerberg. (Facebook wanted ads; he didn’t.)
“They are businesspeople, they are good businesspeople,” Mr. Acton said. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">“They just represent a set of business practices, principles and ethics, and policies that I don’t necessarily agree with.”
</span>A senior Facebook executive, David Marcus, pushed back against Mr. Acton, writing in a post that “attacking the people and company that made you a billionaire” is “a whole new standard of low-class.”
Yes, founders take their money and make a choice. But Facebook’s acquisition strategy appears to be stuttering, and its newer products may head in unexpected directions with their founders out of the picture. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">That’s a problem: Facebook’s acquisitions have been oases of calm and growth compared to its main business.
</span>SoftBank’s founder has the biggest dreams in tech
Masa Son has raised <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $100 billion</span> for his company’s Vision Fund to invest in tech companies, on what he says is a 300-year strategy. But in a Bloomberg Businessweek profile, he says that’s only the start: He wants to raise <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another $100 billion</span> every two or three years, and expand the Vision Fund’s team of deal makers <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 300.</span> Counting him, it’s currently ten.
That’s an incredible amount of money, and competing investment firms are (understandably) frightened. It’s very different at start-ups, Businessweek points out:
SoftBank has given them the equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet of foreign investment dollars. “You think they can’t eat any more,” says Jules Maltz, a partner with IVP, a Sand Hill Road firm. The entrepreneurs “cram it in, put it in their pockets, take doggy bags, whatever.”
The bigger worry might be to SoftBank’s investors: The Vision Fund will need a lot of home-run investments to cover bets that huge.
Silicon Valley tells lawmakers to go easy on regulation
Executives from Google, Apple, AT&T and more appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee yesterday to answer privacy questions. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“We have arrived at a moment where, I believe, there is a strong desire by both Republicans and Democrats, and by both industry and public interest groups, to work in good faith to reach a consensus on a national consumer data privacy law,” Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the committee’s chairman, said in an opening statement.
</span>But a clear message emerged from the tech giants: Don’t go too far.
• Amazon’s associate general counsel, Andrew DeVore, asked lawmakers to “ensure that additional overhead and administration demands any legislation might require actually produce commensurate privacy benefits.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">• Keith Enright, Google’s new chief privacy officer, told them to “take into consideration the impacts on service functionality, the consumer benefits of free and low-cost products, the future of the open web and app ecosystem.”
</span>Nothing will happen quickly. “I think we might have a pretty good idea what a draft would look like,” Mr. Thune concluded. “But I suspect we probably wouldn’t get it acted on until next year.”

Coming up today
The Senate Judiciary Committee will hear from Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford. Dr. Blasey, who accused the Supreme Court nominee of sexual assault, will testify first, starting <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 10 a</span>.m. Eastern. Judge Kavanaugh is also expected to be questioned about accusations from other women, including one who came forward yesterday.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Steven Mnuchin might talk trade.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The Treasury secretary, who has kept a low profile recently, is scheduled to speak at a Washington event sponsored by The Hill.
</span>The Commerce Department will release second-quarter G.D.P. data. Analysts expect <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 4.2 percent</span> annualized growth rate.
The Census Bureau will publish durable goods order numbers for August. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">They are forecast to have risen <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 1.2 percent</span>, having <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fallen 1.7 percent</span> in July because of shrinking demand for transportation equipment.
</span>Fox admits defeat over Sky
Twenty-First Century Fox agreed yesterday to sell <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 39 percent</span> stake in the British broadcaster to Comcast <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $15 billion</span>. It’s the end of a monthslong battle, and of a yearslong quest by Rupert Murdoch to regain control of a company he created decades ago.
Fox is selling at the behest of Walt Disney, which struck a deal over the summer to buy most of Mr. Murdoch’s media empire.
Elizabeth Winkler of Heard on the Street says it’<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $15 billion</span> for Disney to spend on its fight with Netflix. But for Comcast shareholders, it’s <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another $15 billion</span> spent on an asset that many didn’t want in the first place.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Fed stands up to Trump
It raised interest rates as expected yesterday, to <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2 and</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.25 percent</span>, citing a “particularly bright moment” for the U.S. economy.</span> President Trump said he was “not happy.”
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">So he shows no sign of returning to the tradition of presidential silence on fiscal policy.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But the Fed still plans another increase before the end of the year, and some of its officials reckon avoiding inflation will require raising rates to the point of restricting the economy.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">For his part, Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chief, said yesterday: “We don’t consider political factors.”
</span>For Nike, Kaepernick is an existential choice
The sportswear company’s decision to feature Colin Kaepernick in its latest ads has been celebrated as shrewd marketing. But Nike nearly dropped the former N.F.L. quarterback after he became the face of player protests.
Then its communications chief, Nigel Powell, intervened, report Julie Creswell, Kevin Draper and Sapna Maheshwari in the NYT:
Powell argued that Nike would face backlash from the media and consumers if it was seen as siding with the N.F.L. rather than Kaepernick. And Nike, along with most apparel companies, is desperate to attract urban youth who increasingly look up to Kaepernick; the largely white, older N.F.L. fans angry at the league over the protests are not a priority for those companies, analysts say.
Another factor: Under Nike’s latest deal with the N.F.L., it can’t sell league-branded merchandise <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 2020.</span> That helped it choose to put Mr. Kaepernick front and center. So far, the wager is paying off.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Could Treasuries end the bull market?
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The stock market may face a new threat: increasingly attractive returns on government bonds.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">More from Peter Eavis of DealBook:
Buying a 10-year Treasury today would provide its holders <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 3 percent</span> a year for a decade with virtually no risk of losing any money in the process.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Such a return might seem particularly attractive to investors who believe the stock market is expensive and is vulnerable to a sell-off.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">And:
If companies’ profits continue to grow strongly, the earnings yield will rise and stocks will look more attractive compared with government bonds.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">But corporate earnings growth is expected to slow next year.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">And the trade war may cause corporate profits to moderate even more.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">In that case, the difference between the 10-year yield and the earnings yield would shrink even more.</span> Investors may be more tempted then to shed stocks and put more money into bonds.

I believed in traditional reporting, but Trump changed me — and it should change the rest of the media too.
Perspective by Margaret Sullivan
<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 12,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2022 at</span> 10:00 a.m. EDT
Despite my nearly four decades in journalism, I was unprepared for the moment of no return that came on a July day <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span></span> as a blazing sun beat down on the streets of Cleveland. Walking around the grounds of the Republican National Convention, I was looking for a column idea. I was new at this, having started at The Washington Post only a few weeks earlier. Wandering and observing, I came upon a table of souvenirs, meant to appeal to the convention attendees who had arrived from all corners of the nation to cheer on the Republican Party’s nomination of Donald Trump. I already had seen some gleefully misogynistic anti-Clinton paraphernalia — “Hillary sucks but not like Monica” — but nothing measured up to the horror I felt as I registered the meaning of a T-shirt featuring the image of a noose and these words: “Rope. Tree. Journalist. Some assembly required.”
Over the weeks and months ahead, as I started to write what I hoped were well-reasoned Post columns about Trump’s relationship with the media, I felt an irrational anger coming at me like an unending blast from an industrial-strength hose. Trump hadn’t invented this anger, of course, but he certainly emboldened it — and used it for his own purposes. On social media, in phone messages, in emails I received, the sheer hatred from Trump supporters shocked and even frightened me. One, unsigned but from a “lifetime member of the NRA,” asserted that people like me wouldn’t be around much longer. Another, signed “A Real, True Patriot,” read:
“Though I would never read a manure-laden pile of toilet paper like Washington Compost, I heard about your Nazi column about ‘reaching the masses’ with your fake news to convince people that your leftist Nazi lies are truth. You are a well-trained serpent of the left, following communist orders as you were taught. ‘If you say and repeat a lie often enough, it will eventually be seen as truth’ — Lenin … Here’s what you (slithering, fake-news/propaganda- generating slimy slug) should do: Go fornicate yourself with a large, sharp knife, and then eat rat poison until your belly is stuffed.”
I was called the c-word repeatedly. One reader suggested I have my breasts cut off. I tried to let all this nastiness roll off my back and even found it amusing when a Post reader sent me an email calling me a “venomous serpent.” John Schwartz, then a reporter for the New York Times who had become a friend, suggested I treat it as a badge of honor and write a book titled “Memories of a Venomous Serpent.”
Now, six years later, we journalists know a lot more about covering Trump and his supporters. We’ve come a long way, but certainly made plenty of mistakes. Too many times, we acted as his stenographers or megaphones. Too often, we failed to refer to his many falsehoods as lies. It took too long to stop believing that, whenever he calmed down for a moment, he was becoming “presidential.” And it took too long to moderate our instinct to give equal weight to both sides, even when one side was using misinformation for political gain.
It’s been an education for all of us — a gradual realization that the instincts and conventions of traditional journalism weren’t good enough for this moment in our country’s history. As Trump prepares to run again <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2024,</span> it’s worth reminding ourselves of the lessons we’ve learned — and committing to the principle that, when covering politicians who are essentially running against democracy, old-style journalism will no longer suffice.
Back <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span></span> I was still looking for common ground with the Trump crowd. It fit with my background as a traditional newspaper journalist. During <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 13 years</span> as chief editor of the Buffalo News, ending <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> I had believed that I could listen to or communicate with our readers, whatever their politics — and I was registered to vote as a “blank.” Our editorial board, which I sat on, endorsed candidates from various parties, and I had courteous relationships with officeholders of all stripes. I frequently would go out to speak to civic organizations, such as rotary clubs, in the Buffalo-Niagara region with no regard for whether their members leaned right or left.
At the Cleveland airport after the convention, I interviewed one delegate, a concierge for a car dealership named Mary Sue McCarty, who wore a cowboy hat and pearls as she waited for her flight home to Dallas. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">She had her mind made up about the news media: “Journalists aren’t doing their jobs.</span> They are protecting a certain class.” <span id=""1"" class=""red"">When I pointed out that it was the New York Times that broke the consequential story about Hillary Clinton’s email practices and that mainstream media organizations had aggressively investigated the finances of the Clinton Foundation, she shrugged: “If it’s a Republican, it’s investigated to death.</span> If it’s a Democrat, it’s breezed over.”
This assertion could hardly have been more wrong. After all, the media’s endless emphasis on Clinton’s emails would prove to be a big factor in dooming her campaign. It simply wasn’t the case that the press was giving Democrats a pass.
Clearly, the empirical common ground I depended upon — and believed in — was eroding. Dealing with that growing reality over the next few years would change me as a journalist and even as a person. Some principles and beliefs, I found, were more important than appearing to get along with everyone or responding to criticism by offering to compromise or change course. Journalists have to stand, unwaveringly, for the truth — and if that meant being attacked by zealots who wanted to call such a position evidence of bias, I could live with that. For me, it would soon become a matter of simple integrity to acknowledge that some of the old-school rules and practices didn’t work anymore.

From this new vantage point, it seemed self-evident that the mainstream press was too often going easy on Trump. Well into his presidency, journalists didn’t want to use the word “lie” for Trump’s constant barrage of falsehoods. To lie, editors reasoned, means to intend to be untruthful. Since journalists couldn’t be inside politicians’ heads, how were we supposed to know if — by this definition — they were really lying? The logic eventually became strained, given that Trump blithely repeated the same rank mistruths over and over.
Too many reporters and their editors didn’t seem to want to figure out how to cover Trump properly. From the moment he descended the golden escalator at Manhattan’s Trump Tower in <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2015 to</span> announce his candidacy, the news media was in his thrall. Journalists couldn’t stop writing about him, showing him on TV and even broadcasting images of the empty stage waiting for him to arrive at a rally. Trump had described himself as “the ratings machine,” and for once he wasn’t exaggerating.
As I continued to tackle <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 campaign</span>, I criticized the press’s obsession with the former reality-TV star, yet I was caught up in it, too. I have no regrets about what I wrote, but I certainly was aware that if I wrote a column with Trump’s name in the headline, it probably would find a passionate audience: thousands of comments and retweets, hundreds of emails, requests to talk on TV. And because I wrote about the news media, and Trump never stopped using the news media as a foil, there was so much to say.
In every way, Trump was a deeply abnormal candidate, but the news media couldn’t seem to communicate that effectively or even grasp the problem. Instead, his every unhinged, middle-of-the-night tweet was covered like legitimate news. To be fair, the media was applying a standard that had made sense up until that moment: When a major presidential candidate says something provocative or worse, it’s newsworthy. The problem is that we were applying this old standard to a candidate who was exploiting it for his own purposes — while seeking to undermine democracy itself.

In the late afternoon of Nov.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> Election Day, I walked into The Post’s newsroom with a column already started about Hillary Clinton’s supposedly inevitable victory. A few hours later, I was scrambling, just like every reporter, editor and commentator. My colleagues and I watched the television screens placed all around the newsroom as one battleground state after another fell to Trump.
Tossing away my useless column, I wrote that the media coverage of <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 race</span> had been, as I put it, “an epic fail.” <span id=""2"" class=""red"">They — and I would include myself in this criticism — employed a kind of magical thinking: A Trump presidency shouldn’t happen, therefore it won’t happen.
</span>Soon, word filtered down from the boss, Marty Baron, that I should produce a second column before I left the newsroom that night. He wanted me to write my recommendations for how the traditional press should cover the new president. So, I wrote a call to arms for American journalists: “Journalists are going to have to be better — stronger, more courageous, stiffer-spined — than they’ve ever been.” I filed it, not at all convinced that I’d written anything worthwhile on this momentous night, said good night to my editor and headed out of the newsroom <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 3 a</span>.m.
Stunned and spent, I walked slowly through the deserted streets of downtown Washington. As I neared my apartment, I could see the U.S. Capitol, that seemingly inviolable symbol of American democracy, off to the east. Lit from within, it glowed an ethereal white in the darkness.
In every way, Trump was a deeply abnormal candidate, but the news media couldn’t seem to communicate that effectively or even grasp the problem.
As we would learn over the coming years, the Capitol was not inviolable, and neither is the democracy it represents. American democracy is now on the edge of a precipice. What can members of the press do to help keep it from tipping over as <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2024 campaign</span> looms? What should we have learned since that summer in 2016?
For one thing, I’m convinced that journalists — specifically those who cover politics — must keep a sharp focus on truth-seeking, not old-style performative neutrality. Does that mean we throw objectivity out the window? Of course not. We should be resolutely objective in the sense of seeking evidence and approaching subjects with an open mind. We should not, however, resort to taking everything down the middle, no matter what. Rather than, for example, having equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats (or conservatives and progressives) on every talk show, or devoting equal numbers of words to each side of a political argument, we should be thinking about what coverage serves the public best.
Those who deny the outcome of <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span></span> certainly don’t deserve a media megaphone for that enduring lie, one that is likely to reemerge in the presidential campaign ahead. But the media should go one step further: When covering such a politician in other contexts — for example, about abortion rights or gun control — journalists should remind audiences that this public figure is an election denier.
That’s exactly the model pursued by WITF, a public radio station in Harrisburg, Pa., which decided to remind its audience on a regular basis that some Republican state legislators and members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation had opposed the transfer of power to Joe Biden, despite the lack of evidence to support their claims of election fraud. A story on the station’s website about a state legislator’s efforts to get Pennsylvanians vaccinated was accompanied by a sidebar of text about his behavior after the election. On-air stories have used a tagline to accomplish the same purpose. The decision wasn’t easy, one editor told me, “because this is not the normal thing.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Advertisement
Unfortunately, many media organizations — increasingly owned these days by huge corporations or hedge funds — seem more interested in ratings and profits than in serving the public interest.</span> So, they are extremely hesitant to offend groups of viewers or voters, including the many Republicans who have signed on to the lie about <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span></span> being stolen. The new boss of CNN, Chris Licht, raised eyebrows when he made the rounds on Capitol Hill a few months ago to assure Republican leaders that members of their party would be treated fairly on the network that had been one of the former president’s favorite punching bags. One conservative publication, the Washington Free Beacon, called Licht’s unusual outreach an “apology tour.” Given all this, it’s difficult to picture CNN consistently alerting viewers that a politician is an election denier, even when discussing a different subject. Yet that’s exactly the type of bold measure that is needed.
Media people — not just reporters but their editors and top leaders of newsrooms — also need to take a hard, critical look at the types of stories that constitute traditional campaign coverage. That coverage has historically leaned on such things as live footage of speeches, rallies and debates; on “horse race” articles based on polls or conventional wisdom; and on blowing up small conflicts (campaign staff in disarray!) into major stories. These modes of coverage can have the effect of normalizing a candidate who should not be normalized. They also often constitute a distraction at a time when huge swaths of one party are essentially running against democratic practices.
By no means am I counseling that journalists act as if they are “on the team” of Trump’s rivals. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">That’s not our job.</span> At the same time, we have to be aware that covering someone who doesn’t care about democratic norms — even something as basic as the peaceful transfer of power — requires different judgments about what stories really matter, and how we should or should not cover them.
In making these judgments, we have to relentlessly explain ourselves to our readers, viewers and listeners. Although it didn’t involve Trump, a good example of this came over the summer when the Plain Dealer newspaper in Cleveland decided against covering a rally for U.S. Senate candidate J.D. Vance featuring Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis because of the absurdly restrictive rules the campaign had tried to impose, including a prohibition against interviewing attendees who weren’t approved by rally organizers. Instead, the Plain Dealer published white space, with a note to readers written by editor Chris Quinn headlined, “We reject the free speech-trampling rules set by J.D. Vance and Ron DeSantis for covering their rally.” Quinn was blunt: “Think about what they were doing here. They were staging an event to rally people to vote for Vance while instituting the kinds of policies you’d see in a fascist regime.”
Of course, the press must be just as tough on Democrats, should they adopt similar tactics or start lying all the time or trashing governmental norms. The standards should be the same for all. But journalists shouldn’t shy away from the unavoidable truth: Most of this is coming from Trump-style Republicans.
Perhaps the most important thing journalists can do as they cover the campaign ahead is to provide thoughtful framing and context. They shouldn’t just repeat what’s being said, but help explain what it means. This is especially important in headlines and news alerts, which are about as far as many news consumers get. When Trump rants about the supposed horrors of rigged elections and voting fraud, journalists have to constantly provide the counterweight of truth. We have gotten better at this <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2016.</span> Now we have to stick to it.
All of these suggestions go against the grain of traditional politics coverage. Undoubtedly, this approach will draw accusations of bias from the right; undoubtedly, journalists and news leaders will be put on the defensive. They’ll need to get over that. The stakes are enormously high. Doing things the same old way isn’t remotely appropriate. By now, that’s something we all should have learned.

Sitting before a parliamentary oversight committee last month, two top executives from Tanzania Petroleum Development Corp. declined to reveal details of billions of dollars in gas contracts that the state company had signed with foreign investors. Parliamentarians had a sharp riposte: They called the police.

The two company board members had argued they needed permission from their investors before they disclosed details of the deal. But soon after a police officer showed up, the executives were fumbling with their paperwork, according to lawmakers who attended the hearing—but in the end, they didn’t release any documents.

The executives were escorted out of the parliamentary building and into a police truck. They were briefly taken into custody, detained for a few hours and released without charges.

“Companies must accept the era of secrecy is over,” says Zitto Kabwe, the head of the Tanzanian parliament’s public-accounts committee, who witnessed the scene.

TPDC declined to comment on the police detention of its executives, and Tanzania’s ministry of energy and minerals didn’t respond to requests for comment.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Battles over contract transparency are brewing across Africa, touching on sensitive tax issues among energy and mineral giants trying to tap into a new frontier of the global economy.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The clashes show how once-malleable African governments are fighting for a bigger share of earnings in sometimes-secretive deals, often following the advice of Western groups such as the Soros Foundation and the African Governance Initiative, which is headed by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

</span>The upshot: A raft of legal disputes that have stalled production of some key projects and frayed relationships between African governments and foreign investors.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Uganda remains embroiled in a litany of tax disputes with Tullow Oil PLC and Heritage Oil Corp., nearly a decade after oil reserves were discovered.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The country had amended its income-tax law to introduce a capital-gains tax on the sale of oil rights shortly after the discoveries, prompting Heritage and Tullow to contest the new tax assessments.

</span>Zambia’s mining industry is faltering after the government in October decided to more than triple mine royalties <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 20%,</span> following the advice of Western groups. This compelled miners such as First Quantum Minerals Ltd. and Glencore PLC to <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">suspend $2 billion</span> in expansion projects.

And in Guinea, disputes stemming from government changes to a lease for the Simandou iron-ore mine are dogging the project.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Some experts argue the disputes reveal a blurring between demands for more disclosure from investors and more tax revenue from governments.</span> “It’s about negotiating to get a better deal in terms of money ... <span id=""9"" class=""red"">income, but not necessarily transparency,” says Carlos Lopes, the chief of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.

</span>African governments have found ready partners for both endeavors. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Western organizations such as the Soros Foundation, founded by hedge-fund billionaire George Soros, and international institutions like the United Nations and the World Bank are providing advisory services to resource-rich nations on how to adjust ownership structures and rejigger tax laws for a bigger slice of revenues.

</span>Some analysts say this is a necessary tilting of the scales toward African governments.

“The deals often favor the companies which have access to vast experience and capital, while the governments do not have the experience, institutions or laws in place to manage their natural resources,” says George Boden, an analyst with U.K.-based anticorruption group Global Witness.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The African Governance Initiative—headed by Mr. Blair—has helped Rwanda become the region’s first country to issue mining certificates at the point of export, in an effort to keep conflict minerals out of the supply chain.

</span>In Guinea, Mr. Soros, through his foundations, played a key role in advising the government on its review of mining deals struck by previous governments. This led to the ouster of BSG Resources, the mining arm of Israeli tycoon Beny Steinmetz’s family-owned conglomerate, from the country earlier this year and the ushering in of Rio Tinto PLC.

Mr. Steinmetz has since sued Global Witness—partly funded by the Soros Foundation—which accused his company of obtaining mining rights in the country through corruption. BSG also is in international arbitration with Guinea in a bid to win compensation for being stripped of the Simandou mine. BSG Resources has denied wrongdoing and accused President Alpha Condé’s government of seeking to expropriate its rights by stealth—a claim the government rejects.

Simandou’s current operator Rio Tinto has also sued rival Vale SA and Mr. Steinmetz, alleging that they colluded to rob the Anglo-Australian company of the highly prized iron-ore concession, further complicating the legal battles around the mine. Both parties denied Rio Tinto’s allegations, which a BSG Resources spokesman called “baseless and bizarre.”

In Tanzania, the recent police detention of the oil-company executives capped months of a simmering row at the local parliament over whether the East African nation is getting a fair deal for its newfound vast natural-gas resources.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mr. Kabwe’s fight to make all contracts public kicked off in August, when part of the contract with Norway’s Statoil ASA and ExxonMobil Corp. was leaked to the local press, showing that the state-run Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation, or TPDC, had agreed to terms yielding 30%-50% of the revenue for state coffers—well below the 50%-80% yields recommended by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

</span>Tanzania <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009 signed</span> the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, an effort led by non-governmental organizations to bring contracts to light. Though most of Africa’s other mineral-rich nations also are signatories, implementation has been uneven.

Mr. Kabwe, who heads the parliament’s public-accounts committee, ordered TPDC to bring all contracts to parliament for scrutiny, but the state-run company cited investor reluctance to publicize the terms. It didn’t comply with a Nov.<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 deadline</span>—at which point the two senior TPDC board members were briefly taken into custody.

An official with TPDC said that confidentiality clauses in the deals prevent the state company from revealing them to third parties.

ExxonMobil, the minority partner in the venture, referred questions to Statoil. Knut Rostad, a spokesman for Statoil, said the deal was “balanced and comparable to commercial terms in other places with similar risks.” He added that his company was making a long-term commitment to the country and has already spent <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $1.5 billion</span> on exploration.

But Mr. Rostad said he wouldn’t comment on parliamentary debates or police detention of TPDC executives. He confirmed his company didn’t release the contracts but declined to answer why, given the demands of the Tanzanian parliament.

66690684db06fb05c2766266,30538,"<h3>The Website That Shows How a Free Press Can Die</h3>BUDAPEST — Hungary’s leading news website, Origo, had a juicy scoop: A top aide to the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, had used state money to pay for sizable but unexplained expenses during secret foreign trips. The story embarrassed Mr. Orban and was a reminder that his country still had an independent press.
But that was <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span> Today, Origo is one of the prime minister’s most dutiful media boosters, parroting his attacks on migrants and on George Soros, the Hungarian-American philanthropist demonized by the far right on both sides of the Atlantic.
And if Origo once dug into Mr. Orban’s government, it now pounces on his political opponents.
“Let’s look at the affairs of Laszlo Botka!” a headline blared earlier this month in a salacious take on the only mayor of a major Hungarian city not aligned with Mr. Orban’s party, Fidesz. “Serious scandals, mysteries surround the socialist mayor of Szeged.”
If little known outside Hungary, Origo is now a cautionary tale for an age in which democratic norms and freedom of expression are being challenged globally — and President Trump and other leaders have intensified attacks on the free press.
In many ways, Hungary has foreshadowed the democratic backsliding now evident in different corners of the world. Since winning power <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span></span></span> Mr. Orban has steadily eroded institutional checks and balances, especially the independent media. His government now oversees state-owned news outlets, while his allies control most of the country’s private media sources, creating a virtual echo chamber for Mr. Orban’s far right, anti-immigrant views.
The story of Origo’s transformation from independent news source to government cheerleader offers a blueprint of how Mr. Orban and his allies pulled this off. Rather than a sudden and blatant power grab, the effort was subtle but determined, using a quiet pressure campaign.
Origo’s editors were never imprisoned and its reporters were never beaten up. But in secret meetings — including a pivotal one in Vienna — the website’s original owner, a German-owned telecommunications company, relented. The company, Magyar Telekom, first tried self-censorship. Then it sought a nonpartisan buyer.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">But, ultimately, Origo went to the family of Mr. Orban’s former finance minister.
</span>“When Orban came to power <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span></span></span> his aim was to eliminate the media’s role as a check on government,” said Attila Mong, a former public radio anchor and a critic of Mr. Orban. “Orban wanted to introduce a regime which keeps the facade of democratic institutions but is not operated in a democratic manner — and a free press doesn’t fit into that picture.”
On the surface, Hungary’s democratic institutions seem to be operating normally. The judiciary is nominally independent. Elections are held. Newsstands are stacked with dozens of private publications.
“We would never sink so low,” Mr. Orban said in a September speech, “as to silence those with whom we disagree.”
But below the surface, the system has been degraded. The Constitutional Court is stacked with judges appointed by Fidesz. The judiciary and the prosecution service are headed by two of Mr. Orban’s oldest supporters. Both the electoral system and the electoral map have been altered to favor Mr. Orban’s party.
Other than a handful of mainly online outlets, the Hungarian media has been either silent about or supportive of these moves.
According to Freedom House’s press freedom index, Hungary’s media was judged the 87th freest in the world <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span></span> down from joint 40th <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span></span></span> when Mr. Orban entered office.
The index now labels Hungarian media as only “partly free,” while Hungary’s wider political system, once classified as a “consolidated democracy,” has been downgraded to “semi-consolidated democracy.”
And the fate of Origo, Mr. Mong said, is “very symbolic” of that transition.
A Secret Meeting
<span id=""1"" class=""red""><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span></span> Origo was Hungary’s most-read news website, renowned for its hard-nosed investigations into the likes of Lajos Simicska, a friend of Mr. Orban who had long financed his party.
</span>By then, Mr. Orban’s appointees controlled the state media, as well as Hungary’s two main media regulators. He had given regulators more power to fine and punish independent news outlets, or to drive them off air, yet Origo did not seem cowed.
The site had been created in the late 1990s by Magyar Telekom, the country’s leading telecoms company, to lure subscribers to its fledgling internet service. Over time, though, Origo evolved into a journalistic force with its own identity.
But as Origo thrived, its parent company faced challenges.
Since the start of the cellphone era, Magyar Telekom had been Hungary’s leading telecommunications company. When Deutsche Telekom, the German telecoms giant which also owns T-Mobile, bought a majority stake in the company <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2005,</span> Magyar Telekom was considered a marquee purchase.
But things changed with Mr. Orban’s election <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">He levied an “emergency” tax on the telecoms sector, in a bid to reduce government debt after the global financial crisis.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The tax was also seen as part of a wider backlash against foreign firms that had bought up large sections of the Hungarian economy after the fall of communism.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">For Magyar Telekom, it meant an <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $100 million</span> tax bill.</span> Company executives feared more bad news <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span></span> when Mr. Orban’s government was due to renew its frequency licenses. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Ahead of a September deadline, negotiations would determine how much of the market would be assigned to Telekom, and at what price.
</span>The talks were not going well. Months before the deadline, René Obermann, Deutsche Telekom’s C.E.O., became embroiled in a shouting match with Mr. Orban at a private meeting in Germany, two people briefed on the exchange said.
Throughout the year, Magyar Telekom executives met with Janos Lazar, Mr. Orban’s second-in-command, to negotiate the license renewal and a multimillion-dollar contract to install broadband internet throughout rural Hungary. Initially, Origo was not a topic of discussion.
But that changed in the early summer at a secret meeting in Vienna between Mr. Lazar and two senior company executives, according to three people with knowledge of the discussion. Mr. Lazar said that Origo’s journalists had historically struggled to grasp the government’s perspective on certain matters and proposed a remedy: a secret line of communication between Origo’s editors and the highest levels of government.
Mr. Lazar was careful not to frame the request as a quid pro quo for new licenses, or as a form of censorship. But the Magyar Telekom executives took it seriously.
By autumn, Origo had signed a contract with a media consultancy run by Attila Varhegyi, the former director of Mr. Orban’s party. As a consultant, Mr. Varhegyi had played a major role in turning Hungarian state media into a mouthpiece for Mr. Orban and now his attention had pivoted to the private sector.
Under the deal, Mr. Varhegyi’s firm could call Origo’s editor with suggestions about coverage.
That same month, the government extended its license agreements with the country’s three mobile telephone operators.
Magyar Telekom was awarded the biggest share.
Both Magyar Telekom and its parent company declined to comment on the Vienna meeting and Mr. Varhegyi. But in a general statement, Magyar Telekom said: “Dialogue between the government in office and the management of Magyar Telekom is a matter of fact, but its aim has never been to limit publicity or the freedom of press.”
Mr. Varhegyi and Mr. Lazar turned down several interview requests and ignored requests for comment.
An Editor Fired
Outraged, Origo’s editor in chief resigned, refusing to participate in the deal. But his replacement, Gergo Saling, appeared undaunted.
By <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2014,</span> Mr. Saling’s team had even launched an investigation into Mr. Lazar’s foreign travel expenses. Requests by Mr. Varhegyi’s firm to slow the project down were ignored.
But Mr. Saling was living on borrowed time.
The investigation was embarrassing to Magyar Telekom: Mr. Lazar had overseen the company’s license renewal and discussions were still underway over the contract to install broadband in the countryside.
Mr. Lazar complained about the story in a meeting with two Magyar Telekom executives in <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2014,</span> according to two people with knowledge of the discussion, and his disapproval was quickly relayed to Origo’s management. It was one of several attempts by Magyar Telekom management, and Mr. Varhegyi’s firm, to sway the investigation, both before and after the broadband deal was announced later that month, according to four people familiar with the controversy.
Undeterred, Mr. Saling’s journalists continued to scrutinize Mr. Lazar’s travel. They eventually began court proceedings to request specific travel records, and published several embarrassing stories about the minister’s movements.
But by the start of summer, Mr. Saling’s superiors had run out of patience. Mr. Orban had won re-election in April. Mr. Saling was fired in early June, nominally by mutual agreement.
The decision was ultimately made by Miklos Vaszily, Origo’s chief executive. But it came only after months of pressure on Mr. Vaszily from Magyar Telekom’s management and Mr. Varhegyi’s firm, according to three people at the company.
In protest, several of Origo’s best reporters resigned.
For Magyar Telekom, Origo had become a public relations liability and a political hindrance, and executives wanted to sell.
Flush With Government Cash
<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Throughout 2014,</span> Magyar Telekom held talks with prospective buyers but decided against a private sale. The Lazar scandal had caused a public outcry, as critics accused the company of bending to political pressure. Executives wanted the deal to be beyond reproach, so an open bidding process was announced in <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2015 and</span> overseen by Ernst and Young, an international accountancy firm.
The winner was named in November 2015: a firm called New Wave Media, which outbid two rival companies.
New Wave’s profile immediately raised eyebrows. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Their bid was financed by funds controlled by two banks, one owned by Mr. Orban’s government, and another owned by Tamas Szemerey, a cousin of one of Mr. Orban’s former ministers.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">In addition, New Wave was part-owned by Mr. Szemerey’s longtime business partner, company records show.
</span>Mr. Szemerey had made earlier attempts to buy Origo directly. But by his own telling, Magyar Telekom executives had discouraged such a direct attempt, on the grounds that he would be perceived as too close to the government.
Yet Mr. Szemerey ended up helping to pay for Origo all the same.
There was no evidence of favoritism: New Wave had simply made the highest bid. But bolstered by money from the state, New Wave could afford to pay whatever it took to avoid the outlet being sold to businesses not aligned with the government.
“We did not want it in the hands of Soros, or in the hands of people outside Hungary, or people who wanted to influence Hungarian politics against the Hungarian government,” Mr. Szemerey said in an interview.
Magyar Telekom and Deutsche Telekom declined to comment on Mr. Szemerey’s contacts with Telekom officials, but said the deal had been conducted transparently.
Though nominally still private, Origo now became a vessel for the government. Bought in part with government money, Origo now published news that echoed the government’s stance — in particular on migration, Mr. Soros, and the European Union, whose officials have frequently criticized Mr. Orban.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Before, Origo had struggled financially.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Now it was flush with government advertising revenue, which more than tripled following the sale.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span></span> the son of Mr. Orban’s former finance minister became New Wave’s CEO and government advertising revenues kept rising, even as Origo’s coverage became even more aggressively pro-Orban.
</span>At the time, <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 sale</span> of Origo could have been considered an outlier. Then, Origo became one of <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 31 outlets</span> owned by Mr. Orban’s allies, according to research by Atlatszo, an investigative news website.

66690684db06fb05c2766266,49862,"<h3>Analysis | AT&T’s ill-fated media play cost it both time and money</h3>AT&T today is a less valuable, more heavily indebted company than it was <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016 when</span> it announced plans to acquire Time Warner and create a media-communications colossus that would dazzle consumers and shower investors with riches.
Now AT&T’s leadership is back with a new plan: unwinding the deal it once touted as “the model that wins over time.” The company said last week it would spin off its WarnerMedia unit in a <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">complex $43 billion</span> deal that unites it with Discovery Inc. in a new publicly-traded entity.
John Stankey, AT&T’s chief executive, called the company’s latest transformative transaction “an opportunity to unlock value” — leaving unanswered the question of who had locked up the value in the first place.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">While AT&T insists its Time Warner acquisition has paid off financially, many analysts said the telecommunications giant <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">squandered $100 billion</span> on a dalliance with the media and entertainment worlds that could have been better spent elsewhere.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">“Telecom companies have no business whatsoever buying assets that are outside their core expertise,” said Allyn Arden, director at S&P Global Corporate Ratings.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“This was a business they had no business being in.”
AT&T’s pursuit of a comprehensive telecom-media-entertainment strategy certainly left investors unimpressed.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The phone company’s share price barely advanced during a period when stocks more than doubled in value.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">From the announcement of Time Warner’s acquisition to word of its spinoff, shares of AT&T gained <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 12.6 percent</span> compared to <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 112.7 percent</span> increase in the S&<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500.</span>
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The company’s market capitalization — the value of all its outstanding stock — has fallen by <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 percent</span> since the end <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2016,</span> according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">After bingeing on debt — and eliminating <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 45,000 jobs</span> — AT&T confronts a future as the nation’s third-largest provider of wireless services and the No.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 broadband</span> company.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">AT&T’s latest reinvention also is bad news for many retail shareholders.</span> The company has long paid a generous dividend, attracting legions of mom-and-pop investors seeking dependable retirement payouts.
But shedding WarnerMedia will shrink annual dividends by nearly half, from <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $15 billion</span> to between <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $8 billion</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $8.6 billion</span>, the company said.
AT&T shareholders will <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">own 71 percent</span> of the new Discovery, so they will benefit from its future growth. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But many current AT&T investors didn’t sign up for the often bumpy ride of a media growth stock.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">They want reliable income.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">“A lot of holders of AT&T stock are interested in a dividend.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The stock is going to be a lot less attractive to that class of individual investors,” said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, senior counselor at the nonprofit Benton Institute for Broadband and Society.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">One sign of how widely felt AT&T’s cut will be: The Vanguard Group, which holds the company’s shares in dozens of its mutual funds, including the Total Stock Market Index Fund, the world’s largest single fund, is the company’s top shareholder.
</span>By AT&T’s calculations, it’s already made billions of dollars on its original Time Warner deal and expects to make even more through the union of Discovery’s reality television programming and WarnerMedia’s CNN, HBO and Warner Bros. Studios.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">In the deal with Discovery, AT&T shareholders will get stock in the new company.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Based on Discovery’s stock price on <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 14,</span> the day before the transaction was disclosed, those shares would be <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth $59 billion</span></span>.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">AT&T will <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">get $43 billion</span> in cash, securities and WarnerMedia’s agreement to <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">retain $1.5 billion</span> of its debt.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">The telecom giant already has booked an <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $5 billion</span> by selling off WarnerMedia assets, including its stake in the streaming service Hulu, plus billions in cash it’s received from the business <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2018.</span>
</span>“We’re comfortably above <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $100 billion</span> total value we paid when we bought Time Warner,” said Fletcher Cook, AT&T’s vice president for corporate communications.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Yet Discovery’s stock has sagged <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 12 percent</span> since the deal was announced — and the transaction is not scheduled to close until the middle of next year — calling into question whether AT&T’s stake in the new Discovery is really <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth $59 billion</span></span>.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">AT&T’s math also doesn’t include the opportunity cost of <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spending $100 billion</span> on TimeWarner rather than alternatives, such as building out the wireless network needed for an Internet-of-things future.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Limited by the debt it had taken on in the original Time Warner deal, AT&T this year was outspent by Verizon nearly 2-to-1 when the federal government auctioned off mid-band spectrum for 5G networks.</span> As rival Verizon <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">committed $53 billion</span>, AT&T could muster <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only $27 billion</span> for a contest that will be critical to its future.
“If they didn’t have DirecTV and WarnerMedia, they would have gone full throttle on C-band and spent closer <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $50 billion</span>. They were hamstrung,” Arden said.
For AT&T, the about-face on WarnerMedia marks a significant strategic shift after decades of buying and selling other companies.
The corporate saga began <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1984,</span> when the original Bell system was split into the long distance provider AT&T and seven regional phone companies.
More than a decade later, after Congress passed landmark legislation designed to fuel competition among landline, wireless and media companies, AT&T began a series of acquisitions that slowly reassembled much of what had been broken up.
<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2015,</span> it acquired DirecTV before announcing plans to snap up Time Warner the following year. That purchase was delayed when the Trump administration launched an unsuccessful legal challenge on antitrust grounds.
“AT&T has been an acquisition machine for decades. It’s been instrumental to their growth,” said Scott Cleland, president of Precursor, a research consultancy. “Eventually, that strategy ran out of gas.”
Many analysts say the company would have been better off never having gotten involved with Time Warner or DirecTV, the satellite operator it acquired <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 for</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $67 billion</span>. The strategy of owning both media and telecommunications businesses under a single corporate roof, they say, was ill-conceived.
“AT&T is probably getting out of this, at best, break-even or slightly better than that,” said David Barden, senior telecom analyst for Bank of America.
AT&T’s move comes just two weeks after Verizon unloaded its media assets, Yahoo and AOL, in <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $5 billion</span> sale to Apollo Global Management, a private equity firm. But Verizon’s media mistake was far less expensive: It spent <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just $9 billion</span> to acquire the two fading Internet-era stars <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 and</span><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017,</span> at a fraction of what AT&T spent.
AT&T belatedly recognized that making a global success of HBO Max against fierce competition from Netflix and Disney Plus would have required daunting investments. Facing a choice between doubling down and getting out, the company blinked.
“They decided their core competency was connectivity not content,” said Barden, who thinks management made the right call.
As investors mulled the outlook for AT&T and the new Discovery-WarnerMedia combination, it was clear that AT&T has been forced to abandon its ambitious plans and retreat to its roots as a communications company.
Yet AT&T may finally have stumbled onto a promising strategy, as the Discovery deal addresses some of its acknowledged weaknesses. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Executives plan to devote all of <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $43 billion</span> raised by the WarnerMedia spinoff to shrinking the company’s debt load, which has grown <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $169 billion</span>.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">That should accelerate ongoing debt reduction efforts by one year and free up the company to increase spending on its wireless network and to more than double <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 30 million</span> homes its fiber broadband connections, executives said.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">In the short run, AT&T stock may be depressed as dividend-seeking retail investors sell.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">But eventually, professional fund managers who in the past have been underwhelmed by the company’s strategy and repelled by its high debt load will be attracted to the new plan, Barden said.
</span>“AT&T bit off more than they could chew,” said Jeff Kagan, an industry consultant. “But it remains a powerful, strong company.”",,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,4,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,
66690684db06fb05c2766266,28063,"<h3>Discovery’s departure is ‘shot across the bow’ for Silver Spring, state and region</h3>Across the street from Discovery Communications’ towering headquarters in downtown Silver Spring, Jay Ayaba eyed the line of customers at the Starbucks where he works as a shift supervisor. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">It was almost time for an early afternoon surge, overwhelmingly made up of Discovery employees whom Ayaba has come to know by name, face and order — such as Susie and her extra-hot decaf latte.
</span>“This might be a Discovery rush right here,” Ayaba said, looking over his shoulder.
Ayaba,<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24,</span> remembers how much Discovery’s arrival enlivened Silver Spring. He says it was as if “a whole new community had been built overnight.” <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Now he’s worried about the impact of the company’s announcement Tuesday that it will move its corporate headquarters to New York and relocate most of <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 1,300 Maryland</span> jobs.
</span>“We’re still going to be open,” Ayaba said, “but it’s going to be slower than usual around here.”
Plenty of others share his concerns. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Discovery’s exit will cost Montgomery County and Maryland tens of millions of dollars in lost payroll, tax receipts and vendor sales.</span> It will deprive Silver Spring of the high-profile anchor company — perhaps best-known for airing “Shark Week” — that sparked the suburb’s commercial revival beginning in the late 1990s. It will also force the county to find a new occupant for the landmark edifice close to the Silver Spring Metro station.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">In addition, for the greater Washington region, Discovery’s decision stirred fresh anxiety about structural weaknesses in the area’s economy that hamper its ability to compete for top-quality companies.</span> The headquarters move — largely to be closer to the entertainment industry mecca that is New York — cripples hopes that the Washington region can develop as a national hub for broadcast and digital entertainment media.
[Discovery Communications is selling Md. headquarters and moving to New York.]
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Montgomery’s failed effort to retain several hundred back-office jobs also highlighted the challenges posed by the area’s high prices.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Discovery is moving those positions to Knoxville, Tenn., where it said the cost of living is <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 40 percent</span> lower.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">“It’s unfortunate because this is exactly the type of company Washington is trying to attract: a business that isn’t dependent on government spending and can help diversify the economy,” said Stephen S. Fuller, a regional economist at George Mason University.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“It does damage to our brand and the brand we would like to have, that the Washington area is a good place to do business,” Fuller said.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Discovery executives and Maryland elected officials pushed back against the notion that the company’s decision resulted from an unattractive business climate.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">They said the change was inevitable because of Discovery’s acquisition, <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $14.6 billion</span> cash-and-stock deal that is still in progress, of Scripps Networks Interactive, owner of HGTV, Food Network and the Travel Channel.
</span>The new company would have major offices in three locations — New York, Silver Spring and Knoxville — and it made sense to consolidate operations and reduce that number to two.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">“Our decision has nothing to do with incentives or the business environment in Montgomery County,” chief corporate operating officer David C. Leavy said.</span> “We’ve had a wonderful run [here].”
[Turnabout as fair play? Md. Democrats roast Hogan over Discovery’s move to New York.]
Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said top Discovery executives told him there was nothing the state could have done to prevent the loss.
“They assured us it didn’t have anything to do with Maryland,” Hogan said. “They’re simply going through a merger, as most media outlets are.”
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">But there was no disguising the sobering reality that the state lost out to New York for the high-end, creative jobs — some of which will also go to Los Angeles — and to Tennessee for the low-end positions.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Some technology jobs will also cross the river to Sterling, Va., while several hundred positions will remain in Maryland.
</span>“This is a shot across the bow for this region,” said Bob Buchanan, chairman of <span id=""13"" class=""red"">the Montgomery County Economic Development Corp.</span> “We need to seriously address some of these challenges.”
Discovery’s departure is particularly bitter because it was a homegrown success story, a company founded in Landover <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1985 that</span> grew to be an international powerhouse. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Its exit follows an all-too-familiar pattern in which start-ups take root here, blossom and then are plucked away, often through takeovers, to go to more nurturing business ecosystems.
</span>“We don’t seem to be able to hold on to companies as they scale and become successful,” Fuller said. “Businesses are realizing they get a bigger bang for their buck if they go elsewhere.”
From its origins as the Discovery Channel, dedicated to documentaries and nonfiction television programming, Discovery Communications added channels such as TLC, Animal Planet, the Science Channel and OWN (the Oprah Winfrey Network).
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Discovery was lured to downtown Silver Spring in the late 1990s, when Montgomery County offered an incentives package worth more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $10 million</span> in tax credits, grants and loans to set up shop there.
</span>The company built <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $165 million</span>, 10-story tower. The move was the primary catalyst for the revival of Silver Spring, which enjoyed a surge of development including new restaurants, theaters and minority-owned small businesses.
Discovery’s arrival “put Silver Spring on the map and made it a center of documentary work around the world,” said Doug Duncan, who was Montgomery county executive at the time.
<span id=""16"" class=""red""><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Since 2000,</span> the company has <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">received $12.3 million</span> in local and state tax incentives, grants and loans, according to Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks subsidies.
</span>The company’s departure is “devastating for Silver Spring,” Duncan said. “It is going to be really hard to replace them.”
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">That view was echoed by business owners near Discovery’s headquarter.</span> Half a mile up Georgia Avenue at Crisfield Seafood, Bonnie Swanson was tending to the tail end of the lunch crowd at the restaurant her grandparents opened <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1945.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Swanson said the family business survived waves of economic instability in Silver Spring and <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 recession</span>.</span> But Discovery pulling out of Silver Spring was “petrifying.”
Moving forward, Swanson said, the county and state can’t neglect Silver Spring in favor of other development plans, such as those in Bethesda, saying that Silver Spring had long been “Bethesda’s redheaded stepsister.”
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">Facing the loss of lunchtime foot traffic and Discovery employees who host business dinners at Crisfield, Swanson said her restaurant would “just have to buckle our seat belts and hold on.</span> It’s all we can do.”
A few blocks away, Juancarlo Parkhurst still had a few hours before his restaurant, Lina’s Diner and Bar, opened for dinner. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">He’d heard rumors that Discovery might be pulling out of the area for more than a year, but on Tuesday, he was forced to deal with the prospect of losing much of his happy-hour crowd of Discovery employees.
</span>Parkhurst said Discovery was “really big in helping the renaissance of Silver Spring” but also helped drive rent increases that were straining tenants.
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">“Now that there’s no longer this anchor tenant and thousands of employees, it’s very scary as a business operator,” Parkhurst said.
</span>Discovery’s decision dealt a potentially fatal setback to ambitions in the Washington area to become a major player in the entertainment industry.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">Economists said consolidation among media companies has already helped fuel an exodus in the sector.</span> BET Networks, the country’s largest cable network for African American audiences, relocated its headquarters from Northeast Washington to New York last summer. Executives said the move was part of a years-long transition into the Manhattan offices of its parent company, Viacom, which bought BET <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $3 billion</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2000.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">The company had <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 40 full</span>-time employees <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 36 freelancers</span> in Washington.
</span>Silver Spring is still home to Urban One, which <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">operates 55 radio</span> stations targeting African American listeners. But Discovery was the flagship company for this region’s hopes to secure a permanent niche in the industry.
“We have advocacy media and are the information center for political reasons, but not necessarily for documentaries or film entertainment,” Buchanan said.
<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Business leaders said Discovery’s decision highlighted the importance for the Washington region to promote economic sectors where the area already enjoys a competitive advantage and thus has good prospects to succeed.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">Such sectors include cybersecurity, biotechnology, hospitality and financial services, industries with leading companies in the Washington area.</span> A Silver Spring pharmaceutical company, United Therapeutics, has been expanding.
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">The Greater Washington Partnership, an alliance of chief executives of large employers, last month urged greater efforts in the area to train digital technology workers to aid all of those sectors.
</span>“Regions need to focus on their strengths,” said Peter L. Scher, vice chairman of the partnership and chairman of the Mid-Atlantic region for JPMorgan Chase. “What’s important for the region is to keep its eye on the ball. What are the growth sectors, and how do we continue to nurture them?”
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">The need to do more to promote growth separate from the federal government has become acute in recent years because of mandated government budget cuts in the process known as sequestration.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Economic growth has been weak <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010,</span> compared with other big metro areas, as the region struggles to add new, well-paying jobs.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">The jobs it has added — many of them in the service industry — are often low-paid positions with high turnover rates.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">Among the country’<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 15 largest</span> metropolitan areas, the Washington region ranks last in job creation and income growth, according to data from the Stephen S. Fuller Institute at GMU.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">As Discovery showed by shipping low-end jobs to Tennessee, the Washington region struggles to compete when business costs are a factor.
</span>Montgomery and Maryland officials offered undisclosed incentives to Discovery to offset the lower costs in Knoxville, but the gap was too wide to bridge.
<span id=""32"" class=""red"">“There’s no question it’s cheaper to do business in Knoxville,” said Leavy, the Discovery executive.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">“They don’t have a state income tax.</span> Property values are in <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 40 percent</span> <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 50 percent</span> range,” compared with those in Montgomery, he said.
<span id=""34"" class=""red"">Discovery also pointed to other cost advantages in Tennessee.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">According to <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2017 business</span> tax index, it said, Tennessee ranked 13th best while Maryland was 42nd.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Tennessee’s corporate income tax rate <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 6.5 percent</span>, compared with Maryland’<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 8.25 percent</span>.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">According to the Council for Community and Economic Research, the cost of living in Knoxville <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 41 percent</span> below that of Silver Spring, Rockville and Frederick.
</span>Discovery’s move did not come as a surprise to close observers of the company. It has cut its workforce in Silver Spring by nearly half over the past decade. Chief executive David Zaslav, a native New Yorker who took over the company <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007,</span> has been living in Manhattan in recent years even though the company’s headquarters was in Maryland.
“When the new guy came in, there didn’t seem to be any connection between him and the county, between him and Silver Spring,” Duncan, the former county executive, said.
That was in contrast with Discovery’s founder, John Hendricks, who had close relations with Duncan and other local officials. A West Virginia native, Hendricks was running a Maryland consulting firm before he launched Discovery <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1985 with</span> <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $5 million</span> investment from Allen & Co., a boutique New York investment firm known for its media expertise. The timing was right. Cable pioneer John Malone was searching for content for his nascent cable system, and he invested in Discovery and agreed to carry the channel. It hit the airwaves with an after-school special on icebergs.
<span id=""38"" class=""red"">In time, the network was a giant of reality TV, the home of shows such as “19 Kids and Counting,” “The Crocodile Hunter” and “Dirty Jobs.”
</span>Hendricks lured Zaslav, who <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">turns 58 on</span> Monday, from a top post at NBC Universal <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007 to</span> become its chief executive.
“Working with John gave me the fever,” Zaslav said in <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2006 interview</span> with The Washington Post, calling Hendricks “a mentor.”
<span id=""39"" class=""red"">Zaslav overhauled the company, closing its retail stores, ousting veteran executives and reducing the workforce <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 20 percent</span>.</span> He rebranded some of the channel’s properties, making it leaner and more profitable.
“David is a hard-driving guy, direct but likable,” said Hugh Panero, founder and former chief executive at XM Satellite Radio and an adjunct professor at the George Washington University School of Media and Public Affairs. “He came to Discovery when it was down, and he turned it around. He is very focused, smart. He identifies what needs to be fixed . . . sees the pins and knocks them down, pursuing his objectives relentlessly.”
Malone, who sits on the Discovery board, is reportedly a fan.
“Malone does not suffer fools,” said Panero, who has known Zaslav since they worked together in New York media <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">circles 30 years</span> ago. “For Malone, it’s all about what you deliver. He thinks very highly of him.”
Zaslav was well rewarded. <span id=""40"" class=""red"">He is one of the most highly compensated people in the country, <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">earning $341 million</span> in cash, stock and other benefits over company fiscal <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">years 2012 through</span><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> according to Equilar, an executive data firm.</span> Total shareholder return during that period <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 34 percent</span>, according to Equilar.
The news hasn’t all been bad for Montgomery and Maryland. Last year, state and county officials succeeded in keeping Marriott International in Montgomery. <span id=""41"" class=""red"">They <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">offered $62 million</span> in loans, tax credits and grants to build a new headquarters in Bethesda, where the hospitality giant has been based <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 40 years</span>.
</span>Once Discovery leaves, however, Maryland will be the home of only two <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Fortune 500 companies</span></span> other than Marriott: Lockheed Martin and Host Hotels & Resorts.
<span id=""42"" class=""red"">The loss of Discovery “is a real setback, both symbolically and in terms of local employment,” said Anirban Basu, an economist at Baltimore-based Sage Policy Group.</span> “Maryland is not home to many <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Fortune 500 companies</span></span>, and to lose this headquarters represents an unsightly blemish for the state.”

66690684db06fb05c2766266,58696,"<h3>Amy Klobuchar Talks Health Care, Israel and, Yes, That Comb</h3>There was no real doubt what the first question to Senator Amy Klobuchar would be.
Backstage at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., where Ms. Klobuchar was the first in a series of presidential candidates to be interviewed on Saturday, the interviewer, Kara Swisher, asked: “Do you want to start with the comb or end with the comb?”
“We’re going to start with the comb,” Ms. Swisher, the co-founder of the technology news website Recode and a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, concluded.
“The comb” was a reference to a February New York Times article about how Ms. Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, treats her staff in the Senate. <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2008,</span> The Times reported, an aide bought her a salad in an airport but fumbled the plastic utensils. On the plane, Ms. Klobuchar berated the aide, pulled a comb out of her purse and ate the salad with it.
“It was me sort of doing a mom thing,” Ms. Klobuchar responded at Saturday’s event, co-sponsored by The Texas Tribune. “I didn’t have a fork. I used a comb to eat a salad very briefly on a plane in a MacGyver move.”
The fact that Ms. Klobuchar ate salad with a comb was not the main conclusion of the Times report. She did not mention on Saturday that, after finishing the salad, she handed the comb to the aide and ordered him to clean it.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The article, based on interviews with more than two dozen former aides, also included details about how her Senate office employees who took paid parental leave were expected to stay in their job for three times as many weeks as they had taken off — and that if they didn’t, according to an employee handbook, they would be required to pay back the money earned during their leave.
</span>In response to the article, Ms. Klobuchar’s office said it had never enforced that policy and would change the handbook. She did not address that on Saturday, and Ms. Swisher did not ask.
Ms. Klobuchar, who has previously said she “can be tough on people,” acknowledged — as she has in past responses to reports on her treatment of her staff — that she was “sometimes too tough.” “I can push them too hard,” she said. “I can always do better.”
Ms. Swisher then asked if Ms. Klobuchar felt the coverage of her treatment of staff members was sexist, given that many male politicians act similarly.
“I’m not going to go there,” she said, adding, “Whatever it is, I just can’t waste my time analyzing it, because the stakes are too high, and I care too much. That’s why I announced my candidacy in the middle of a blizzard by the Mississippi River.”
In the rest of the interview, Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Swisher had wide-ranging discussions on health care, technology, foreign policy and other issues. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Ms. Klobuchar expressed support for several policies to lower drug prices, including importing products from Canada (“In Minnesota, we can see Canada from our porch,” she joked); ending the “pay for delay” practice in which big pharmaceutical companies pay manufacturers not to produce generics; and allowing the government to negotiate drug prices with Medicare, a perennial proposal from Democrats.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">She criticized the relatively short sentence given to the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in his financial fraud case this week, citing her experience prosecuting white-collar crime and declaring, “You can’t have two systems of justice, one for the rich and powerful and one for everyone else.”</span> She denounced President Trump for his attacks on the news media, saying he “tweets whatever he wants in the morning but doesn’t respect the amendment that allows him to do it.”
She also said she disagreed with Representative Ilhan Omar’s recent comments about American politicians’ support for Israel, “because I believe you can be true to your country and advocate for another country, whether it is Israel or Canada or Ethiopia” — but condemned Mr. Trump for emboldening intolerance, including anti-Semitism, and noted Ms. Omar’s own background as a refugee.
Asked about a recent proposal by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another presidential candidate, to break up big tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, Ms. Klobuchar refused to commit to it. But she endorsed antitrust action and the breakup of monopolies broadly as “one of the governing principles for ensuring that we have a capitalist system.”
Ms. Warren also appeared at South by Southwest on Saturday, speaking with Anand Giridharadas of Time magazine. Mr. Giridharadas began the interview by telling everyone in the audience who either worked for or hoped to work for one of those tech giants to stand, and then asking Ms. Warren to explain to them why she wanted to break up their companies.
Picking Amazon as her example, Ms. Warren condemned the ability of such giants to, essentially, play on a field they control. Amazon not only runs a marketplace, she said, but uses its vast trove of information about consumers’ behavior in the marketplace to create and promote its own products.
“You can be an umpire — a platform — or you can own teams. That’s fine. But you can’t be an umpire and own one of the teams that’s in the game,” she said. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Break those things apart and we will have a much more competitive, robust market in America.</span> That’s how capitalism should work.”
“The monopolist will make fewer monopoly profits,” she added. “Boo-hoo.”
Pressed on what this outlook said about her philosophical differences with Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running on a democratic socialist platform, Ms. Warren said she wanted capitalism to work better.
“There’s an enormous amount to be gained from markets,” she said. “But markets have to have rules. They have to have a cop on the beat. Markets without rules are theft.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">As in her stump speeches, Ms. Warren also spoke at length about the systemic effects of racism, especially in worsening economic inequality.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">In the 1960s, she noted, when redlining and other forms of housing discrimination were legal, the homeownership gap between black and white Americans <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 27 percentage</span> points.</span> Today, it <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 30 percentage</span> points.
“Race matters,” she said. “And until we say so and attack the problem head on, we are not going to fix it.”
Former Gov. John Kasich of Ohio was also interviewed at the festival on Saturday, as was the Starbucks founder and possible independent presidential candidate Howard Schultz.
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and former Gov. Bill Weld of Massachusetts, who is challenging Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination, were also on the schedule.",,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,4,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,

How a Dog’s Killing Turned Brooklyn Progressives Against One Another
After a sudden confrontation that left a golden retriever dead, neighbors came together online to support the owner of the dog. But then things changed.
Supported by
Real-world ethics question: In a well-used city park, a man with a history of erratic behavior attacks a dog and its owner with a stick; five days later, the dog dies. The man is Black, the dog owner white; the adjoining neighborhood is famously progressive, often critical of the police and jail system. At the same time, crime is up in the neighborhood, with attacks by emotionally disturbed people around the city putting some residents on edge.
In a dog-loving, progressive enclave, where pushing law and order can clash with calls for social justice, what’s the right thing to do? How do you protect the public without furthering injustice against this man?
Here’s what happened in Park Slope, Brooklyn, when real-life residents faced this situation.
On Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3,</span> Jessica Chrustic,<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 40,</span> a professional beekeeper, was walking her dog in Prospect Park a little <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 6 a</span>.m. when she saw a man rifling through the garbage outside the Picnic House. She had seen the man before — tall, with dreadlocks wrapped in a turban, carrying a long staff and often muttering to himself or cursing — and she usually kept her distance. But this morning there was no room to avoid him.
According to Ms. Chrustic, he started yelling about immigrants taking over the park, then grabbed a bottle of what she later concluded was urine and sloshed it at her and her dog. She tried to run away, but Moose, her 80-pound golden retriever mix, was straining toward the man, trying to protect her.
The man started swinging the stick, she said. One blow hit her, not seriously. Another connected solidly with the dog’s snout. Mary Rowland,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 56,</span> a hospital manager who was walking her dog nearby, said she heard the crack of wood on bone and came running toward them, screaming at the man to get away.
Both women <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">called 911,</span> and four patrol cars arrived within a few minutes. But by then, the man was gone. “Moose was bleeding from his mouth and pulling to get home,” Ms. Chrustic said. “My focus was just on caring for him.”
Ms. Chrustic was physically unhurt, but she was shaken. How could this happen in a park where she had never felt unsafe, even walking her dog late at night?
Moose had a shattered tooth that needed to be pulled. Ms. Chrustic posted a description of the encounter on the neighborhood social network Nextdoor, warning others about the man and asking them to report any sightings to the police. Her post elicited more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 280 comments</span> in the coming weeks, mostly expressing sympathy. A total stranger on the forum offered to make her a bracelet with the name Moose on it.
But then the next weekend, Moose developed sepsis from a perforated intestine, caused by a blow Ms. Chrustic had not noticed. After emergency surgery, Moose died.
Weeks passed, and the man who attacked the dog was still at large. People on Nextdoor, working from Ms. Chrustic’s description, posted that they had seen him in one part of the park or another. Ms. Chrustic, who used to visit the park four times a day, now found it too traumatic to enter unless necessary.
She was especially frustrated that the man, who was well known to people in the park, had not been arrested. “You have a person who is walking around the park who is violent and needs to be removed,” she said. “He’s known by the community. It’s disheartening.”
It was a random incident that might once have been discussed by a group of dog owners. But now it had a forum for a much wider community, with arguments about policing, vigilantism, homelessness, mental health care and progressive obstinacy all feeding into a conversation that evolved beyond the crime that set it off.
“It’s complicated,” said S. Matthew Liao, a professor of bioethics, philosophy and public health at New York University. “It’s a conflict of values, between wanting security and social justice. Everybody has a responsibility in some ways.
“There are a bunch of issues here, a bunch of threats,” he added. “We can deal with them in a compassionate way, or a not compassionate way.”
The Nextdoor effect
Nextdoor, which claims an average <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 37 million</span> users per week, started <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010 with</span> the promise of connecting people with their neighbors and neighborhoods. One slogan went, “When neighbors start talking, good things happen.”
One thing they talked about, a lot, was local crime. In Nextdoor forums for communities all over the country, this included suspected crime and sightings of “suspicious” characters, leading early critics to say that what the platform really propagated was white fear. After complaints about racial profiling <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016,</span> the company instituted diversity training for its operations staff and new protocols for posts about crime and safety. But even <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020,</span></span> Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez characterized it as an outlet for privileged white people to vent criminal fantasies about their Black and brown neighbors. She tweeted, “@Nextdoor needs to publicly deal w/ their Karen problem.”
A Nextdoor spokesperson said the company enables users to report any posts that they find offensive or discriminatory, which are then reviewed by volunteer community moderators or staff members. <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2021,</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 1 percent</span> of posts were reported as hurtful or harmful; about half of these were removed.
When Ms. Chrustic posted about the attack, the first responses were mostly notes of condolence and support. People with dogs posted that they had seen the man in the same area where she was attacked — why weren’t the police arresting him? Donations poured in to offset her veterinary bills.
But gradually, other voices emerged. A vocal minority asked why Park Slope residents, mostly white, were calling for the police to take down a man who appeared to be homeless and emotionally disturbed. Others called the man a “monster,” a “predator” or a “psychopath.” As on other social media platforms, the most ardent voices made the most noise.
Martin Lofsnes,<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 52,</span> a dancer and choreographer who moved out of the neighborhood <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020,</span></span> came across the conversation while trying to sell some stuff and was appalled by the vitriol directed at an impoverished man, and by what he called “this vigilante attitude.”
He urged people on the thread to put their emotions aside and consider “400 yrs of systematic racism which has prevented black people from building generational wealth through homeownership resulting in the extreme disparity we see today.” Arresting the man, he wrote, would solve none of that.
With all the affluence in Park Slope, he posted, maybe critics should raise money to help the man, not throw him to the lethal jail system, from which he would most likely emerge more dangerous, or not emerge at all.
Others called Mr. Lofsnes naïve or accused him of mansplaining, or told him to take his comments to another thread.
“It’s easy to say that you’re for prison reform and you’re a liberal, until it happens to you,” Mr. Lofsnes said in an interview. “When it happens to you, you have to deal with it. You have to take a step back, even in that heated situation where her dog died, and say, ‘What does this do in the larger scheme of things?’”
To Ms. Chrustic and many on Nextdoor, the issue was simple: A man who killed a dog and attacked its owner was a risk to everyone. She asked people who saw the man to <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">call 911 and</span> to send her photographs so she could confirm that it was really him.
Though most people on the site were supportive, some of the commentary and messages disturbed her. She was accused of not cooperating with the police; some suggested that she did not deserve a dog because she had not protected hers. “People can be horrible,” she said. “And people also take it as an opportunity to vent. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">It becomes a politically divisive conversation I have no interest in being a part of.”
</span>She worked with a police artist to create a sketch of the man, even though part of his face had been covered during the attack. The sketch went up on Nextdoor, and police officers posted it in the park, prompting more reports of sightings.
For Nicole Haddad, who stopped going to the park with her pitbull-vizsla mix, Kingsley, after he was the victim of a similar attack three years ago, Ms. Chrustic’s posts hit home. Since then, Ms. Haddad said, Kingsley has been fearful and sometimes aggressive and has needed expensive behavioral specialists and anti-anxiety medication.
“When I read Jessica’s post, I got really, really triggered,” she said. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">“I just knew the journey that Jessica was going to be in for, because it’s caused me emotional and financial duress.</span> I reached out to her immediately.” The two women compared information and concluded that their dogs were attacked by the same man. To the people who focused more on social justice than removing a threat, Ms. Haddad said: “I tell those people to shut up. They don’t have a leg to stand on.
“I don’t care that it’s being divisive, and that people don’t want to see this guy die in Rikers Island,” Ms. Haddad added. “I’m a New York liberal. I am absolutely for people getting the help they need. But this person is attacking people and killing dogs. He’s targeting women and dogs. He’s violent. He should not be in the park. He should be locked up and paying for his actions.”
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Don’t be a cop, Kris
Kristian Nammack,<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 59,</span> who works in sustainable financing, read the Moose posts on Nextdoor and grew frustrated that nothing seemed to be happening.</span> So he decided to do something about it. He invited people on Nextdoor and Meetup to form a neighborhood watch group to “take our neighborhood back.” As an enticement, he created a logo and <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">printed 10 T</span>-shirts. “We may also get to wear cool berets,” his solicitation offered, nodding to the Guardian Angels, an anti-crime “safety patrol” prominent in the ’70s and ’80s.
Mr. Nammack’s name for the new group: Park Slope Panthers.
He did not see the backlash coming.
“In my mind it was getting people to provide some visibility of community members in the park, especially at hours when women feel vulnerable, <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">like 6 to</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 9,</span>” he said. “Not vigilantes, not with guns, not with the intention to tackle an attacker, but just to be another physical presence. I think just a presence deters crime.”
Mr. Nammack, who was involved in ACT UP and Occupy Sandy, presents himself as a soft-spoken voice of reason, with a Quaker background and a longstanding commitment to progressive causes. He was surprised suddenly to be embraced by people to the right of him. He said he was invited to appear on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” and to meet with Curtis Sliwa, the Guardian Angels founder who ran a tough-on-crime campaign for mayor. Flustered, he declined both.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Then there was the group’s name, which was an immediate flash point: a white financial services guy using the Panther name to take action against a Black man.</span> At the group’s first and only meeting, the scattering of potential volunteers was met by a group of four people, all white, who showed up to disrupt the proceedings.
As described in the news site Hell Gate and the newsletter Common Sense, things went awry almost from the start. A man calling himself Snow told the group, “We are super not into you guys having your meeting, or doing anything in the park,” according to Hell Gate. “The opposite of what we need right now is more cops in this park and more people who want to be helping the cops in this park, when people are already being, like, chased down by the cops.”
To the delight of people who enjoy making fun of Park Slope liberals, one of the disrupters, a woman calling herself Sky, said, “Crime is an abstract term that means nothing in a lot of ways,” according to Common Sense.
A few days after the meeting, someone spray-painted the sidewalk outside Mr. Nammack’s apartment: “Don’t Be a Cop, Kris.” It rattled him. “Even being gay, I don’t know that I’ve ever been the target of hate,” he said. “I felt that I was the target of hate.” He decided he did not have the time or energy to continue the group.
On Nextdoor, people seemed to be dug into their positions. Many bundled the lack of an arrest with the rise of other crimes in the neighborhood. Serious crimes in the 78th Precinct, which includes Park Slope, are <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 50 percent</span> from two years ago, though well below the highs of the early 1990s.
A spokesperson for the Police Department said they were conducting canvasses of the park but would not comment on why there had been no arrest. At a virtual town meeting, Capt. Frantz Souffrant noted that numerous people in the area wear dreadlocks and carry staves. Ms. Rowland — the woman who witnessed the assault — went on at least three rides with officers to confirm a sighting. Each time the person was gone, or it was the wrong man.
Both Ms. Chrustic and Mr. Nammack separately appealed to their representative on the City Council, Shahana Hanif, for help, but they came away feeling her staff members were more concerned with the safety of the man — whom they presumed to be homeless and mentally ill — than with the threat he might pose to others.
Mr. Nammack said he was told: “‘We don’t want the police involved in this.’” He said, “They didn’t seem concerned that there was a public safety threat with this man at large, and that he needs to be dealt with. The bigger concern was keeping this man out of Rikers, and let’s not do anything.”
Under New York law, depending on the level of cruelty, killing a dog can be a misdemeanor or a felony, carrying a prison sentence of up to two years. Michael Whitesides, a spokesperson for Ms. Hanif, called the situation complicated. “We don’t believe that the N.Y.P.D. is the vehicle to bring safety to our community,” Mx. Whitesides said. “When it comes to this individual, they’re clearly a present danger to others and most likely themselves, and figuring out how we can safely de-escalate that situation without putting anyone else in danger is complicated.”
The debate, Mx. Whitesides said, was simply what happens when progressive priorities clash. “Even among the progressives, everyone wants to be safe,” they said. “These debates in the community, while they can feel very tense — this is how we find a solution. It’s going to come through neighbors talking to neighbors.”
Can you support social justice and the police?
On a recent afternoon, nearly two months after the attack, the park was a 526-acre sanctuary from social media and liberal hand-wringing, its tree-lined paths and open fields indifferent to the disputations among its users. Schoolchildren, let out into the exquisite early fall afternoon, fanned excitedly over the gently sloping lawn, as a police cruiser idled nearby, its misery lights flashing. The park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who designed Central Park, both connects and separates the disparate neighborhoods around it.
Ms. Chrustic was willing to talk on a bench outside the park, but not to enter within. Like Mr. Nammack, she felt compelled to stress her progressive bona fides, including volunteer work she’d done for homeless organizations. She wore the M-O-O-S-E bracelet given to her through Nextdoor. “And I don’t even wear bracelets usually,” she said.
She said she still had not moved Moose’s bed or food bowls in her apartment.
“I’m very empathetic toward people who are unhoused and are having hard times and who have mental illness,” she said. “I think that there should be more resources for them. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">There should be more housing situations.</span> But what I emphasize is that this is just one person who needs to be removed from the park. He’s violent. End of story.”
For two months, she has grown increasingly impatient with the police, local officials and neighbors on Nextdoor who seemed more concerned about her attacker’s welfare than her safety.
“Are they waiting for somebody to die?” she said. “Are they waiting for someone to get hurt more severely? I was lucky. My dog was not. What happens to the next person? What happens if it’s a child? How many more people need to be harmed?”
Mr. Nammack, for his part, had come to see his failed effort to start a community watch group, and the disastrous meetup, as a successful exercise in democracy. He had solicited a range of viewpoints, and he got them. “The Saturday meeting, looking back, it was great,” he said. “It brought up a lot of issues. It was quite diverse. It left more open questions than answers. They’re all good questions, but I don’t have the bandwidth to answer. So I feel like I opened a can of worms, and I’m walking away from it.”
For now, he was urging people to sign a petition on Change.org, demanding that Mayor Eric Adams “take appropriate action to rectify this matter.” More <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 600 people</span> have signed the petition.
But Mr. Nammack was not done. After a brief ban from Nextdoor, which was never explained, he returned to the fray. Once again he posted the police sketch of Ms. Chrustic’s attacker, above the headline: STILL AT LARGE. PROSPECT PARK VAGRANT. VIOLENT AND SOCIOPATHIC.
Twenty-seven people clicked that they liked the post. Then Mr. Nammack’s posts were removed again.

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 12,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014 12</span>:59 pm ET

NORFOLK, Va.—With J.C. Penney Co. and Sears Holdings Corp. racing to close stores, America's weakest malls are being pushed to the brink.

Nearly half of <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1,050 indoor</span> and open air malls in the U.S. have both of those struggling chains as anchor tenants, according to real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Of those malls, nearly a quarter are struggling with sales <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $300 per</span> square foot and vacancy rates <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 20%,</span> meaning they will have a hard time finding new tenants if old ones leave.

</span>For an already-weakened mall industry, the negative turn for two once-reliable anchors is promising more stress at a time when the Internet is steadily stealing traffic. And the pressure is only growing. Sears Chief Executive Eddie Lampert this week said he plans to close more stores to help return the company to profitability.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Vacancy rates rose and sales plunged at the Gallery at Military Circle, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 5 miles</span> from downtown Norfolk, Va., after the Sears store closed its doors two years ago.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Eventually the mall's owner missed multiple payments on its debt.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Remaining retail tenants worry about what will happen when the Penney store closes this month, darkening another corner of the 44-year-old property.

</span>Bruce Van, who manages Gent's, a locally owned boutique specializing in men's suits and fedoras and Sunday church clothes, said foot traffic fell by more than half after the Sears closed.

""When J.C. Penney goes out in May, it's going to be bad,"" said Mr. Van, who is also pastor at Rivers of Life Fellowship in Hampton, Va.

The first U.S. indoor mall opened in Edina, Minn., <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1956,</span> and construction peaked in the 1980s. Only six new malls have been built <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010,</span> according to CoStar Group, a provider of commercial real-estate information. Meanwhile, the number of ""dead malls,"" those with vacancy rates <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 40%,</span> has nearly tripled <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2006 to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 74 properties</span>.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The fate of the mall business matters, because even as the industry struggles, it remains an important source of economic activity.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Sales per square foot at the nation's malls grew <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 2.6% last</span> year—their slowest pace <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2009,</span> according to International Council of Shopping Centers.</span> Vacancy rates are stubbornly high, at an average of more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 8% at</span> regional malls, not far off <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2011 peak</span> in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 9.4%,</span> according to data company Reis Inc.

""Just because people are making fewer trips to the mall doesn't mean they're spending less,"" said Jesse Tron, a spokesman for the ICSC. Mr. Tron said that malls are trying to reinvent themselves by adding entertainment like indoor golf courses and higher-end restaurants, as well as services such as same-day delivery.

Still, it is tough to reverse such high vacancy rates when large anchor-tenant retailers like Sears and Penney are closing stores and others like Macy's Inc. are opening fewer locations.

Penney, which racked <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up $2.4 billion</span> in losses over the past two years, plans to <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">close 33 of</span> its stores, most of them in malls. Sears, with losses <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $2.3 billion</span> over the same period, has <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">closed 116 of</span> its full-line Sears stores <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010.</span> Penney and Sears declined to comment.

To be sure, the exit of a troubled retailer can create an opportunity for stronger malls to find healthier tenants. But it is a different situation for struggling malls. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">And the potential damage from losing an anchor tenant is especially high in malls that have both Penney and Sears as tenants, said Gary Balter, a retail analyst with Credit Suisse.</span> ""If one of them goes, it almost forces the other one out, because the mall just won't get enough traffic,"" Mr. Balter said.

The exit of an anchor can cause other stores to leave or renegotiate their leases, contributing to a spiral of declining traffic and investment.

At the Gallery at Military Circle, the cavernous,<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 128,000</span>-square-foot space once occupied by Sears remains empty. ""For Lease"" posters dot the windows of other darkened storefronts.

The mall's situation is already tenuous. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">In November, and again in February and April, Thor Equities LLC, its owner, missed payments on <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $53 million</span> securitized loan, and Thor is in talks to restructure the debt, according to Trepp LLC, a company that collects data on real-estate debt.

</span>The Gallery is hanging on to its other anchors—Macy's at the north end and an 18-screen Cinemark Holdings Inc. movie theater on the south. A Macy's spokesman said the retailer has no plans to leave. Cinemark didn't return calls seeking comment.

At the Southlake Mall in Morrow, Ga., after the Penney there closed in <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2011,</span> a number of national-chain tenants had their rent payments reduced, real-estate executives said. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The mall's total sales fell <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $58 million</span> in January <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $60 million</span> in the year Penney closed as vacancies rose.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Several retailers at the mall said their sales have fallen <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 30% since</span> Penney left.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">""J.C. Penney brought people to the mall,"" said Joseph Nguyen, who operates a jewelry-repair kiosk near the food court and was one of the retailers whose sales fell off.

</span>Southlake occupied what was considered prime real estate in suburban Clayton County when the property was built just off <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Interstate 75 in</span><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1976.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Housing developments were springing up as the city expanded southward, bringing in new residents and eager shoppers.

</span>Over the past decade, however, Southlake's fortunes have turned. Newer shopping destinations in neighboring Henry County pulled customers away. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Clayton County lost jobs when a nearby Ford Motor Co. plant closed <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006.</span></span> The mall took a further hit when Clayton County dropped bus service two years ago.

Southlake lost its first anchor <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003,</span> when Macy's closed one of its two stores at the mall. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Unable to find another retail tenant, General Growth Properties, which bought the mall <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1997,</span> turned the space into offices and a convention center.</span> General Growth filed for <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Chapter 11 bankruptcy</span> protection <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009 and</span> emerged <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span> A year later, Penney left Southlake mall.

While the mall's occupancy rate has remained <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 90%,</span> Southlake has lost several national players, including The Limited and Gap clothing chains and the Chick-fil-A fast-food restaurant.

""Two anchors aren't enough to draw people to the mall,"" said Michelle Laidig, who has worked at Southlake <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 25 years</span>. ""The mall used to be a destination. Now the locals just come here to return items they bought at other malls.""

The future may be turning around. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Vintage Real Estate LLC, which acquires and redevelops underperforming malls, bought Southlake in April for an undisclosed price and plans to <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">invest $3 million</span> to revitalize the property.

</span>""We talked to every tenant,"" Vintage Chairman Fred Sands said. ""We found out how they are doing and what the facility needs.""

Mr. Sands said he is negotiating with new restaurants for the food court and is interviewing tenants to take over the former Penney space.

The chairman disputes the idea that the mall was hurt by Penney's closing. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Sales excluding newly opened or closed stores have held steady at <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $320 per</span> square foot <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2011,</span> according to documents Mr. Sands provided.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Lost business from Penney was offset by increased sales from the mall'<span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 16 shoe</span> retailers, including Foot Locker and Athlete's Foot, he said.

</span>RaeQuel Fagin, a 20-year-old-restaurant worker who met a friend at the food court on a recent Tuesday afternoon, said the mall was a good place to come for sneaker releases, but not for much else.

""I wouldn't say this is where I would come if I felt like shopping,"" Ms. Fagin said.

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 8,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 2</span>:27 am ET

Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, said hackers stole more <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $40 million</span> worth of bitcoin from its platform in what it called a “large scale security breach.”

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The theft offers another example of the vulnerability facing cryptocurrencies and the venues where investors trade them.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Yet the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies barely budged after the robbery was disclosed Wednesday morning in Asia.

</span>Binance said it discovered Tuesday <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 7,000 bitcoins</span> were stolen from a single wallet, amounting to <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 2% of</span> the company’s total bitcoin holdings.

Hackers used phishing, viruses and other techniques, the company said. Binance said they had obtained information about multiple users, including two-factor authentication codes. Industry participants said they believed it was the first major breach at Binance.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Binance, which was founded in China but now operates outside the country, said it was suspending deposits and withdrawals for one week while it conducts a security review, although users will still be able to trade existing funds.</span> Stolen funds would be refunded through its emergency insurance account, the company said.

“The hackers had the patience to wait, and execute well-orchestrated actions through multiple seemingly independent accounts at the most opportune time,” Binance said. “The transaction is structured in a way that [it] passed our existing security checks. It was unfortunate that we were not able to block this withdrawal before it was executed.”

In a video posted on Twitter following the disclosed hack, Changpeng Zhao, chief executive at Binance, described the incident as “a very advanced, persistent hacking effort.” <span id=""4"" class=""red"">He said trading might need to be halted “for a couple of hours here and there” due to system upgrades.

</span>He said Binance has the funds to back the stolen amount. “It does hurt very much but we are able to cover that,” he said in the video. “We are not short on funds right now,” he added.

Hacks were a primary reason for bitcoin’s steep fall last year following its manic rally <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">While bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, is up more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 50% so</span> far this year, it remains down by <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 70% from</span> its record high in <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2017.</span>

</span>“People are quite used to exchange hacks,” said John Patrick Mullin, a cryptocurrency investor and blockchain consultant in Hong Kong. “Markets didn’t move nearly as much as they would’ve one year ago if the same thing happened.”

Bitcoin recently traded <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $5,800,</span> according to CoinDesk.

Cryptocurrency exchanges and investors are often targeted by hackers. More <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1.7 billion</span> has been publicly reported stolen over the years, mostly from exchanges in Asia, including Japanese platforms Mt. Gox and Coincheck.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Last month, the New York attorney general’s office said an exchange called Bitfinex had covered up a loss <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $850 million</span> of corporate and customer funds by using the reserves of the digital currency it controls, tether.

</span>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies exist on independent networks and operate on the blockchain, a public record of transactions. In an effort to replicate the anonymity of physical cash, those transactions aren’t connected to an identity. The anonymity is appealing to bitcoin proponents but is also attractive to hackers and makes it tough to catch thieves.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">“Hacking risks are part of the business reality for crypto exchanges,” said Henri Arslanian, global crypto leader at PwC. “While crypto exchanges are becoming increasingly better prepared, hackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated as well.”

Anheuser-Busch InBev NV still has a way to go in its quest to woo increasingly fickle American drinkers.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The brewer behind Budweiser and Bud Light on Thursday said U.S. revenue <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 3.1% in</span> the second quarter on the back of lower volumes, as both brands continued to lose market share.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The weak performance was a factor in the company missing overall sales growth forecasts, prompting shares to drop more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 5%.</span>

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Sales of the two brands have fallen as once-loyal American consumers shift away from domestic lagers toward craft beers, Mexican imports, wine and spirits.

</span>In response, the company is trying to persuade consumers to buy more expensive beers, rolling out Michelob Ultra Pure Gold, made with organic grains, and Bud Light Orange, brewed with citrus peels. It also plans to launch pricier variants of Budweiser, including a beer aged on bourbon barrel staves, due to begin selling next month.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">On Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Felipe Dutra said there was “no silver bullet, no short term answer to some of the problems we face,” in the U.S., although he added the company’s efforts to innovate and go upmarket were bearing fruit.

</span>AB InBev pointed to some signs of improvement, noting quarterly share losses in the U.S. had slowed, with <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.35 percentage</span> point drop in the last quarter its best quarterly performance in almost four years. It said Michelob Ultra—marketed as a beer for people with an active lifestyle—continued to perform well.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Overall, AB InBev reported a jump in net profit <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1.94 billion</span> for the three months to <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 30,</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $1.5 billion</span> a year earlier, as lower costs helped offset <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1.2% fall</span> in revenue <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $14.01 billion</span>.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Stripping out currency changes and acquisitions, sales <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">grew 4.7%,</span> missing analyst estimates for growth <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 5.4%.</span></span> Shares <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 4.2% in</span> Brussels following the results.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">While some multinationals have said tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are pushing up costs, Mr. Dutra said AB InBev’s costs haven’t risen yet as the company is still protected by hedges.</span> It will begin to feel the impact from these next year.

Outside of the U.S., results were buoyed by Brazil, Mexico, China and Western Europe, helped by the soccer World Cup in Russia, and AB InBev’s efforts to sell pricier drinks.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The World Cup didn’t help sales in the U.S., where viewership was lower than for past tournaments as a result of the American team’s failure to qualify.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">AB InBev said its sponsorship of the soccer tournament was an opportunity to boost sales of Budweiser in international markets as revenue for the beer outside of the U.S. was up by more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10%.</span>

</span>Volume growth in Brazil was slightly hampered by a truck strike, offsetting gains from the World Cup.

The company also announced some organizational changes to spur growth.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">It will combine ZX Ventures, a unit founded <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 to</span> develop new products for emerging consumer needs, with its marketing arm.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The innovation unit in April bought a U.K.-based spirits, e-commerce and import business.

</span>“In order to continue to grow, we have anticipate the future,” said Chief Executive Carlos Brito on a call with investors. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Bringing the two units together “will help us achieve our objective of anticipating market and consumers trends,” he added.

</span>AB InBev is also creating a new position: a head of nonalcoholic beverages. Millennials and so-called “Generation Z” are drinking less than older generations, spurring booze makers to launch more low-alcohol and nonalcoholic products.

Nonalcoholic drinks—which mostly include energy drinks and nonalcoholic beers—make up more <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10% of</span> AB InBev’s volumes.

The company is also restructuring its management, collapsing nine geographical divisions into six in a move it said would help it become more agile following its integration of SABMiller, the London-based brewing giant it acquired <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span>

We can definitely see some advantages. A quick programming note: The <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Health 202 is</span> publishing three days this week. But we’ll be back to our regular schedule next week — see you Monday!

Today’s edition: Nearly half of adults give the U.S. health system a poor or failing grade, per a new report. Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) is rolling out a new campaign critical of drug middlemen. But first ...

Abortion access is at stake in GOP-run states that could elect Democratic governors

The future of abortion access in a handful of battleground states may rest with who wins the governor’s mansion in November.

Democrats are leaning into that message on the campaign trail, seeking to make the November elections a referendum on what they describe as the Republican Party’s extreme position on abortion. This dynamic is playing out in gubernatorial contests in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona — all of which have GOP-controlled state legislatures.

“The landscape changes from state to state, but our message has stayed focused on making sure voters know what a Republican can do to either chip away at current rights or advance existing restrictions,” said Christina Amestoy, a spokesperson for the Democratic Governors Association.

The notion of abortion access changing by the party in power is driving increased attention to statewide races up and down the ballot, even as control of Congress hangs in the balance of this year’s midterm elections. Meanwhile, GOP officials believe the party has a chance to make inroads with late-deciding voters, particularly as the months pass since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, our colleague Annie Linskey reported yesterday.

What the Michigan midterms mean for the future of abortion

Gretchen Whitmer (D) and activists explain <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Proposal 3,</span> a midterm ballot measure which would enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution. (Video: Hannah Jewell, Lindsey Sitz, Ross Godwin/The Washington Post, Photo: Emily Elconin/The Washington Post)

The landscape: The midterms are less than five weeks away. Voters <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 36 states</span> will choose their governor — <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 20 Republicans</span> <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 16 Democrats</span> holding offices that will be up for election this year.

Groups on both sides of the abortion debate — such as NARAL Pro-Choice America and SBA Pro-Life America — are pouring their resources into governor’s races.

Here are the key contests we’re watching:

Wisconsin: Gov. Tony Evers (D) is in a competitive race against Republican nominee Tim Michels. The state has a pre-Roe ban on the books, which Evers filed a lawsuit to repeal and the state’s Democratic attorney general has said he won’t enforce. However, clinics halted all abortion procedures shortly after the Supreme Court’s ruling.

Michigan: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) is running against Republican challenger Tudor Dixon. Abortion in the state is legal after a state judge invalidated a pre-Roe ban on the procedure. Whitmer has asked the state Supreme Court to strike down the ban as well.

But even if Dixon wins, a Republican-controlled legislature could have a hard time enacting bans on the procedure. That’s because voters will decide whether to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution this November.

Arizona: Katie Hobbs (D) and Kari Lake (R) are fighting to fill this open seat. Earlier this year, Gov. Doug Ducey (R) — who is term-limited — signed legislation banning abortion <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 15 weeks</span>. However, an Arizona judge revived a near-total ban on abortion dating back to the mid-19th century a day before the 15-week limit was set to go into effect.

Pennsylvania: This is another contest with no incumbent. State Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D) and state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R) are fighting to succeed the state’s Democratic governor. Abortions are still legal in the state, but that could change if Mastriano wins and the GOP-controlled legislature sends restrictions on the procedure to his desk.

Georgia: This gubernatorial battle is a redo <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2018.</span> Gov. Brian Kemp (R) is again facing Democrat Stacey Abrams, who has made abortion rights a centerpiece of her campaign. The state has a ban on abortion after fetal cardiac activity, which is at roughly six weeks.

Democrats are working to keep the midterms focused on abortion, believing the issue is a powerful motivator to drive voters to the ballot box. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">However, those efforts are colliding with increased Republican efforts to focus on crime and the economy.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Nationally, recent Google News searches for inflation have been about even with inquiries on abortion.</span> This is the case for battleground states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Georgia, Annie reports.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">* “The moderate and independent voters needed to build winning coalitions in competitive governors races are worried about the economy, crime, and education,” Joanna Rodriguez, a Republican Governors Association spokesperson, said in a statement to The <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Health 202.</span></span></span> The focus on abortion shows to those voters that Democrats “not only don't care about their greatest concerns, but also that they have no plans to address them,” Rodriguez said.,

Here's one interesting figure: Democrats in local, statewide and congressional races across the country have vastly outspent Republicans on advertising on abortion. Since Jan.<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> Democrats have spent <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $236 million</span>. Meanwhile, Republicans have spent <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $62 million</span>, according to AdImpact, which tracks commercials. (h/t Azi Paybarah, who crunched the numbers for us.)

Meanwhile,<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 66 clinics</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">across 15 states</span> have stopped offering abortions, according to a report out today from the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research center that supports abortion rights. <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Roughly 40 are</span> offering services other than abortion, <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">while 26 have</span> shut down. Before the Supreme Court's ruling, those states had a total <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 79 clinics</span> providing abortions. <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 13 that</span> are still performing the procedure are located in Georgia, where there's a ban after fetal cardiac activity is detected.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Biden administration’s Project Covid Shield hits a snag

The Biden administration’s plan to create a new accelerator for coronavirus vaccines and treatments has hit a standstill, complicated by fading interest among the public and lawmakers alike to continue treating the pandemic as a priority, Politico reports.

</span>Now, senior health officials are raising alarm bells about the nation’s defenses against the rapidly evolving virus without a long-term operation to ensure that its arsenal of tools stay up-to-date with the latest variants.

Key context: The initiative, dubbed Project Covid Shield, was intended to serve as a follow up to Operation Warp Speed, a Trump-era program that doled out federal dollars to private drugmakers to speed up the production of coronavirus vaccines. Officials had hoped to replicate the approach with new candidates to continue developing increasingly advanced shots and therapeutics to fight the virus — all while maintaining the nation’s edge in the global war against covid-19, Politico’s Adam Cancryn and Erin Banco write.

The White House has yet to secure <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $8 billion</span> from Congress it says it needs to get Project Covid Shield off the ground due to a stalemate with Republicans over new coronavirus aid. Meanwhile, even GOP lawmakers open to the concept have categorized the administration’s effort to date as disorganized and vague.

Americans give failing marks to U.S. health-care system

New this a.m.: Nearly half of adults give the country’s health care system a poor or failing grade, according to a new West Health-Gallup poll, which found that Americans across party lines see lobbying and partisan politics as major barriers to finding solutions to address the rising costs of medicine.

By the numbers:

* Sixty-six percent of Americans report their household pays too much relative to the quality of care that it receives, up six points compared with April of last year, according to the poll, which surveyed more <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 5,5000 adults</span>., * <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Six <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 10 Americans</span> report that cost is an important factor when considering a recommended medical procedure or medication., *</span> Half the country — an <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 129 million</span> adults — have low levels of confidence that they can afford health care as they age., * Two in three Americans <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 65 believe</span> Medicare will not exist when they reach the age of eligibility.,

First in The Health 202: Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), a pharmacist, is rolling out a campaign attacking pharmacy benefit managers often known as drug middlemen. In a new 20-page pamphlet, Carter alleges that PBMs use “various tactics to limit patient medication and increase drug costs” and includes interviews with patients.

It’s another salvo in the drug-pricing wars, where PBMs and other industry players spar over who’s driving up the costs. Carter points to various pieces of legislation he wants to see passed, such as a bill he introduced that would ban the use of spread pricing in Medicaid managed care. Spread pricing is when PBMs charge payers more than they pay to the pharmacy and keep the difference.

PBMs hit back. “Americans consistently reject the use of blame game tactics, especially when real patients’ health and lives are at stake,” JC Scott, the president of Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, said in a statement to The <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Health 202.</span></span> “This is especially true when it comes to blaming PBMs, the one entity reducing costs in the health care system,” Scott said.

* The anonymous woman who accused Herschel Walker of urging her to have an abortion and paying for the procedure revealed that she is the mother of one of his children, after Walker claimed he had no clue about her identity, the Daily Beast reports., * A 14-year-old Arizona patient was initially denied her rheumatoid arthritis medication after the state’s abortion ban took effect last month because the drug can also be used to terminate pregnancies, our colleague María Luisa Paúl writes., * Public health officials are warning Florida’s contaminated waterways following Hurricane Ian could pose a short-term risk to people’s health if they’re exposed, The Post’s Kasha Patel reports., * The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is seeking public input as it develops a National Directory of Healthcare Providers and Services, which is meant to serve as a centralized hub for medical workers’ and facilities’ directory information.,

The outcome is a bonanza for Disney: <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Even as the company limits the number of visitors and keeps attendance at its U.S. theme parks below prepandemic levels, they are generating record sales and profits.

</span>The results reflect a major strategic shift on Disney’s part, where the company is focused less on maximizing the quantity of visitors and more on increasing how much money each visitor spends, an approach the company refers to as yield management. Improving the visitor experience, the thinking goes, will prompt guests to spend more hours—and therefore more money—at the parks because they are having such a good time.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The biggest change in the past two years—and the most lucrative for Disney—is the introduction of a smartphone-app feature called Genie+ that <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">costs $15 per</span> person a day, on top of the price of admission, and allows parkgoers to skip the unreserved lines for some attractions, which the company refers to as “standby.”</span> But Genie+ doesn’t cover everything. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">To skip the standby lines at the most sought-after attractions, including some Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy-themed rides, reservations now cost an <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $10 to</span><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $17.</span></span> Standby waits for popular attractions can last hours.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">At the same time, many benefits that used to be free—from parking for certain annual passholders to airport shuttles to MagicBand wristbands that serve as combination hotel-room keys and park passes—have been eliminated or now come with a price.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Disney has raised prices on hotel rooms, food and merchandise over the past year as inflation has climbed to record levels in the U.S.

Disney’s theme-park pricing is determined by “pure supply and demand,” said a company spokeswoman.</span> “No different than airplanes, hotels or cruise ships.”

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">In the quarter that ended Jan.<span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> Disney’s domestic parks set records in both quarterly revenue and operating income, then broke both of them six months later.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">For the quarter that ended <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2,</span> the business unit that includes the theme parks also posted record revenue <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $5.42 billion</span> and record operating income <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.65 billion</span>.

Josh D’Amaro, the chairman of Disney’s parks, experiences and products division, said that the changes have given visitors more choice about how to spend their time and money at the parks, while at the same time making the parks “extremely commercially successful.”

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">In <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fiscal 2021,</span> the first year that both of Disney’s two main U.S. resorts had reopened following the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, attendance at Disney’s U.S. parks fell <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 17% compared</span> with the previous year, the company reported, but per-capita spending by guests grew <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 17%,</span> or nearly three times the average annual growth rate during the previous decade.</span> Disney doesn’t disclose attendance for its theme parks.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">At the same time, the changes driving the increases in revenue and profit have drawn the ire of what Disney calls “legacy fans,” or longtime parks loyalists, including annual passholders who feel they are being pushed to the side in favor of big-spending families taking once-a-year, or even a once-in-a-lifetime, vacations.

</span>“Disney has this love-hate relationship with annual passholders,” said Len Testa, a computer scientist who runs Touring Plans, a travel company that offers apps to help visitors find deals and navigate their trips to Walt Disney World and publishes a popular guide to Disney theme parks.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">On one hand, they provide a reliable source of revenue—the investment bank UBS estimated early last year that annual passholders at Disneyland account for about one half of annual visits—but on the other, annual passholders tend to spend less than other visitors per visit, Mr. Testa said.

</span>A typical annual pass holder might ride only one ride during a visit, eat an ice cream cone and walk around for a few hours, taking up capacity that might otherwise be used by out-of-state visitors, Mr. Testa said.

“Those people would have stayed all day,” he said. “They would have eaten multiple times in the restaurants, they may have stayed in the hotel. They would definitely be buying more merchandise.”

Since its introduction in the fall <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2021,</span> Genie+ has become an increasingly popular tool. About half of visitors to the parks pay for and use Genie+, Disney said in a recent conference call with Wall Street analysts. And of those who pay for Genie+,<span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 70% say</span> in post-visit surveys that they plan to do so again, Disney says.

Disney has stopped selling nearly all new annual passes to Disneyland and Walt Disney World and has done away with a host of free perks that annual passholders used to enjoy. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Existing annual passholders can renew their passes, although earlier this month, the company raised the renewal price for its highest-tier annual passes to Disneyland <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 14%,</span> <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1,599 from</span><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $1,399,</span> while at the same time introducing more blackout days when passholders can’t visit, angering some of the park’s most ardent fans.

</span>The parks have grown considerably since Walt Disney World opened <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1971.</span> Over the past decade, Disney has added rides based on popular franchises such as Star Wars, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Toy Story films and <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2009 film</span> “Avatar.” A roller coaster at Magic Kingdom based on the Tron films is under construction.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The parks business has buoyed Disney’s stock price and boosted financial results at a time when the company is losing billions on other businesses, like the popular but cost-heavy Disney+ streaming service.

</span>Mr. D’Amaro, the parks chief, is a 24-year veteran of the company who ran both Disneyland and Walt Disney World individually in previous roles.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">He keeps a high profile with fans and employees, making frequent appearances at the parks outside of major events and posting about his visits on social media.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">By contrast, his predecessor, Bob Chapek, who is now Disney’s chief executive, walked the park grounds less frequently and wasn’t as outgoing with visitors, according to Disney employees who worked under him.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">On a recent, hourlong walk through Disneyland, Mr. D’Amaro was stopped more <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20 times</span> by visitors and cast members—as Disney employees are known in company lingo—who asked to take selfies with him and thanked him for his work.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Mr. D’Amaro <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has 144,000 followers</span> on Instagram, where he posts pictures of himself inside the parks alongside costumed employees, riding roller coasters, brandishing lightsabers and eating soft-serve.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Mr. D’Amaro said he’s aware of the tension caused by rising prices and other changes, especially for annual passholders, but describes it as the inevitable result of progress, and insists that every change Disney has implemented at the parks is in service of improving visitors’ trips.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Other top Disney executives say the company is merely reacting to consumer behavior.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">“Demand has not abated” at the parks, Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy told analysts in a conference call in August, explaining why the company wasn’t considering opening up the parks to more days for annual passholders.</span> The new reservation system has allowed the company to limit attendance without having to turn visitors away when the parks become overcrowded, as it occasionally did in previous years.

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">The company also points out that it offers frequent promotions, including discounted room rates at its hotels, packages that become more economical the more days a visitor spends at the park, and discounts for residents of Southern California and Florida.

</span>Other theme-park operators are also reaping the benefits of increased guest spending. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Six Flags Entertainment Corp. and Cedar Fair LP, which operates Cedar Point in Ohio and Knott’s Berry Farm in California, have both raised prices, while SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. implemented <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 5% surcharge</span> on food and beverages.

</span>Sara Suvada, a Starbucks shift supervisor and barista from Auburn Hills, Mich., took her first trip to Walt Disney World in January, at the age <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 42,</span> along with her husband and 6-year-old daughter. She said the trip was the fulfillment of a fantasy from her childhood, when money was tight in her family.

The family spent <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $5,000</span>—most of it paid for by Ms. Suvada’s in-laws—on admission, meals and lodging at Disney’s Saratoga Springs Resort. Ms. Suvada spent <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $400 on</span> souvenirs and concessions, while her husband told her he nearly maxed out his credit card on trinkets and snacks.

<span id=""25"" class=""red"">The memories made up for the price tag, though, she said.</span> She cried when she saw Cinderella Castle for the first time. Her daughter loved riding the Space Mountain roller coaster and meeting her favorite princess, Tiana, from 2009’s “The Princess and the Frog.” And the family savored tasting their first Dole Whip frozen treat. Ms. Suvada is already thinking about returning with her mother.

“The memories are worth more than gold,” she said. “Even if I did suffer from overdraft fees once I got home, when the reality set in.”

Some longtime fans who come to the park regularly, and aren’t splurging on once-in-a-lifetime memories, complain about the new fees.

“I just really resent the nickel-and-diming,” said David Arone, a 50-year-old gym teacher and volleyball coach from Redondo Beach, Calif. Mr. Arone has been a Disneyland annual pass holder for five years, and says he visits the park more <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 times</span> a year, primarily because it reminds him of his best childhood friend, a Disney superfan who died of a heart attack <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013.</span></span>

“I know it sounds hokey, but every time I go, I feel like he’s there with me,” Mr. Arone said of his friend. Most visits, he doesn’t ride any attractions at all. Instead, he just walks around for a few hours, eats ice cream, watches fireworks and reminisces about visiting the park with his late friend.

But he chafes at recent changes. Previously, he could stop by Disneyland for a few hours after work any day he wanted. Now he can’t go on the growing number of blackout days for annual passholders.

<span id=""26"" class=""red"">On a recent visit, Mr. Arone sported a homemade T-shirt with the words “Chapek Killed The Magic” on it — a reference to Mr. Chapek, the CEO, who he blames for rising prices and other changes.

</span>The company said annual passholders like Mr. Arone “are amongst our most special guests.”

<span id=""27"" class=""red"">This month, the company reported that ticket-price increases were offset by an “unfavorable attendance mix” at Disneyland, which many fans interpreted as a reference to annual passholders who typically spend less per visit than individual ticket-buyers.</span> Fans recently started posting pictures of themselves at the parks on social media, wearing T-shirts reading “Unfavorable” in protest.

<span id=""28"" class=""red"">Disney said that “unfavorable mix” is financial parlance meant for investors, and “not a consumer term.”

</span><span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2021,</span> a Disneyland annual pass holder sued Disney, alleging that the company engaged in deceptive practices by artificially limiting how many of them could visit the park on certain days. In May, a U.S. District Court judge in California ruled that the suit could go forward. The plaintiff has said she is seeking class-action certification.

<span id=""29"" class=""red"">Even some customers who come on special annual visits say they are getting fed up with rising prices.

</span>Renea Warren has made the pilgrimage to Walt Disney World nearly every year <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2001.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">But after tallying up the costs of this year’s vacation, the retail executive and mother of one said she has had enough.

</span>On a nine-day family trip to Florida in late July with her mother and daughter, Ms. Warren tried to save money by spending just two days at Disney theme parks, instead of the usual four. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Despite the family’s efforts, visits to Magic Kingdom and Epcot blew up their budget.</span> Park passes set them back more than $800; food was about $200; and they <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped $300 on</span> souvenirs.

Since Ms. Warren, who lives in Benton Harbor, Mich., owns a timeshare <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 minutes</span>’ drive from Walt Disney World, her family will likely return to central Florida next year, but they’ll consider rival attractions at Universal Studios Florida and SeaWorld, she said. Returning to Disney every year is no longer an option.

“Because of the astronomical expenses, I definitely think the magic is being taken away,” she said.

The Genie+ app feature replaced a system known as FastPass that used to come free with any ticket sold at Disneyland or Walt Disney World. The new service—along with a free version, known simply as Genie—does more than make Disney money: It also helps the parks’ operators direct traffic and spread people around the parks more evenly, to reduce waiting times overall, and upsell visitors by offering them promotions on food, merchandise and ride-reservation fees.

Each park has an operation center with a “heat map” that tracks where Genie+ users are in the parks using GPS technology. Park operators can direct traffic using the app by notifying visitors where the shortest lines are and offering food and merchandise promotions to cajole them to other areas.

“If I’m seeing too much activity on the west side, I’m able to spread where I direct people to the east side,” Mr. D’Amaro said. “Our attractions will be load-balanced better, and lines will be shorter, and what that means is the experience will be better.”

<span id=""32"" class=""red"">In an analysis for The Wall Street Journal, Touring Plans analyzed room prices, including taxes, at three popular Walt Disney World hotels over the past decade, and found increases that far outpaced inflation, which in July hit a record high <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 9.1%.</span>

</span>At Pop Century, a “value” hotel at the Orlando resort, the cheapest room rate rose <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $168 this</span> year from $95 <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013.</span></span> At the deluxe Animal Kingdom Lodge, a standard room now costs as much <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $790 a</span> night, versus up <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $486 a</span> decade ago.

<span id=""33"" class=""red"">Prices for tickets and certain food items have also climbed faster than inflation over the past decade, the Touring Plans analysis found.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">Disney fan blogs have noted that classic purchases at Disney parks, including the pineapple Dole Whip frozen treat ($5.99 last year,<span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $6.99 this</span> year at some locations) and studded Mickey Mouse-ears headbands ($29.99 last summer, <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">now $39.99</span>) are quickly getting costlier, outpacing inflation.

</span>In other cases, Disney has curtailed benefits. Guests staying at Disney-owned and certain other hotels at Walt Disney World before Covid could avail themselves of Extra Magic Hours, during which hotel guests could enter certain theme parks early or stay at them later into the night.

Today, Disney offers early entry at all four of its Walt Disney World parks each day to hotel guests, but only <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 30 minutes</span>; before the pandemic, it offered an hour of early admission, but only every other day. Evening extended hours are now only available to visitors staying at the most-expensive “deluxe” tier of hotels.

Disney says some guests prefer the new arrangement.

Mariana Epperson, a 29-year-old mom from Kentucky who works as an account manager for a credit-ratings firm, spent part of her honeymoon at Disneyland, and Walt Disney World is the site of some of her final happy memories with her father, who died a few weeks after she took a trip there with her family in May.

“A lot of people will say, ‘Oh, I can go to Europe for cheaper,’ ” she said. “But Disney now holds the last really good memories of my dad, so for me it’s so important. I can always make more money.”

Even so, this summer, her husband told her he needed a break from the theme parks. They’ve visited Disney resorts six times <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2017,</span> and the parks are getting way too expensive, she said. For their family vacation next year, they are thinking about a Disney cruise. Packages for three-night cruises from San Diego or Miami start at just <span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $1,000.</span> An ocean-view cabin costs more. So do between-meal snacks and excursions ashore.

Which options are worth paying for?

Updated Feb.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 22,</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 12</span>:01 am ET

Amir and Mojgan Moghadam <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $1.4 million</span> on their new home in Irvine, Calif. But to make it absolutely perfect, they spent a <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">further $550,000 on</span> builder upgrades—<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including $28,200 for</span> a conservatory,<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $2,600 for</span> a Sub-Zero ice maker <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $495 for</span> five exterior wall-light outlets.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Buying a newly built home is a lot like buying a new car at the dealership—optional features cost extra.</span> Buyers will pay more for premium granite, a fancier fridge or an epoxy-coated garage floor. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">And upgrades can be a lucrative part of a builder's business, with profit margins as high <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 60%,</span> depending on the option, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting.

</span>Indeed, buyers like the Moghadams are helping builders return to profitability after a long downturn. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">During the housing boom, homes were loaded with expensive features, and buyers snapped them up, regardless of price.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">These days, however, upscale buyers are choosier, selecting pricey options that are within their budgets and still practical for the resale market.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">An <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 10% to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30% of</span> a home's base price is spent on upgrades.</span> And companies say these optional features have been spurring growth in high-end home construction.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Record-low interest rates are driving much of this spending, with a 30-year, fixed-rate average <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3.68% for</span> conforming loans, which are <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $417,000 in</span> most markets, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 4.13% for</span> larger loans, according to HSH.com, a mortgage-research website.</span> Monica Kaiser, for instance, added <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $70,000 worth</span> of upgrades to <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $1 million</span>-plus San Diego home she and her husband purchased in December. The Kaisers decided to spend the money now—instead of later—for the upgrades they wanted. The Kaisers opted for <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $10,000 staircase</span> with wrought-iron balusters and <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $4,500 for</span> tile and stonework in the home's 41⁄2 bathrooms, along with other features from builder Standard Pacific.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">""With interest rates so low, you're not going to be able to get what you want any cheaper at any time,"" says Ms. Kaiser, a mother of three who works for local media outlet.</span> ""To put a lot of these upgrades in down the line would have just been silly, because we'd be paying more to take out a loan or dipping into other assets.""

Some builders present buyers with thousands of choices that let them build a near-custom home that won't resemble anything else in their community. Customizing a home can make a customer less likely to cancel the deal. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">""They're emotionally attached to what they have designed,"" says Joan Marcus-Colvin, senior vice president of sales, marketing and design for the New Home Co.</span> ""They have actually pictured themselves living in that surrounding.""

To this end, builders construct lavish model homes to showcase the full range of options. Toll Brothers, a luxury builder based in Horsham, Pa., is known for models that ""pretty much upgrade everything,"" says Denise DiBlasio, who manages Toll's design studio in Bucks County, Pa. Toll will put a fireplace in the master bath or a wine grotto in the basement.

In North Palm Beach, Fla., Toll poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into upgrades for the model home at its upscale Frenchman's Harbor community, where single-family homes start <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $1.7 million</span>. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The company says it is not unusual for a buyer to replicate the model or to copy the kitchen, regardless of cost.

</span>Toll, like many other builders, has bricks-and-mortar design centers stocked with samples of everything from carpet colors to granite slabs that customers can touch and coordinate with other items. Interior-design specialists are on hand to guide buyers on what's hot and help them avoid design disasters.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">The New Home Co., a three-year-old upscale builder in California with starting prices as high <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $2 million</span>, took <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in $9 million</span> from its design studios <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> up <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $7.6 million</span> the prior year.

</span>Publicly traded builders, who sell more homes but generally don't disclose profits from upgrades, can rake in much more. Jeffrey Burnett estimates he and his wife spent three full days at Toll's Boca Raton, Fla., design center, one <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 15 nationwide</span>, selecting extras for <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his $2.5 million</span> home under construction in Frenchman's Harbor. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">In the end, Mr. Burnett, chief executive officer of Labor Finders International, a nationwide blue-collar staffing company based in Palm Beach Gardens, <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">added $800,000 worth</span> of upgrades, including <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $100,000 tennis</span> court and a steam room.

</span>In the past decade, builders have increasingly been allowing buyers to pick favorite items through a website or app. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Buyers can almost think of it like a game: They choose options to build their dream homes, then add or delete items as the budget permits.

</span>""It was like I was going to the store,"" says Ms. Moghadam, the Irvine, Calif., buyer of the New Home Co. house. ""I would sit on my iPad and I would just pick out all the options I liked: cabinets, sinks, hardware, faucets. You could just do it at home and have fun with it.""

The most money is usually spent on kitchens, bathrooms and flooring, according to BDX, the marketing-services and technology company behind the Envision online design center that helps customers select options. Buyers upgrade <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">flooring 73% of</span> the time, <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cabinets 70% and</span> <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">appliances 63%,</span> the company says.

In the kitchen, large, granite-topped islands that seat four to eight people are popular, as are supersize showers with sitting space, says Jeffrey Lake, Standard Pacific's national head of architecture.

Northeasterners like crown molding and wainscoting, while Florida buyers often spring for a screened-in lanai and a bathroom specifically for the pool area. On the West Coast, consumers are more likely to add large glass doors that can be opened to seamlessly combine the family living space with the outdoors, he said.

Builders warn buyers to keep an eye on spending to avoid appraisal woes. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">An extensively upgraded home could appear overvalued when compared with recent nearby sales.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">If that happens, the builder may have to cut the price or ask the buyer for extra money at the closing.</span> For that reason—and to help pay for the purchase and installation of the upgrade—some builders require upgrade deposits in advance. The Moghadams, whose purchase contract for extras <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">covered 32 pages</span>, paid <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 50% of</span> their upgrades upfront, though that was spread across multiple payments.

<span id=""14"" class=""red"">M.D.C.

Negotiating as the clock ran down, Israeli parties ranging from the left to the far right, including an Arab bloc, agreed on a coalition government.
This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the Israeli election and its aftermath here.
JERUSALEM — Israeli opposition parties on Wednesday reached a coalition agreement to form a government and oust Benjamin Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history and a dominant figure who has pushed his nation’s politics to the right.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The announcement by the parties could lead to the easing of a political impasse that has produced four elections in two years and left Israel without a stable government or a state budget.</span> If Parliament ratifies the fragile agreement in a confidence vote in the coming days, it will also bring down the curtain, if only for an intermission, on the premiership of a leader who has defined contemporary Israel more than any other.
The new coalition is an unusual and awkward alliance between eight political parties from a diverse array of ideologies, from the left to the far right. It includes the membership of a small Arab party called Raam, which would become the first Arab group to join a right-leaning coalition in Israeli history.
While some analysts have hailed the coalition as reflecting the breadth and complexity of contemporary society, others say its members are too incompatible for their compact to last, and consider it the embodiment of Israel’s political dysfunction.
The alliance would be led <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2023 by</span> Naftali Bennett, a religiously observant former settler leader who opposes a Palestinian state and wants Israel to annex the majority of the occupied West Bank. He is a former ally of Mr. Netanyahu often described as more right-wing than the prime minister.
If the government lasts a whole term, it would then be led <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2023 and</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2025 by</span> Yair Lapid, a centrist former television host considered a standard-bearer for secular Israelis.
The son of American immigrants, Mr. Bennett,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 49,</span></span> is a former software entrepreneur, army commando, chief of staff to Mr. Netanyahu and defense minister. His home is in central Israel, but he was once chief executive of an umbrella group, the Yesha Council, that represents Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. Until the most recent election cycle, Mr. Bennett was part of a political alliance with Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right leader.
Though Mr. Bennett’s party, Yamina, won just seven of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 120 seats</span></span> in Parliament, the anti-Netanyahu forces could not form a government without his support, allowing him to set the terms of his involvement in the coalition.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Mr. Lapid,<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 57,</span> is a former news anchor and journalist who became a politician nine years ago and later served as finance minister in a Netanyahu-led coalition.</span> His party placed second in the general election in March, <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">winning 17 seats</span>. But Mr. Lapid considered the ouster of Mr. Netanyahu more important than demanding to go first as prime minister.
Yair Lapid, the leader of the Israeli opposition, had until midnight on Wednesday to cobble together an unlikely coalition to topple Benjamin Netanyahu. He needed almost every minute — leaving it until 11:22 p.m. to inform Reuven Rivlin, Israel’s largely ceremonial president, that he had assembled an eight-party alliance.
“The government will do everything it can to unite every part of Israeli society,” Mr. Lapid said in a statement released shortly after his call with Mr. Rivlin.
Mr. Lapid’s celebrations will be put on hold for several days, however. The speaker of the Israeli Parliament, Yariv Levin, is a member of Mr. Netanyahu’s party, Likud, and can use parliamentary procedure to delay the confidence vote until Monday, <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 14,</span> constitutional experts said.
In the meantime, Mr. Netanyahu’s party has promised to pile pressure on wavering members of Mr. Lapid’s fragile coalition, formed of hard-right parties, leftists, centrists and Arab Islamists, in a bid to persuade them to abandon the coalition. Many of them already feel uncomfortable about working with each other, and have made difficult compromises to join forces in order to push Mr. Netanyahu from office.
Mr. Lapid himself agreed to give Naftali Bennett, a hard-right former settler leader who opposes Palestinian statehood, the chance to lead the government <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2023,</span> at which point Mr. Lapid will take over.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">In a sign of the friction to come, Raam, the Arab Islamist party, announced that it had joined the coalition after receiving assurances about improvements to the Arab minority’s land and housing rights that many hard-right Israelis deem unacceptable, including the regularization of three illegally constructed Arab towns in the Negev desert.
</span>An hour before the deal was announced, one hard-right lawmaker, Nir Orbach, whose party colleagues say he has been particularly unsure about joining the coalition, tweeted: “We are not abandoning the Negev. Period.”
The fact that these tensions were on full display even before the coalition was officially formed has left many Israelis wondering whether it will last more than a few months, let alone its full term.
Should the coalition collapse, analysts believe Mr. Lapid may emerge with more credit than Mr. Bennett. While Mr. Bennett gets first crack at the premiership, his decision to work with centrists and leftists has angered his already small following.
“Lapid has made a very strong set of decisions, conveyed an amazing level of maturity and really made a big statement about a different kind of leadership,” said Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli political analyst and pollster at the Century Foundation, a New York-based research group. “That will not be lost on the Israeli public.”

Now that opposition parties have reached agreement on a coalition government, it has up to seven days to present the government to Parliament for a vote of confidence.
Some disagreements within the fractious coalition were still being ironed out until shortly before the deadline on Wednesday, at midnight in Israel.
And with the fate of the new coalition dependent on a narrow margin and hanging on every single vote, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies were on the hunt for potential defectors leading up to the announcement, and signaled that they would continue until the vote of confidence.
The coalition, ranging from right to left, is united primarily by its opposition to Mr. Netanyahu, the prime minister <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2009.</span>
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Israel has held four parliamentary elections in two years, all of them inconclusive, leaving it without a stable government or state budget.</span> If the opposition fails to form a government, it could lead to yet another election.
Naftali Bennett, who is poised to become Israel’s next prime minister, is a former high-tech entrepreneur best known for insisting that there must never be a full-fledged Palestinian state and that Israel should annex much of the occupied West Bank.
The independently wealthy son of immigrants from the United States, Mr. Bennett,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 49,</span></span> first entered the Israeli Parliament eight years ago and is relatively unknown and inexperienced on the international stage. That has left much of the world — and many Israelis — wondering what kind of leader he might be.
A former chief of staff to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, Mr. Bennett is often described as more right-wing than his old boss. Shifting between seemingly contradictory alliances, Mr. Bennett has been called an extremist and an opportunist. Allies say he is merely a pragmatist, less ideological than he appears, and lacking Mr. Netanyahu’s penchant for demonizing opponents.
In a measure of Mr. Bennett’s talents, he has now pulled off a feat that is extraordinary even by the perplexing standards of Israeli politics. He has all but maneuvered himself into the top office even though his party, Yamina, won just seven of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 120 seats</span></span> in the Parliament.
Mr. Bennett leveraged his modest but pivotal electoral weight after the inconclusive March election, Israel’s fourth in two years. He entered coalition talks as a kingmaker, and appears ready to emerge as the one wearing the crown.
Mr. Bennett has long championed West Bank settlers and once led the council representing them, though he is not a settler, himself. He is religiously observant — he would be the first prime minister to wear a kipa — but he will head a governing coalition that is largely secular.
He would lead a precarious coalition that spans Israel’s fractious political spectrum from left to right, and includes a small Arab, Islamist party — much of which opposes his ideas on settlement and annexation. That coalition proposes to paper over its differences on Israeli-Palestinian relations by focusing on domestic matters.
Mr. Bennett has explained his motives for teaming up with such ideological opposites as an act of last resort to end the political impasse that has paralyzed Israel.
“The political crisis in Israel is unprecedented on a global level,” he said in a televised speech on Sunday. “We could end up with fifth, sixth, even 10th elections, dismantling the walls of the country, brick by brick, until our house falls in on us. Or we can stop the madness and take responsibility.”
One of the most unlikely kingmakers involved in the formation of a new government is Mansour Abbas, the leader of the small Arab party known by its Hebrew acronym, Raam, with four seats in the current Parliament.
Under an 11th-hour deal, Raam formally agreed to join a Lapid-Bennett coalition government, though it would not hold any Cabinet seats. That was something of a surprise, as the party was expected to remain outside the coalition, while supporting it in a confidence vote in the Parliament. Some Arab lawmakers played a similar role by supporting Yitzhak Rabin’s government from the outside in the 1990s.
For decades, Arab parties have not been directly involved in Israeli governments. They have been mostly shunned by other parties, and are leery of joining a government that oversees occupation of the Palestinian territories and Israel’s military actions.
But after decades of political marginalization, many Palestinian citizens, who make up a fifth of Israel’s population, have been seeking fuller integration.
Israel’s early, leftist governments included Arab parties that were closely affiliated with the mostly Jewish parties. Raam would be the first independent Arab party in government, and the first Arab party of any kind in a right-leaning government.
Raam has been willing to work with both the pro- and anti-Netanyahu camps since the March election and to use its leverage to wrest concessions for the Arab public. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The party has refused to commit to a deal unless it gets assurances for greater resources and rights for Israel’s Arab minority, including reforms to housing legislation that potential hard-right coalition partners do not accept.

Sitting in her office in Parliament on Wednesday afternoon, Idit Silman, a hard-right lawmaker, flicked through hundreds of recent text messages from unknown numbers.
Some were laced with abusive language. Some warned she was going to hell. All of them demanded that her party abandon coalition negotiations with an alliance of centrist, leftist and right-wing lawmakers seeking to replace Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 12 years</span>.
“It’s very hard,” Ms. Silman said. “People would rather put pressure on Idit Silman than see Benjamin Netanyahu leave Balfour Street,” she added, in a reference to the location of the prime minister’s official residence.
As opposition negotiators race to meet a midnight deadline to agree on a new government, supporters of Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud party were working overtime to pressure Ms. Silman and other members of the right-wing Yamina party.
Many right-wing Israelis see Yamina’s turn against Mr. Netanyahu as a betrayal.
This onslaught gave Ms. Silman and her colleagues pause for thought — and an incentive to be seen as prolonging the negotiations for as long as possible. Though Yamina did finally join the coalition on Wednesday night, Mr. Netanyahu’s party, Likud, is likely to continue to play on these fears.
Parliament might not hold a vote of confidence in a new government for <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another 10 days</span>, giving Mr. Netanyahu more time to persuade Yamina lawmakers to reverse course.
His party has already promised to keep goading Ms. Silman and her colleagues.
“Behind the scenes,” said a senior Likud official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, “the Likud party is ramping up the pressure, particularly on the weakest links.”
The pressure has been relentless for days, since the phone numbers of Ms. Silman and her colleagues, they say, were posted on several WhatsApp and Facebook groups. That has prompted a barrage of messages — and not just from Israelis. Evangelical pastors in the United States have weighed in, and so have Hasidic activists in Britain, among many others.
The Likud party denies accusations that it posted any numbers publicly.
When Ms. Silman turned up at her local synagogue last week, she found several slick posters outside, each with her portrait overlaid with the slogan: “Idit Silman stitched together a government with terror supporters.”
For days, protesters have picketed her home, shouted abuse at her children, and trailed her by car in a menacing fashion, she said.
Yamina’s leader, Naftali Bennett, decided to negotiate with the opposition on Sunday night, after months of wavering. His calculus was based on realism, analysts say: Mr. Netanyahu cannot form a coalition, even with Mr. Bennett’s support. So Mr. Bennett can either fall in with the opposition, who have offered him the chance to be prime minister — or force the country to a fifth election in little more than two years.
“We always ask ourselves this question,” Ms. Silman said on Wednesday afternoon. “Is it right? Can we do something else?”
Patrick Kingsley and
Naftali Bennett, who leads a small right-wing party, and Yair Lapid, the centrist leader of the Israeli opposition, have joined forces to try to form a diverse coalition to unseat Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister.
Spanning Israel’s fractious political spectrum from left to right, and relying on the support of a small Arab, Islamist party, the proposed coalition, dubbed the “change government” by supporters, could signal a profound shift for Israel. Its leaders have pledged to end the cycle of divisive politics and inconclusive elections.
The opposition parties announced a coalition agreement on Wednesday. But even if they survive a vote of confidence in the Parliament and form a government, toppling Mr. Netanyahu, how much change would their “change government” bring, when some of the parties agree on little else besides antipathy for Israel’s longest-serving leader?
Mr. Bennett, whose party won seven seats in Parliament, is often described as further to the right than Mr. Netanyahu. While Mr. Netanyahu eroded the idea of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr. Bennett, a religiously observant champion of Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, openly rejects the concept of a sovereign Palestinian state and has advocated annexing West Bank territory.
Still, though the coalition will include several parties that disagree on both those issues, they have agreed to allow Mr. Bennett to become prime minister first.
If the coalition deal holds, Mr. Bennett would be replaced for the second part of the four-year term by Mr. Lapid, who advocates for secular, middle-class Israelis and whose party <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">won 17 seats</span>.
By conceding the first turn in the rotation, Mr. Lapid, who has been branded as a dangerous leftist by his opponents on the right, smoothed the way for other right-wing politicians to join the new anti-Netanyahu alliance.
In a measure of the plot twists and tumult behind this political turnaround, Mr. Bennett had pledged before the election not to enable a Lapid government of any kind or any government reliant on the Islamist party, called Raam.
The coalition would stand or fall on the cooperation between eight parties with disparate ideologies and, on many issues, clashing agendas.
In a televised address on Sunday night, Mr. Bennett said he was committed to fostering national unity.
“Two thousand years ago, there was a Jewish state which fell here because of internal quarrels,” he said. “This will not happen again. Not on my watch.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Even as the country and its Parliament remained deeply divided over the formation of a new government, Israeli lawmakers came together on Wednesday to elect a new president, Isaac Herzog, a former leader of the Labor party and government minister.
</span>Displaying a rare degree of consensus in a secret ballot, they voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Herzog, who currently serves as the chairman of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency for Israel, which helps deal with immigration, interacts with the Jewish diaspora and runs social programs.
The president plays a mostly symbolic role as a national unifier in Israel’s fractious parliamentary democracy, where the prime minister wields the most power.
One of a president’s main responsibilities is to grant a candidate the task of forming a government after elections. In Israel’s current, fragmented politics, which have produced four inconclusive elections in two years, that involves more than the usual level of skill, legal interpretation and discretion.
The president can also play an important role in Israeli diplomacy and has the power to pardon convicted criminals and exercise clemency by reducing or commuting sentences.

“Our challenges are many and should not be taken lightly,” Mr. Herzog said in his acceptance speech. “I intend to be the president of all Israelis, to lend an attentive ear to every position and respect every person.”

Less than a month ago, an eruption of intense fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip plunged Israeli and Palestinian communities into chaos. As the civilian casualties grew, overwhelmingly on the Gaza side, the conflict polarized Israeli society, and the world, in ways seldom seen before.
At <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 230 people</span> were killed in Gaza during the war, including at <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 65 children</span>, while in Israel at <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 12 were</span> killed, including two children. Gaza’s infrastructure, already ailing, was gutted by Israeli airstrikes on the densely populated territory. And Israeli towns and cities within range of Hamas rockets went into repeated, frightening lockdowns in shelters.
The war also spurred unrest within Israel and the occupied territories that has been more explosive than any in years. It has inspired a new era of Palestinian activism, and has shifted the ground politically, coloring the drama that was playing out in Israel on Wednesday.
Here is what to know about the 11-day war, and its lasting effects.
JERUSALEM — For Israelis, the possible downfall of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the country’s longest-serving leader, is an epochal moment. Israeli media have barraged their audiences with reports and commentary on the opposition attempts to form a government.
But for many Palestinians, the political drama has prompted little more than a shrug and a resurgence of bitter memories.
During Mr. Netanyahu’s current 12-year tenure, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process fizzled, as Israeli and Palestinian leaders accused each other of obstructing the process, and Mr. Netanyahu expressed increasing skepticism about the possibility of a sovereign Palestinian state.
But to many Palestinians, his likely replacement as prime minister, Naftali Bennett, would be no improvement. Mr. Bennett is Mr. Netanyahu’s former chief of staff, and a former settler leader who outright rejects Palestinian statehood.
Instead, many Palestinians are consumed by their own political moment, which some activists have framed as the most pivotal in decades.
The Palestinian polity has long been physically and politically fragmented between the American-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank; its archrival, Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza; a Palestinian minority inside Israel whose votes might make or break an Israeli government; and a sprawling diaspora.
But spurred by last month’s 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and the worst bout of intercommunal Arab-Jewish violence to have convulsed Israel in decades, these disparate parts suddenly came together in a seemingly leaderless eruption of shared identity and purpose.
In a rare display of unity, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians observed a general strike on <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 12 across</span> Gaza, the West Bank, the refugee camps of Lebanon and inside Israel itself.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“I don’t think whoever is in charge in Israel will make a great deal of difference to the Palestinians,” said Ahmad Aweidah, the former head of the Palestinian stock exchange.</span> “There might be slight differences and nuances, but all mainstream Israeli parties, with slight exceptions on the extreme left, share pretty much the same ideology.”
The strike in mid-May, Mr. Aweidah said, “showed that we are united no matter what the Israelis have tried to do <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 73 years</span>: categorizing us into Israeli Arabs, West Bankers, Jerusalemites, Gazans, refugees and diaspora.”
“None of that has worked,” he said. “We are back to square one.”",,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,4,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,

May’s increase was driven in part by sharp rises in the prices for energy, which <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 34.6% from</span> a year earlier, and groceries, which <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">jumped 11.9% on</span> the year, the biggest increase <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1979.</span></span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">But inflation pressures were distinctly broad-based in May, said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.

</span>“Given everything from the implications of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Chinese lockdowns and just the sheer appetite for travel...what we’ve seen is the perfect storm of those factors hitting, along with some major refinery closures,” she said. “Inflationary pressures were seen nearly everywhere.”

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The inflation news hit stock and bond prices, with investors’ fearing the Federal Reserve could be forced to act more aggressively to tame surging price increases.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Prices for used cars and trucks—a key engine of the past year’s inflation surge—<span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 1.8% in</span> May from April, reversing three months of declines.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Shelter costs, an indicator of broad inflation pressures, accelerated on a monthly basis in May and were <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 5.5%,</span> compared with a year ago.

</span>Airline fares <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 12.6% on</span> the month, the third straight double-digit rise.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">“We suspect that the formidable momentum in inflation could push the headline rate for CPI close <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 9% as</span> early as next month,” said Ms. House, adding that it is likely to stay near those levels through the autumn.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">The May inflation figures came as consumer sentiment soured further on the economy.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The preliminary estimate of the consumer sentiment index published Friday by the University of Michigan fell <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 50.2 in</span> June <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 58.4 in</span> May, marking its lowest reading on record.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Nearly half of those surveyed attributed their negative views to inflation, up <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 38% the</span> prior month, and long-term inflation expectations rose to the highest level <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span>

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">High inflation is a downside of strong U.S. growth, fueled in part by low interest rates and government stimulus to counter the Covid-19 pandemic’s impact.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The annual rate of inflation has risen sharply since <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2021,</span> when the U.S. economy’s rebound from the pandemic accelerated, leading to supply disruptions and other imbalances that put upward pressure on prices for longer than policy makers anticipated.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">The Fed faces the difficult task of tightening monetary policy enough to cool the economy and calm inflation, while avoiding a recession.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Fed officials on <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 4 lifted</span> rates by a half-percentage point and will meet again next week to consider a similar increase.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">Economists and policy makers had been watching closely for signs that inflationary pressures are ebbing.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">But May’s resurgence in price increases ratchets up pressure on the Fed to raise rates aggressively to tame inflation, said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">“The breadth of inflation pressures in the economy should alarm the Fed,” he said.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">On a monthly basis, the CPI jumped a seasonally <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">adjusted 1% in</span> May after <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rising 0.3% in</span> the prior month.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">The so-called core-price index, which excludes the often volatile categories of food and energy, <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">increased 0.6% on</span> the month, the same as in April.</span> That compares with an average monthly gain <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 0.2% for</span> both measures in the two years before the pandemic.

<span id=""22"" class=""red"">On a 12-month basis, the core-price index <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">increased 6% in</span> May, down <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 6.2% in</span> April.</span> March’<span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 6.5% rise</span> was the highest rate since <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">August 1982.</span>

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Inflation was highest in the South, <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 9.2%,</span> and the Midwest, where prices <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 8.8%.</span></span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Residents of the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater area of Florida swallowed <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">an 11.3% increase</span> over <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 12 months</span> ended in May, driven in part by a sharp rise in rental prices.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Inflation was <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 6.3% in</span> the New York City metropolitan area, due in part to relatively low rental-price gains.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">“I understand inflation is a real challenge to American families,” said President Biden, speaking at the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, Calif.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">He added the administration would do “everything we can to lower prices for the American people and Congress has to act,” and cited efforts to reduce backlogs of supplies at U.S. ports.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Energy prices rose in May as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continued to push up prices for crude-oil and natural gas.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">Gasoline prices have breached record levels in recent weeks.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">The average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gas in the U.S. <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">hit $5 Friday</span> night, according to OPIS, an energy-data and analytics provider.

</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">The strength in energy price rises will keep putting upward pressure on inflation, said Ms. House, the Wells Fargo economist.

</span>Consumers’ grocery bills have risen by an annual rate of more <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10% since</span> earlier this year, a pace last seen in the early 1980s. <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Food price increases are unusually broad, and every single grocery category measured in the report rose in May from a year ago—most of them by double digits.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">There are numerous causes, unlike early in the pandemic when meat prices drove much of the increase, said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.

</span>“It’s not just the weather—it’s diseases affecting citrus trees and chickens. <span id=""34"" class=""red"">It’s the Ukraine conflict,” which has affected prices for baked goods and cereals, he said.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">Drought, too, is hitting prices for vegetables and other crops.

</span>“For people on lower incomes, this is not discretionary spending,” Mr. Ashworth said. “Other than substituting out cheaper food types—cheaper meat cuts, whatever it might be—people need to continue buying food.”

<span id=""36"" class=""red"">Price pressures are strong across much of the economy in part because of an unusually tight U.S. labor market, with demand for workers outstripping supply.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">Employers <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">added 390,000 jobs</span> last month, and the unemployment rate hovered near a half-century low.</span> <span id=""38"" class=""red"">Still, even after the economy gained more <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 6.5 million</span> jobs in the space of a year, fewer Americans are employed as a share of the population than before the pandemic.

</span><span id=""39"" class=""red"">Those dynamics are driving wage growth, adding to inflationary pressures.</span> <span id=""40"" class=""red"">Strong gains in wages and hiring are pumping more money into Americans’ bank accounts, propping up demand as inflation erodes spending power for many.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, higher labor costs stemming from worker shortages are prompting many employers to raise prices.

</span><span id=""42"" class=""red"">Demand for travel and other services has surged as the impact of Covid-19 recedes and people spend more freely on experiences they missed out on during the worst of the pandemic.</span> <span id=""43"" class=""red"">This is pushing up prices for these services.</span> <span id=""44"" class=""red"">Airline fares <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">surged 37.8% from</span> a year ago, while hotel prices <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 19.3% higher</span>.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">Restaurant prices <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 7.4%,</span> the sharpest rise <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1981.</span>

</span><span id=""46"" class=""red"">Despite strong demand for summer activities such as travel, higher prices are eating into many business owners’ profitability.</span> In <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2020,</span> Suzanne Hoffman, an author who runs wine tours in Italy, canceled group tours to Piedmont because of the pandemic. A number of guests rolled over their deposits and are finally taking their trips this summer.

<span id=""47"" class=""red"">“The demand is there; people are just champing at the bit,” said Ms. Hoffman, who is based in Edwards, Colo.

</span><span id=""48"" class=""red"">But the people taking those long-delayed trips are <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paying 2019 prices</span>, she said, while fuel, dining and other costs to conduct the tours have gone up.</span> That is hurting Ms. Hoffman’s bottom line to the extent that she might stop running future tours given the uncertain outlook.

“I canceled my October tour. I just don’t want to make any commitments beyond this summer,” she said.

<span id=""49"" class=""red"">Some main drivers of inflation could be easing.

</span><span id=""50"" class=""red"">The backlog in cargo ships waiting to unload in Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., fell for the fourth straight month in May, said Oren Klachkin of Oxford Economics.</span> Target Corp. recently said the need to unload unwanted goods would cause its profit to drop. Clothes retailers have also been caught with swelling inventories of casual clothes and home items as shoppers scaled back spending on goods that had been popular throughout the pandemic.

<span id=""51"" class=""red"">But supply bottlenecks are easing too slowly and too sporadically to ease inflationary pressures, economists say.</span> <span id=""52"" class=""red"">Energy disruptions caused by the Ukraine war and the lack of workers to fill vacancies in the U.S. are exacerbating strains on the economy’s ability to meet demand without price rises.

</span><span id=""53"" class=""red"">The breadth and persistence of these supply problems means that for inflation to ease, demand must come down, said Mr. Knightley of ING.</span> <span id=""54"" class=""red"">“To get demand into better balance with the supply the onus is on the Federal Reserve to do the heavy lifting,” he said.

Dec.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 11</span>:00 pm ET

NINGDE, China—The price of nickel, a metal used to make stainless steel for everything from sauce pans to guitar strings, spiked <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past $50,000 a</span> metric ton <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007 from</span> less <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $10,000 just</span> a few years earlier.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">With nickel largely controlled by Western companies, China's swelling economy was especially vulnerable—until some of its steel producers figured out how to substitute a lower-grade ""nickel pig iron,"" unlocking a mother lode of cheap supply.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The innovation has sent nickel prices tumbling to less <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $14,000 a</span> metric ton, and turned China into a leading nickel producer.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The country now turns out more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 400,000 metric</span> tons of nickel pig iron a year, equal to a fifth of world-wide demand.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Economists for years warned that rising demand for natural resources by China and other emerging markets would outstrip supply, leaving the world short of everything from nickel to coal, copper and corn.

</span>But a remarkable period of innovation and investment has produced a far different picture. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Expanded supply has helped moderate commodity prices over the past year after a decade of demand from China helped push many prices into the stratosphere.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The International Monetary Fund's index of all commodity prices is down <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 12% from</span> recent peaks; it had roughly tripled <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Between 2000 and</span></span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2011.</span></span> Copper is <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 28% from</span> its record high <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span> while thermal coal has fallen by more than half since <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2008 peak</span>.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Of course, price declines are also driven by weaker demand, especially in China, where economic growth has slowed.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">And prices for many commodities, including oil, remain far above their average <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 10 or</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 15 years</span> ago.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">But the global supply picture is the best in years.</span> ""It's kind of basic econ 101: Scarcity induces some sort of innovation,"" said David Jacks, an associate professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who has studied commodity cycles over the past century.

The most widely known innovation is the oil-field technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which fueled the shale boom by injecting water and other materials into the earth to unlock oil and natural gas.

But in agriculture, farmers are tapping new patches of arable land, and turning to higher-yielding hybrid seeds.

In the mining industry, drilling companies are using diamond-coated drill bits to reach miles farther beneath the earth's surface. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">They also employ aircraft radar to map the geology of remote areas.</span> Firms that mix chemicals into minerals to make desired metals rise to the top or sink to the bottom now extract more product than ever from lower-grade deposits.

On top of all that, many projects that were funded years ago—including new or expanded copper, silver and nickel mines—have started producing.

As as result, mine production has nearly doubled or tripled for every major metal over the past two decades, according to the U.S. Geological Survey and other organizations.

<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Between 2000 and</span></span><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012,</span> aluminum output increased <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 45.7 million</span> metric tons <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 24.7 million</span>, according to the Raw Materials Group Stockholm, a consultancy. Production of iron ore, used in steelmaking, hit two billion metric tons from <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 975 million</span> over the same period.

Global production of corn, meanwhile, rose by <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 270 million</span> metric tons over the past decade, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. That growth was the biggest 10-year increase on record and more than triple the gains of the previous decade.

Output of palm oil, used in cookies and instant noodles, has more than doubled since the start of the last decade, and so has the harvest of walnuts and almonds.

All this expanded production has often come with environmental costs, which in various places include air pollution, clear-cut forests and water tainted by chemicals.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">And it remains unclear how the world can sustain the commodity-production gains still needed to meet future demand.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Per capita consumption of energy and other resources in China remains lower than in the West, which means more production increases will be needed in the future as the Chinese economy grows.</span> Many easy-to-reach minerals have been exhausted, likely raising future production costs.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">But innovations of the past decade show how market signals help unlock new supply.</span> The period compares with advances in copper production during the 1920s, Mr. Jacks said. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">And demand during World War II led to the expansion of synthetic rubber production.

</span>Minerals companies, for example, have improved the chemical process to extract raw materials from waste rock. Rio Tinto in Utah extracts silver, gold and molybdenum from the muddy sludge that is a byproduct of mining copper. In Minnesota, a company called Magnetation Inc. has developed machines that use magnets to extract iron ore from mining waste.

China's nickel production is one of the most dramatic examples of fresh thinking. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">In the early 2000s, prices were <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $10,000 per</span> metric ton.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Then China's economy took off, along with new demand for stainless steel, which requires nickel and iron.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Nickel prices <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">surpassed $51,000 per</span> ton in mid-2007.

</span>Chinese stainless steel producers were furious, especially since much of the world's nickel supplies were dominated by such foreign companies as BHP Billiton Ltd., Vale SA of Brazil, and Russia's MMC Norilsk Nickel.

Most nickel production at the time came from so-called sulfide deposits in places like Canada and Russia, where mines were being depleted.

There were plenty of lower-grade laterite deposits in Indonesia and elsewhere. It could be refined into nickel pig iron, which contains a relatively small portion of nickel—usually less than 15%—mixed with iron. But processing the laterite ore required lots of energy and created lots of pollution.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">Analysts figured it <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cost $20,000 or</span> more per metric ton to make nickel pig iron, more than double the market price for nickel in the early 2000s.</span> Mining companies often tossed laterite nickel aside.

<span id=""19"" class=""red"">But when nickel prices climbed, China saw a competitive advantage: it still had scores of old, inefficient blast furnaces.</span> Beijing had been pressing steelmakers to shut them down. But with some fine-tuning, the blast furnaces could refine laterite ore into nickel pig iron, which can be used to make some steel alloys, including stainless steel.

Early Chinese producers burned coal, oil, wood chips and other materials to refine the laterite, which came mostly from Indonesia. The final product had only a small amount of nickel, but also iron, both needed ingredients.

<span id=""20"" class=""red"">As prices continued to climb, nickel pig iron became economical, and furnaces along China's eastern coast were put to work.

</span>The Tsingshan Holding Group was among the leaders. As one of China's major producers of stainless steel, it needed lots of nickel.

The company was encouraged by early trials with nickel pig iron, but the refining process was still crude and dirty. So Tsingshan began experiments, including at a plant near Ningde, a coastal town in Fujian province surrounded by low green mountains and grape farms.

The company tried rotary kiln electric furnaces, which use less energy than blast furnaces and can extract more nickel from the ore.

Many people were skeptical, said John Li, a Tsingshan-subsidiary vice president in Ningde. One day, he said, a furnace started leaking iron slag everywhere.

But the process eventually succeeded, trimming electricity needs by as much <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 40%,</span> said Jiang Xinfang, president-director of another Tsingshan subsidiary in Shanghai. Tsingshan now pumps out nickel pig iron <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 11% nickel</span>, the company said, compared <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 2% or</span> less using older techniques.

""At its core, this is a sort of revolution in the way nickel units are made,"" said Andrew Shaw, a commodities analyst at Credit Suisse in Singapore.

Tsingshan now gets about half the nickel it needs from its own nickel pig iron, Mr. Li said. At its Ningde-area operations, a port unloads ships of Indonesian ore, which is piled in tall dark-brown mounds that cover an area roughly the size of a football field.

<span id=""21"" class=""red"">Later, the ore is transferred to a smelting plant where it is fed into a tangle of rust-colored pipes, smokestacks and rotating kilns for conversion into liquid nickel pig iron.

</span>A blanket of foul-smelling smog envelops areas near Tsingshan's operation, though there are many other factories nearby, making it hard to know where all the pollution comes from. Some residents blame the pig iron plant.

Analysts say mining of Indonesian ore involves destructive stripping of the land in that country, as well.

But the rotary-kiln process has made refining significantly cleaner, according to analysts. Mr. Jiang at Tsingshan said his company's newest-generation operations include antidust equipment and low-sulfur coal.

Tsingshan's breakthroughs have been replicated across China. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">As nickel pig iron technology has improved, analysts say, the cost of processing it has fallen to as low <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $12,500 per</span> metric ton.

</span>""There's been this huge deflationary effect on the nickel industry as nickel pig iron has developed,"" said Gayle Berry, an analyst at Barclays in London. ""It certainly has destroyed the world"" for traditional nickel, added Jim Lennon, a nickel expert and consultant to Australia's Macquarie Bank, though supplies could tighten again in the future.

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">One concern for producers is that Indonesia may restrict exports of nickel ore next year to entice mining companies to build refining operations there.</span> Tsingshan is one of several companies taking steps to do so.

<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, Western miners are scrambling to deal with the new supply.</span> Analysts estimated that as much <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 40% of</span> the nickel mining industry is losing money these days. <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Some predict China will keep finding ways to supply its own needs.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive of Glencore-Xstrata, the world's fourth-largest nickel miner, said earlier this year he was pessimistic about the metal's future price.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">In October, his company announced it would mothball its Falcondo mine in the Dominican Republic because of falling nickel prices, eliminating as many <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 1,000 jobs</span>.</span> The company mines nickel ore in five countries, including Indonesia and sells much of it to China to make nickel pig iron.

""China is becoming self-sufficient"" in nickel, said Vladimir Potanin, chief executive of Norilsk, the world's top nickel producer. ""They are producing steel, which they need for their industrial development. They need this nickel pig iron close to where the steel is made. I think they're smart enough, and powerful enough to keep doing both forever.""

Mr. Li, of the Tsingshan subsidiary, was pleased with his country's revamping of nickel production, with benefits extending around the world. ""If we didn't have this nickel process in China,"" he said. <span id=""28"" class=""red"">""I think prices would <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">be $80,000.</span></span>""

Updated Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2022 11</span>:10 am ET

The U.K.’s annual rate of inflation moved into double digits in July and is set to rise even higher by the end of the year, heaping greater pressure on stretched household budgets and threatening a lengthy economic contraction.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">That pickup in inflation has been replicated in other parts of Europe, even as consumer prices have started to slow in the U.S.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">That is because energy prices have continued to accelerate across Europe as Russia withholds supplies of natural gas, with the continent facing a possible crunch this winter.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The U.K.’s Office for National Statistics Wednesday said consumer prices <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 10.1% higher</span> in July than a year earlier, up <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 9.4% in</span> June.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">That was the highest rate of inflation in more than four decades and the fastest increase in prices recorded in one of the Group of Seven rich countries since the current surge started in <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2021.</span>

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">“Inflation figures continue to paint a worrying picture for consumers and businesses alike, and price pressures are set to build further,” said Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the Confederation of British Industry.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Figures to be released Thursday by the European Union’s statistics agency are expected to show the eurozone’s annual rate of inflation rose <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 8.9% in</span> July <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 8.6% in</span> June.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">By contrast, U.S. inflation eased <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 8.5% in</span> July <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 9.1% in</span> June.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Economists at JPMorgan see increasing signs that global inflation is set to ease, with prices of food and many commodities down from recent peaks.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">However, they expect that disinflation to be evident first in the U.S., with Europe set to lag behind despite some recent easing in the prices of goods leaving factory gates.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">“Europe, however, faces ongoing pressure from surging natural gas prices that have more than doubled over the past three months,” they wrote in a note to clients.</span> “We expect the combined drag of a squeeze on purchasing power and depressed sentiment to tip the region into recession this year.”

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">July is unlikely to mark the peak in U.K. inflation, since household energy costs are set to rise sharply when a cap on prices is lifted in October.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The Bank of England estimates that could send the annual rate of inflation <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 13% as</span> the year draws to a close.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">The U.K. is suffering a particularly severe surge in prices in part because of <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 2016 decision</span> to leave the European Union, which has caused costs for importers to increase, while a weaker pound has also raised the prices of goods and services purchased overseas.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Brexit has also reduced the availability of foreign workers in some lower-paid services industries, such as hospitality, pushing costs and prices higher.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">However, the U.K. might not be the only one of Europe’s three G-7 members set to face the double-digit inflation that has already hit Spain, Greece and a number of the EU’s eastern members.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Germany’s gas regulator Monday announced a surcharge on gas prices designed to cover most of the increased costs to home energy suppliers since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Economists estimate that will send Germany’s annual rate of inflation <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 10% from</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7.5% in</span> July.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">U.K. figures released Tuesday by the ONS showed wages excluding bonuses <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 4.7% higher</span> in the three months through June than a year earlier, a pickup from <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 4.4% rate</span> of growth recorded in the three months through May.

Much of the pickup came from the private sector, where wages were <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5.</span>9% when</span> bonuses are included.</span> Many businesses are giving workers one-off payments to help cover surging energy and food costs, as well as standard pay rises. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Labor union Unite on Monday said British Airways had agreed to pay its check-in staff a lump sum equivalent <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 5% of</span> their salaries this month, with a <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">regular 5% pay</span> rise to follow in September, and a <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">further 3% increase</span> in January.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">“Like most other workers, our members in BA are struggling with the cost of living crisis,” said Oliver Richardson, a Unite official.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">The acceleration in wage rises will worry the Bank of England, which wants to avert a self-reinforcing series of wage and price rises of the kind that kept inflation high for many years in the 1970s.

</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Investors now expect the central bank to raise its key interest rate by a half percentage point when policy makers next meet in mid-September, having broken with a quarter-century tradition of only increasing borrowing costs by a quarter point in each step earlier this month.

</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">“Today’s ugly inflation print combined with the stronger earnings read should keep the MPC on track to deliver multiple 50bps hikes this year,” said Sanjay Raja, an economist at Deutsche Bank.</span> “Relative to our base case, risks are tilted to an even more front-loaded and protracted hiking cycle.”

<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Even as it picked up, wage growth fell further behind the rate of inflation, with the result that real wages <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 4.1%,</span> the largest decline since records began <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2001.</span></span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">That blow to consumer spending threatens to push the economy into an even deeper contraction than the central bank already expects.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">The European Central Bank is also seeking to strike a balance between tackling surging inflation and limiting the hit to the eurozone economy from higher energy prices.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">It also broke with recent practice by raising its key rate by a half percentage point in July, and many economists expect it to repeat that move next month.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">The U.K. government has already announced three packages of support to help households meet higher energy bills without having to cut back on other essentials, but economists expect a fourth package to follow the election of a new prime minister early next month.

</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">The government’s response to what has become known as the cost-of-living crisis has been on hold since Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ousted as head of the ruling Conservative Party in early July, and the lengthy process of choosing his successor is due to end on Sept.<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5.</span>

</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">“We’ll prepare all the options, ready for the incoming prime minister so that they can hit the ground running on what more we can do,” said Nadhim Zahawi, the U.K.’s Treasury chief.

</span>The German government, and others in Europe, are also considering additional support for households that face skyrocketing energy costs.

“We’re putting together another relief package,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote in a tweet Monday. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">“We don’t leave anyone alone with the higher costs.”

66690684db06fb05c2766266,88390,"<h3>Inside Mitch McConnell’s decades-long effort to block gun control</h3>Mitch McConnell was just finishing up his first term as the junior senator from Kentucky when a mass shooting rocked his hometown of Louisville.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">On Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1989,</span> a disgruntled employee entered the Standard Gravure printing plant in downtown Louisville and, armed with an AK-47 and other guns, killed eight and <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">wounded 12 others</span> before taking his own life — in what remains the deadliest mass shooting in the state’s history.

</span>At the time, mass shootings had not yet become the staple of American life that they are now, and McConnell said he was “deeply disturbed,” declaring, “We must take action to stop such vicious crimes.”

But he also added: “We need to be careful about legislating in the middle of a crisis.” And in the days and weeks after, he did not join others in calling for a ban on assault weapons like the AK-47 used by the shooter.

The Standard Gravure massacre provided an early glimpse of how McConnell — now the Republican Senate minority leader — would handle mass shootings and their aftermath over the next three decades, consistently working to delay, obstruct or prevent most major gun-control legislation from passing Congress.

McConnell would go on to follow a similar playbook time and time again during his seven terms in Congress, offering vague promises of action, often without any specifics, only to be followed by no action or incremental measures that avoided new gun regulations. As a Republican leader, he also helped dissuade his conference — as after <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2012 mass</span> shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. — from supporting gun legislation and, as majority leader, refused to bring up significant gun-control measures for a vote.

Now, the latest devastating and high-profile mass shootings — a massacre Tuesday at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Tex., that <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">left 19 students</span> and two teachers dead, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 10 days</span> after a racist slaughter at Buffalo supermarket that <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">killed 10 </span>— have thrust Congress back into a fiery debate over what, if anything, lawmakers can do to curb gun violence.

On Thursday, McConnell told CNN that he had encouraged Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) to reach out to Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) — who made gun control a personal project after Sandy Hook — to begin discussing what bipartisan measures might be possible.

But many Democrats and anti-gun advocates remain skeptical, predicting that McConnell and his fellow Republicans are poised to obstruct any consequential gun-violence-prevention bills yet again.

“If there’s any one individual in the United States to blame for our inability to put things in place to prevent gun violence, it’s Mitch McConnell,” said Peter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords, a group devoted to fighting gun violence. “McConnell understands he’s hostage to that extreme base that just doesn’t tolerate any departure from any of their views.”

Many Republicans say that McConnell is less a singular obstacle than a savvy leader who is able to his read his conference and make decisions that help his senators and protect them politically. “McConnell knows where his members stand and makes the tough calls to protect their interests,” a senior Republican aide said, explaining McConnell’s overall motivations in addressing gun violence and gun legislation.

McConnell declined to comment.

<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1990,</span> the year after the Standard Gravure shooting, McConnell was up for reelection and found himself in a close race with Democrat Harvey Sloane, then the Jefferson County judge executive and a former Louisville mayor, who had called for banning assault weapons.

<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2013,</span> following Sandy Hook, Sloane recounted in Louisville’s Courier-Journal newspaper that as his race with McConnell tightened in the final stretch, McConnell and the National Rifle Association “blistered the state falsely as to how this ban would eventually take away ‘your hunting gun and the hand pistol you need for personal protection.’ ”

McConnell defeated Sloane by five percentage points and, in his second term in the Senate, went on to vote against both the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1993 and</span> the Federal Assault Weapons Ban <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1994.</span>

“Mitch is really Machiavellian,” Sloane said in an interview with The Washington Post last week. “He’s single-handedly held up any kind of gun legislation that’s meaningful.”

‘It didn’t change a thing’

In <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2019,</span> a group of gun-control advocates — including Kris Brown, the president of Brady, a gun violence prevention organization; Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights icon; and Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.), who lost her 17-year-old son in <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2012 shooting</span> — gathered on the West Lawn of the Capitol for a rally in favor of tougher background checks.

After the rally, some in the group — which also included some McConnell constituents — decided to make their way to the then-majority leader’s office for what Lewis might have called “good trouble.”

“So we walked over, John Lewis kind of leading us, talking about the importance of peaceful resistance,” Brown recalled, adding that Lewis asked if someone should get Depends — a brand of adult diapers — because the group might be there for a while.

“His staffers had no idea what to do with us,” Brown said. “McConnell didn’t have the human decency to sit down with John Lewis.”

Instead, a McConnell staffer ushered the group into a conference room and met with them for over an hour. Brown said that the staffer clearly seemed moved by Lewis, telling him that she held him in high esteem, and by the victims of gun violence, who recounted their stories one after another.

“She was moved to tears, but it didn’t change a thing,” Brown said, saying the staffer essentially told the group “that it was just the wrong time to bring this bill forward.”

Doug Andres, a McConnell spokesman, said McConnell had been unable to meet with the group at the time because it was a surprise visit and he already had constituent meetings planned. He said the staffer simply explained to the group that then-President Donald Trump was unlikely to sign the bill they were pitching, and McConnell was not going to advocate for legislation he knew would fail.

For McConnell, however, the time has rarely seemed right.

Almost immediately after Sandy Hook, then-President Barack Obama tasked then-Vice President Joe Biden with putting together a robust policy response. McConnell — then the Senate minority leader — downplayed the effort.

Asked about gun-control issues on ABC’s “This Week” in <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2013 </span>— less than month after Sandy Hook — <span id=""1"" class=""red"">McConnell said he was waiting to see Biden’s proposal but did not plan to prioritize it over other issues like “spending and debt” in the coming months.

</span>Then, later that month — after Obama <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">signed 23 executive</span> orders on guns in response to the tragedy that <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">left 20 kindergartners</span> dead — McConnell recorded a robocall and sent it out to gun owners in his state.

“President Obama and his team are doing everything in their power to restrict your constitutional right to keep and bear arms,” McConnell said in the recording. “Their efforts to restrict your rights, invading your personal privacy and overstepping their bounds with executive orders, is just plain wrong.”

McConnell also refused a meeting with the Sandy Hook families, according to someone familiar with the request, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal details. But eventually, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W. Va.) and Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) negotiated a modest bipartisan background checks bill, known as Manchin-Toomey.

At the time, McConnell was still adjusting to the rise of the hard-right tea party movement in the Republican base; in <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2010 Republican</span> Senate primary in Kentucky, Rand Paul vanquished Trey Grayson, McConnell’s handpicked candidate, by riding the tea party wave in what some also viewed as a stinging rebuke of McConnell. And <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2013,</span> McConnell was already preparing for <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2014 reelection</span> bid.

When Manchin-Toomey finally came to the Senate floor for a vote in <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2013,</span> McConnell pushed his conference to oppose the bill, which ultimately <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">failed 54 to</span><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 46,</span> falling short of <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 60 votes</span> needed for passage.

“McConnell whipped hard against it. McConnell is obsessed with protecting his right flank,” said Adam Jentleson, who at the time worked for then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), explaining why McConnell helped tank the background check bill. “It’s why he’s been able to survive as leader for so long.”

Jesse Benton — a conservative activist who managed Paul’<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2010 Senate</span> campaign and who McConnell enlisted to manage <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2014 one</span> — said that McConnell at the time “said something to me like, ‘I hope you know I’m not planning on supporting any of this crap.' ”

“He’s not a firebrand like some of the [pro-gun] activists want, but he makes it clear to his team that he is a Second Amendment believer,” Benton said. “He respects the legislative process and the fact that there are differing opinions in his own caucus, but he works it in his own way, as only he can.”

McConnell was, at other times, willing to entertain the idea of some legislation on guns, partly as a way of releasing pressure from members of his caucus who wanted to show some legislative action after mass shootings.

But that approach has also earned him the ire of some Second Amendment advocates, some of whom ran ads against him during <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2014 primary</span>.

“When the going gets tough, Mitch McConnell has always been absent from the fight,” said Dudley Brown, the president of the National Association for Gun Rights, a hard-line alternative to the NRA. “He has never stood up when it was really tough.”

‘An obstacle to taking any action’

For McConnell,<span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 opened</span> with a mass shooting at Marshall County High School near Benton, Ky., where a 15-year-old student killed two and injured more than a dozen others that January. The following month, another school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">left 17 dead</span> and drew yet another national outcry for stronger gun measures.

At the time, Trump offered messaging whiplash. In a meeting with Democratic and Republican lawmakers two weeks after Parkland, he called for “comprehensive” gun legislation and chided Republicans for being “petrified” of the NRA. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But the next day, he hosted an NRA lobbyist in the Oval Office, declared the meeting “great” on Twitter and seemed to lose interest in working on gun legislation.

</span>Still, a McConnell aide said, the combination of the Florida and Kentucky school shootings prompted McConnell, by then the Senate majority leader, to help pass two modest bills on background checks (the Fix NICS Act) and school safety (the Stop School Violence Act).

The Fix NICS Act helped improve the criminal background checks system to make background checks more thorough and accurate, and the stopping school violence measure authorized additional funding for improving school security and early intervention and school violence prevention programs.

Another big push for gun legislation came in the summer <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2019,</span> following back-to-back shootings on Aug.<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 and</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4 at</span> a Walmart Supercenter in majority-Hispanic El Paso and in a nightlife corridor in Dayton, Ohio, which left a <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">combined 23 people</span> dead and dozens more injured.

The Democratic blowback was fierce and directed squarely at McConnell — who was again campaigning for reelection — since the House had already passed a background check bill.

“I hope that Sen. McConnell would bring the Senate back tomorrow and pass the background check bill and send it to the president,” Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown said after the shootings.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">The same day, Shannon Watts of Moms Demand Action, a gun violence prevention group, declared, “We need Mitch McConnell to allow a vote.”

</span>The Twitter account of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) retweeted both statements, and several days later, Pelosi wrote a public letter to Trump asking him to call on McConnell — whom she described as “an obstacle to taking any action” — to call the Senate back into session.

By the night of Aug.<span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,</span> protesters had gathered outside McConnell’s Kentucky home with profane chants. Days later, dozens gathered outside his Louisville office.

That Thursday, Aug.<span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span> McConnell went on Louisville’s WHAS-AM radio to say he had spoken with Trump and was ready to take action. The president, he said, was “anxious to get an outcome, and so am I.”

“What we can’t do is fail to pass something,” McConnell said. “What I want to see here is an outcome.”

He added that background checks — which he said had “a lot of support” publicly — and red flag measures would probably lead the discussion.

But a special session was never called.

The week before returning to Washington, McConnell did an interview with Hugh Hewitt on Sept.<span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 that</span> laid out a different benchmark, deferring to Trump: “I said several weeks ago that if the president took a position on a bill so that we knew we would actually be making a law and not just having serial votes, I’d be happy to put it on the floor.”

By the time McConnell brought the Senate back in session, his focus had shifted. In his first remarks on the Senate floor, McConnell made no mention of the gun issue. Just over a week later, The Post reported on a whistleblower complaint about Trump’s communications with a foreign leader, eventually leading to Trump’s first impeachment for his efforts to withhold military aid to Ukraine — drawing Trump’s attention away from guns.

This past Wednesday, the day after the devastating Uvalde elementary school shooting, McConnell — now the Senate minority leader again — took to the Senate floor to declare himself and the nation “sickened and outraged by the senseless evil” that left at <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 19 students</span> and two teachers “murdered for no apparent reason at all.”

He did not mention guns or any possible legislation, instead focusing on the “innocent young lives” that were prematurely extinguished.

“Words simply fail,” McConnell said.

On Thursday, however, McConnell tasked Cornyn with negotiating with Democrats.

“Maybe this will provide some impetus” for compromise, Cornyn told reporters at the Capitol on Thursday. “This is horrible. Hard to imagine anything that could be worse than parents worrying about the safety of their kids going to school.”

But most Republicans signaled in recent days that major legislation remains unlikely.

“There are no right words to describe the heartbreaking and horrific tragedy that happened at Robb Elementary School,” said Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), before adding later: “We must be thoughtful about how we discuss and handle school safety and mental health issues. Federal changes should not be made in haste, and there’s still many details we do not know as the investigation continues.”

After a vigil for the Uvalde victims, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) stormed away from an interview when a British reporter asked him why mass shootings happen “only in America.” Cruz accused the reporter of having a “political agenda.”

Cruz also dismissed Democratic gun violence prevention proposals, saying that none of them would have stopped the Uvalde shooting, and later suggested legislation to “harden schools” — such as having only one usable door.

On Friday, Trump — still the de facto leader of the Republican Party — joined other Republican officials in delivering a defiant response to the Uvalde massacre at an NRA annual meeting in Houston, arguing that new gun restrictions were pointless.

Support for stricter gun laws has increased after mass shootings at schools. In <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2018,</span> shortly after the Parkland shooting,<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 67 percent</span> said in a Gallup Poll that laws should be more strict — an increase <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 60 percent</span> who said the same in <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2017.</span> Similarly, support for stricter laws jumped <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 43 percent</span> <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 58 percent</span> after the Sandy Hook shooting.

In contrast to support for gun restrictions in general, support for expanding background checks has stayed very high over time. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">A Pew Research Center poll last year <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">found 81 percent</span> of Americans supported making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks, <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 70 percent</span> of Republicans <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 92 percent</span> of Democrats.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">A 63 percent</span> majority supported a ban on assault-style weapons, <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 83 percent</span> of Democrats and less than half as many Republicans (37 percent).

But many gun-control advocates and Democrats remain skeptical that Republicans are prepared to change their approach. Matt Bennett — a co-founder of Third Way, a Democratic think tank — said polarized politics prevents the handful of Republicans who may privately support some gun safety laws to do so publicly.

“The ones who believe in their hearts that they should do something — and who knows how many there truly are — don’t want to do it, because they don’t want to get crosswise with the base,” Bennett said.

John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, latched onto McConnell’s declaration on the Senate floor that “words simply fail.”

He said he agrees completely.

“I don’t want to mince words. The Republican senators are what is costing American lives. And McConnell is the head of the Republican Senate,” Feinblatt said. “I am encouraged that McConnell gave the green light to Cornyn. That is what I would call step one.”

“But,” he added, “There is no question about it: Inaction is not an option.”

Updated Nov.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 6</span>:57 pm ET

An international race to lower corporate taxes is back in the global spotlight after Britain recommitted to slashing rates and as the election of Donald Trump puts U.S. corporate-tax overhauls on the front burner.

</span>U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday officially endorsed a move by Britain’s previous Conservative government to lower the main corporate rate there <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 17% by</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020,</span> from today’<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 20%.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">President-elect Donald Trump promoted on the campaign trail <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 15% U</span>.S. headline corporate tax-rate—down from the <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">current 35%.</span>

</span>Mr. Trump’s plan is far from a done deal. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">It faces domestic political hurdles and fiscal reality.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">And Mrs. May backed a tax cut already approved by Parliament but stopped short of endorsing her predecessor’s further recommendation—made after the Brexit vote—to go down <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15%.</span>

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Still, the rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic represent the latest volleys in a long tradition of trying to use national corporate-tax codes to spur investment at home or lure foreign firms.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The new attention being paid to corporate tax in both places follows close on the heels of recent moves in Japan, Canada, Italy and France to attract investment with lower rates of their own.

</span>For Britain, the Brexit decision has made the pressure to keep the welcome mat out especially intense. The country, in particular London, has been a magnet for global firms looking to set up European beachheads or global offices. It benefits from a convenient time zone between Asia and the Americas, strong legal protections and a large pool of well-educated, English-speaking workers.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">But after Britain’s <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 23 vote</span> to leave the European Union, many companies based there have scrambled to assess whether they will continue to benefit from two other, big advantages that come with EU membership: unfettered access to Europe’s common market and the free movement of labor across the bloc.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Britain’s Institute of Directors, a group of company directors and senior business leaders, found in a poll shortly after the vote that more than a fifth of respondents said they were considering moving some of their operations outside the U.K. because of the vote.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Mrs. May has tried to assure British and foreign companies that the U.K. will continue to be a competitive place to do business.</span> Her charm offensive has included closed-door meetings with corporate heads such as Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Nissan Motor Co., the second-largest car maker in the U.K. Mr. Ghosn had considered passing over Sunderland and picking a factory in continental Europe to build a new model, but he backtracked after meeting with Mrs. May.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Mrs. May’s announcement, made in a speech to U.K. business leaders, reassured companies that she was still prepared to carry through on the tax reductions approved by Parliament during her predecessor’s government.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">She didn’t mention a specific tax-cutting target.

</span>That left unclear whether she would be willing to embrace a further cut <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15%,</span> which was proposed—but never acted upon—by then-Prime Minister David Cameron’s government in the immediate wake of the Brexit vote. An aide to Mrs. May said only she was committed to the plans already in place to cut the rate <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2020 to</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17%.</span>

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Still, business leaders took it as a strong signal of support for keeping corporate tax low.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">“It’s good to see the government reaffirm its commitment to lower corporation tax,” said a spokesman for the Confederation of British Industry, a trade group.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">The plan to gradually move to <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 17% corporate</span>-tax rate would give Britain the lowest headline corporate-tax rate among the Group <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20,</span> a collection of the world’s richest nations.</span> At the <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">current 20%,</span> its headline rate is already one of the lowest in the G-20, equal to that of Turkey, Russia and Saudi Arabia. <span id=""14"" class=""red""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">At 17%,</span> it would still be above Ireland’<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 12.5%,</span> but well below most other large economies.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">It might also be at the limit of what Britain’s finances can stand.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">“Britain has a large deficit and is very constrained on how much tax-cutting it can do,” said Charles Beer, managing director of independent tax advisory Taxand in Britain.</span> He said the government could speed up implementing <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 17% rate</span>, “but it’s hard to see how they can do a major move down.”

Vodafone Group PLC said in the days immediately after the June vote that it might have to reconsider its U.K. headquarters. It has since backtracked, saying it is happy to be British based. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">A spokesman declined to comment on Mrs. May’s tax pledge.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The race to lower corporate taxes comes amid a broader tax shake-up that has played out over recent years.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Almost 100 countries</span>, including the U.S. and most of Europe, have agreed to close—or at least narrow—legal loopholes that big companies use to shift profits to places where they pay little or no income tax.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">EU regulators have also taken aim at tailor-made tax deals between certain member countries and companies.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">“Once those loopholes are closed the main way countries can compete is by lowering their base corporate tax rate,” said Paolo Giacometti, a partner at Italian law firm Chiomenti.</span> “So we will see this trend continue.”

<span id=""22"" class=""red"">It is often hard to compare corporate-tax rates in an apples-to-apples fashion.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Some countries have wider corporate-tax bases, for instance, or charge different rates for different-sized companies.</span> Companies also have to contend with an array of regional taxes, such as U.S. state taxes. Still, the national rate is often the easiest-to-convey message of welcome—or warning—a government can send to corporate executives.

Germany and Ireland made big cuts at the beginning of this century in a bid to attract corporate investment. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Berlin clawed back much of what it lost in revenue by making it harder for companies to take deductions.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Ireland’s sharp headline corporate-tax cuts early in the decade helped it become one of Europe’s most attractive destinations for many companies looking for European or global headquarters.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">But it is also now pulling back on other corporate-tax benefits.</span> Two years ago, for instance, Dublin said it would end <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2020 a</span> gambit it called the “Double Irish.” <span id=""27"" class=""red"">The structure allowed multinationals to lower their taxable profit in one Irish subsidiary by paying royalties into another Irish-registered subsidiary that was managed in a tax haven—making it exempt from Irish income tax.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Italy in <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2015 moved</span> to lower its national corporate tax rate <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 3.5 percentage</span> points, <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 24%.</span></span> That reduction takes effect next year. Even France, long a holdout, has embraced the trend in the past few years, though rates in the country are still higher than in most of Europe.

Japan, struggling to promote growth as the country’s population ages, has been cutting the rate to encourage investment. This year, the rate <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 2 percentage</span> points <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 30%,</span> bringing the drop <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 10 points</span> in just a few years.

In the U.S., however, the policy debate has been stalled for years, despite bipartisan consensus to lower corporate taxes. <span id=""29"" class=""red"">The U.S. rate is now the world’s highest, though effective tax rates are lower than <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 35% marginal</span> rate.</span> House Republicans have proposed <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 20% rate</span>, saying they want to leapfrog other countries that have been reducing their rates more incrementally. President Barack Obama several years ago proposed <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 28% rate</span> <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 25% for</span> manufacturers.

<span id=""30"" class=""red"">Unlike many other countries, the U.S. doesn’t have a value-added tax—akin to a federal sales tax—that it can increase while cutting the corporate tax rate.</span> <span id=""31"" class=""red"">That means Washington has had to look for offsetting revenue elsewhere.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">All the likely sources—a broader corporate tax base, higher taxes on small businesses and wider budget deficits—are politically problematic.

66690684db06fb05c2766266,28411,"<h3>Pinkerton: Why Buying Greenland Is One of Donald Trump’s Best Ideas</h3>Last week, the Wall Street Journal had a scoop of sorts; the headline read, “President Trump Eyes a New Real-Estate Purchase: Greenland: In conversations with aides, the president has — with varying degrees of seriousness — floated the idea of the U.S. buying the autonomous Danish territory.”
Greenland, of course, is a huge island in the Atlantic, most of it north of the Arctic Circle. As such, even though it <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">boasts 836,000 square</span> miles of territory — more than a quarter the size of the continental U.S. — it counts a population of <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 55,000.</span>
In other words, the great landmass is ripe for development, so it’s no wonder Trump, real estate man, wants to take a crack at developing it — on behalf of the nation, if not for himself. Indeed, wits were quick to riff on what a Trumpified Greenland would look like.
Needless to say, the Journal’s report sparked a wide variety of reactions; the Danish government immediately said “no,” while one New York City tabloid laughed, even as other organs of the mainstream media heaped on their own ridicule. Not surprisingly, one MSNBC talking head went beyond attacking Trump to attack Trump supporters, chortling, “Can anybody at the MAGA rally point out Greenland on a map?”
In response, Trump kept the door open, telling reporters on August 18:
Strategically, it’s interesting, and we’d be interested, but we’ll talk to them a little bit. It’s not number one on the burner.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow added:
We’re looking at it …</span> Greenland is a strategic place. They’ve got a lot of valuable minerals … the president, who knows a thing or two about buying real estate, wants to take a look.
A few others were supportive; Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) tweeted on August 15:
This a smart geopolitical move. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The United States has a compelling strategic interest in Greenland, and this should absolutely be on the table.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Indeed, America’s strategic interest in Greenland has long been recognized.</span> As Foreign Policy magazine noted, the U.S. has tried, twice, to buy Greenland — once after the Civil War and again after World War Two. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">(During WWII, Uncle Sam used Greenland for military basing and supply; to this day, there’s a major Air Force base at Thule, less <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1,000 miles</span> from the North Pole.)
</span>In fact, <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1917,</span> America purchased the Danish West Indies from Denmark; we <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paid $25 million</span>, renaming them the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Indeed, in its history, the U.S. has bought plenty of land, including the Louisiana Territory from the French <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1803 and</span> Alaska from the Russians <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1867.</span> In each case, the pittance Uncle Sam spent was repaid a thousand-fold, not just because of the natural resources involved, nor just because expansive land helped Americans spread out and own their own property, but also because, by taking possession of that territory, we kept a hostile power from possessing it. (We can pause to consider how much more difficult America’s existence would have been, for example, if Napoleon had controlled the Mississippi River, or if the Russians had enjoyed a foothold in North America.)
So now, Greenland is a possible new frontier. The Danes have controlled it for centuries, and frankly, they haven’t done much with it. One reason, of course, is that it’s frigid and, indeed, mostly covered in glacier ice. And yet with the right mindset, inclement weather is only an obstacle, not a roadblock. As plucky Americans have proven in Alaska and elsewhere, we’re perfectly capable of dealing with harsh weather; after all, ice, cold, and isolation are irresistible to hardy vacationers and those who simply wish to really get away from it all.
Moreover, if profit beckons, miners and drillers can always punch their way through. And how much profit is to be had? The truth is, we really don’t know how much natural wealth is to be found in Greenland because nobody has ever seriously looked.
So why haven’t they looked? It’s because the Danes have chosen to treat the territory, for the most part, like a giant nature preserve. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">And that’s why the native population of Greenland mostly lives in relative poverty as poor dependents of the masters in Copenhagen.</span> Yes, it’s an odd kind of neocolonialism there in the North Atlantic as the politically correct Danes pat themselves on the back for their “enlightened eco-consciousness,” even as Greenlanders stay poor.
Yet even from afar, we know that Greenland offers a fantastic development opportunity. And so, if the Danes are too green and politically correct to extract that wealth, perhaps the U.S. can blaze a rich new trail.
Of course, some will say that all this is a pipe-dream, even if the U.S. were to become sovereign in Greenland. That is, the greens in America would work just as hard as the greens in Denmark to stop any such development, preferring to leave Greenland as it is, undeveloped. Yes, American greens, backed up by numerous billion-dollar foundations, would do precisely that: They’d organize, agitate, and litigate to leave Greenland to the seals and polar bears.
So we can see: Green power is not to be underestimated. As a matter of fact, the greens are so powerful in the U.S. that they have, in much of the country, taken the issue of natural resource development off the table. That’s why, for example, efforts to fully exploit America’s hydrocarbon resources have been stymied. As has been pointed out by Breitbart News, the total value of oil and natural gas, under federal lands and waters, <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is $128 trillion</span>. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">That’s a lot of wealth — six times America’s annual GDP, six times our national debt — and yet green power is such that few even talk about tapping into our natural abundance.
</span>So if Greenland were on the agenda, we could at least ask: What’s the value of underground resources in Greenland? And the answer is, simply, nobody knows. And yet we should be confident that the number is, well, yuge.
There’s a good reason — a cosmic reason, one might say — why we should be confident that there are plenty of resources to be found in Greenland. And that’s because valuable elements, and the resulting compounds and minerals, have been scattered all over the earth by the same gargantuan forces that created the universe in the first place. That is, all the naturally occurring elements in the periodic table — from copper to iron, from silver to gold — were created by nucleosynthesis, either as the result of the Big Bang eons ago or by subsequent stellar activity. All that nucleosynthesis has had the effect of hurling gases and matter around the universe until some of it was accreted into celestial bodies, such as our sun and its planets — and including our earth.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">So that’s why raw resources are both so abundant and so widely distributed here on this third rock from the sun; as Charlton Heston might have thundered at his Ten Commandments best, we can behold the mighty hands of God that have whipped treasures all around the globe, including in Greenland.
</span>Now here’s where human mind-power comes into the equation. All through human history, smart and hard-working people have unlocked value from seemingly barren patches of land; that is, they have learned to find, refine, and otherwise gain the riches of the earth. That was the story, for example, of Texas and Oklahoma, a century or more ago: tumbleweeds turned into oil rigs.
Indeed, ever since, the smart and the hard-working have found yet more ways to find additional oil and other hydrocarbons. In doing so, they have the defied most “experts.” You see, back in the early 1970s, savants opined that the world was in the midst of an “energy crisis,” and so we had to cut back on everything and live with less.
Yet in the decades since, in defiance of those brainiacs, we have proven that there was no such natural energy crisis. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The biggest problem was the unnatural imposition of U.S. price controls, finally lifted by President Ronald Reagan <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1981.</span></span> After Reagan de-controlled oil, its production surged. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Indeed, it surged so much that prices actually fell.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">In other words, the free market delivered an unabashed win-win: more production and lower prices.
</span>In the meantime, a whole new group of entrepreneurs and innovators came along, finding new ways to squeeze oil out of old fields; one such was George P. Mitchell (1919-2013), the Texas-born pioneer of fracking. As a result, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1980,</span> proven oil reserves in the U.S. have risen by more than a third, and around the world, reserves have nearly tripled.
So now, looking to the future, there’s every reason to believe that the same sequence would happen in Greenland: new thinking + new production = new wealth.
Of course, the greens would oppose all of this. They would say that they are worried about the puffins, of course, and they would also say they’re worried about climate change. That is, if we extracted and burned more carbon-based fuels, more carbon dioxide would enter into the atmosphere.
Yet seen through the proper prism of informed imagination, Greenland offers great hope for addressing that issue as well. That is, if the concern is that too much carbon dioxide is entering the atmosphere, there’s a simple enough thing to do: capture it. After all, if it was put into the atmosphere, it can be pulled out.
So how, exactly, to pull out the CO2? That can be done in lots of ways, including direct-air capture, as advocated by Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY). And there’s the related, perhaps simpler, idea of planting a lot of trees — call that organic carbon capture.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">As this author has argued here at Breitbart News, carbon capture by any means — industrial or biological — would be a powerful engine of rural economic development.
</span>So now we come back to Greenland. As noted, Greenland is more than a quarter the size of the <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Lower 48.</span> So that gives us plenty of vacant land to work with — to dig, to drill, to otherwise enjoy — and then, at the same time, the land can be used for carbon capture. Yes, it’s mostly ice, and yet useful things can be built on top of ice. And carbon could be the key ingredient.
After all, thanks to its marvelous bonding properties, carbon is the building block of just about everything, and so if we use our brains, we can figure out how to solidify carbon to make new structures — applying, for instance, 3-D printing to the construction of homes, towns, even whole cities. Heck, if we wanted to, we could make a carbon-nanotube space elevator; now that would be the world’s coolest carbon sink.
And if we need energy in Greenland, and we don’t find it in carbon fuels, we would have plenty of other options — if we keep our minds open. For instance, one visionary has suggested creating energy from moving weights around to power generators, and those weights could even be made of ice. (And if the ice melts, carbon capture might help restore the ice.)
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">By this reckoning, Greenland could be just the beginning of a whole new worldwide economic boom.</span> If we can develop that icy island, then there’s the rest of the Arctic, and also the Antarctic. And come to think of it, closer to home, there’s all the un-utilized land in the U.S.; the federal government <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">owns 28 percent</span> of all our territory. We need never touch the Grand Canyon or other precious parks; instead, we can start with <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 61 percent</span> of Alaska that the feds are sitting on.
So let’s give Trump credit for his Greenland idea. Even if nothing comes of it during his presidency, he has expanded the “Overton Window” — that is, the range of acceptable political discourse — reminding us that greatness comes from expansion and innovation, not from contraction and enervation.
One fine day, development will come to Greenland, as well as to other desolate places. Such development can, and should, be done cleanly as well as profitably.
There may never be a Trump Tower in Greenland. But even so, the MAGA spirit could be extended to include the new phrase, MGGA — Make Greenland Great Again.

66690684db06fb05c2766266,23219,"<h3>Assange's Arrest Was Possible Because Ecuador Abandoned Socialism</h3>The shocking news Thursday morning that the government of Ecuador invited British police into its embassy in London to arrest Wikileaks founder Julian Assange left many questioning why the Latin American country, which protected Assange for over half a decade, now felt comfortable letting him go.
The move by President Lenin Moreno – a socialist in name only who has used his tenure in office to liberalize the country after a decade of socialist rule – is the latest salvo in his ongoing campaign to erase the legacy of predecessor Rafael Correa.
Moreno is a member of Correa’s socialist party and became president after the latter threatened to dismantle the entire government if Ecuadorians did not elect his hand-picked successor. Yet he has all but eviscerated the relationship Correa cultivated with Marxist dictators in Venezuela and Cuba, demanded a revision of the country’s ties to communist China, and led a probe into Correa’s tenure that culminated in an arrest warrant for the former head of state.
This week, Moreno cut yet another Correa-era alliance, this time with a controversial antagonist whose only use to Correa was to annoy the U.S. government and help him cover up for authoritarian acts against Ecuadorian journalists.
“Ecuador is a generous country and a nation with open arms. Ours is a government respectful of the principles of international law, and of the institution of the right of asylum,” Moreno stated in a video message distributed on social media explaining the reasoning behind allowing Assange’s arrest. “Granting or withdrawing asylum is a sovereign right of the Ecuadorian state, according to international law.”
Moreno called Assange “disrespectful and aggressive” and accused him of “threatening declarations against Ecuador.” Beyond Assange’s personal behavior, however, Moreno argued that keeping him protected at the embassy violated international law.
“Ecuador’s patience with the behavior of Mr. Assange has reached its limit,” he concluded.

Correa</span></span> was among the first on Twitter to condemn Moreno, writing from exile in Belgium.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">“Lenin Moreno, the nefarious president of Ecuador, has demonstrated his poverty of humanity to the world, handing over Julian Assange – not just a refugee, but also an Ecuadorian citizen – to British police,” Correa wrote.</span> “This risks Assange’s life and humiliates Ecuador. Day of national mourning.”
Correa does not mention that Moreno’s government, not his, extended the courtesy of citizenship to Assange.
Lenín Moreno, nefasto presidente del Ecuador, ha demostrado su miseria humana al mundo, entregando a Julián Assange -no solo asilado, sino también ciudadano ecuatoriano- a la policía británica.
Esto pone en riesgo la vida de Assange, y humilla al Ecuador.
Día de luto mundial.

Correa</span></span> went on to call Moreno “the biggest traitor in Ecuadorian and Latin American history” in a barrage of Twitter posts. At press time, Correa has insulted Moreno on <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Twitter 12 times</span>, not counting retweets of others’ insults.
Reports and rumors that Moreno sought to evict Assange have circulated repeatedly in the past year, reaching a fever pitch when Assange attempted to file a lawsuit against the Ecuadorian government in October for “violating fundamental rights and freedoms” while he stayed at the embassy. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Assange was particularly offended by Ecuador’s demand he pay his internet bill if he wished to use the service, though reports also listed among Ecuador’s requests matters less clearly related to “fundamental rights and freedoms” such as Assange’s refusal to clean up after his cat.</span> The Ecuadorian courts dismissed the suit.
The Ecuadorian government’s issues with Assange aside, his status as a Correa-era bargaining chip proved of little value to Moreno. When Assange took refuge in the embassy <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> socialism was ascendant in South America and then-Ecuadorian President Correa had allied himself with the region’s worst leftist dictators: Cuba’s Fidel Castro and Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez. Correa had just begun emulating the Chávez tactic of shutting down opposition media networks when Assange’s legal situation made state protection – from any state – a must. Correa took the opportunity to lend Assange a hand, claiming to protect the right to a free press and a win against perennial Latin American leftist bogeyman “imperialism” in the process.
“They don’t realize Latin America is free and sovereign. We won’t tolerate interference, colonialism of any kind,” Correa said of the British at the time.
That language, which often featured anti-American tropes, defined the Correa era, as it did that of many leaders in the region at the time: Chávez, Castro regime henchmen, Bolivia’s Evo Morales, Peru’s Ollanta Humala, Argentina’s Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, among others. When right-wing challengers arose to replace many of these leaders later in the decade, many assumed Correa’s socialist movement to be among the few survivors of the continent’s rejection of socialism because of Lenin’s victory. Correa had supported Lenin vocally, at one point telling voters that, should they vote for his conservative rival, Correa would use an obscure procedural rule to dismantle the government and force another election over and over until voters got it “right.”
It took little time for Moreno to use his presidential powers to shift Ecuador rightward. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Under Moreno, Ecuador reversed policies to silence critics in the media and liberalized the economy.</span> It stopped pouring funds into Telesur, a far-left propaganda network largely controlled by Venezuela and Cuba. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">It has begun reevaluating oil deals with China that may have cost the Latin American country millions, presumably in exchange for political support on the global stage.</span> Those deals resulted in Ecuadorian courts first subpoenaing Correa to testify, then ordering his arrest. Moreno’s government has also enacted presidential term limits to block Correa for running for office again.
Most spectacularly, Moreno cut ties to Correa’s closest foreign ally, Venezuela. In an acrimonious declaration in August, Ecuador’s Foreign Ministry cut ties with the Maduro regime, resulting in an exchange of words with the Venezuelan Foreign Minister in which the latter referred to Moreno as a “liar” and a puppet of the United Nations. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Ecuador’s government issued a formal response calling the minister an “embarrassment” and a “poor excuse for a human being,” and his government “sinister.”
Tensions between Moreno and Latin America’s leftists, who once considered him one of their own, will likely continue to worsen as the Venezuelan political crisis continues, bringing the economies of its allies like Cuba down with it.</span> With Assange’s arrest, Moreno has signaled to those powers that he has no intention of returning to their circle.

66690684db06fb05c2766266,49697,"<h3>Skiing Kosovo, Abandoned Lifts and All</h3>The flakes stumbled into the windows, gathered themselves and then wobbled on like revelers caught between pubs. At times it snowed so hard I could hardly see anything out there at all. A wood hut. A concrete wall. When the storm finally broke three days later, <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 40 inches</span> of snow had fallen and everything sprang to life.
The timing was ideal. A few hours earlier, I had arrived in Pristina, the red-roofed capital of Kosovo, just as the first flakes corkscrewed their way to earth. It was February, frigid, and a worsted wool blanket stretched across the Balkan sky. I threw my skis into the back of a 4Runner with two Serbs I had hired to pick me up, and we rode south in silence toward the Sharr Mountains along the Macedonian border. In an hour we’d be at Brezovica, the most delightfully dysfunctional ski resort in Europe.
You’ve probably heard of Kosovo but not of skiing in Kosovo. Landlocked between Albania and Serbia, Kosovo was the last of the nations to congeal in the caldron of old Yugoslavia. For years it remained a largely autonomous province tucked in southwestern Serbia, but a full-blown war for independence erupted there <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1998 between</span> Orthodox Serbs and ethnic Albanians, who are Muslims. The fighting grew so ugly with a Serb-sponsored campaign of ethnic cleansing that NATO eventually intervened on the Albanians’ behalf <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1999.</span> Today, to the United States and <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 110 other</span> countries that recognize it, Kosovo stands as Europe’s newest country, an eight-year-old diamond of roughly two million friendly, westward-looking people still struggling to get on their feet.
But before all of that there was skiing, and Yugoslavia had plenty of it, from Kranjska Gora in the north to Papova Shapka in the south. The sport soared in popularity when the Olympics came to Bosnia <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1984 and</span> a Slovenian, Jure Franko, won silver in the giant slalom to clinch Yugoslavia’s first Winter Olympic medal ever. Brezovica, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 250 miles</span> southeast of Sarajevo, served as a backup for those games, but Yugoslavia’s more hard-bitten skiers already knew the place for offering the steepest slopes and deepest powder for the fewest dinars.
There near the Serbian enclave of Strpce <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 35 miles</span> south of Pristina, storms slam into <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 8,000</span>-foot Sharr Mountains that rocket out of the Metohija basin with abrupt ridges and mighty shoulders cupping some of the continent’s most extensive pasturelands. Back in the ’80s, the resort’s hey-decade,<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10 lifts</span>, including five surface tows, serviced nine named runs, though the real magic happened in the go-anywhere terrain of the open north-facing bowls. D.J.s from Belgrade and Skopje kept the parties going until dawn. In the morning you might awake to find so much snow had fallen that even the wild chamois were stuck.
Brezovica survived the wars but not the peace that followed. Throughout the early 2000s, INEX, the Serbian socially owned enterprise that managed the resort, stopped investing in Brezovica and everything began to crumble. One of the main hotels, a graceless rectangular prism, became a drafty concrete husk. The disco floor went cold. One by one the lifts failed, and <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2013 none</span> of them worked. The storied resort was all but dead.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Then last April, a French consortium signed a contract with Kosovo’s Trade and Industry Ministry to bring Brezovica back to life; the plan was so ambitious that many locals weren’t sure if it was true.</span> A group of some of the world’s biggest leisure resort development firms — MDP Consulting, the engineering firm Egis and the Compagnie des Alpes, the world’s largest ski area management company behind French ski resorts like Val d’Isère, Tignes and Méribel — agreed to invest half a billion dollars, <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 410 million</span> euros, over the <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 17 years</span> to make Brezovica one of the largest, if not the largest, mountain resorts in the Balkans. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">According to Jill Jamieson, a consultant who has worked on the finance package, that is the single largest private investment in the country since the war, if not ever.
</span>The scope of the proposal is mind-boggling. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The consortium has until May to put the financing in order, meaning work could begin this summer.</span> When complete, the resort, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 8,000 acres</span>, will be the size of one and a half Vails, nearly all of which is skiable and inside a national park. It will have the vertical drop of a Crested Butte, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 2,600 feet</span>. The number of hotel beds will grow <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 700 to</span><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,000 </span>— three times as many currently available across the entire country. Visitors will <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 100 miles</span> of slopes, high-speed lifts and three gondola-linked villages. Two international airports, Pristina and Skopje, are no more than a 90-minute drive. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">One day Brezovica might even provide a more budget-friendly alternative to skiing in the Alps.
</span>Skeptics abound, of course. Can the next greatest place to ski in Europe really be in a tiny war-weary country so obscure it’s hard to imagine anyone vacationing there at all? Is a mega-resort the most sustainable way to attract tourists? Will they even find enough snow on a warming planet? Never mind Kosovo’s rampant corruption and politics that are so cantankerous that politicians themselves have lobbed tear gas canisters in their own chambers at least six times in the last few months to disrupt their own proceedings.
And yet there is hope.
“If we can do this, we can do anything,” said Manik Begolli, an Albanian Kosovar who worked on a public-private partnership team contracted by the United States Agency for International Development to help find an investor.
Maybe. For the moment, though, I just hoped I could ski.
Seven-Elevens have bigger parking lots than Brezovica’s but that’s where the Serbs dropped me off just after dark as the storm gathered intensity. Igor Nikolcevic met me there in a camouflage snowboard jacket. He <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 42,</span> a Serb with closely cropped hair and soulful eyes. He grabbed my ski bag and led me up an icy path to a pizzeria that he started with his wife, Draginja, and which he named after his daughter, Tina. Tina now lives in Pristina. I could have her room, fuzzy kitten posters and all.
I followed Igor into the heart of the village, a collection of mostly hand-built cottages run by hangers-on who have eked out a living by offering basic services to the few who make it this far. There was the Cafe Braca and Restaurant Ljuboten. Skis lined the racks in a shop called Dane. The main chairlift out of the village, an ancient double chair, stood eerily quiet, the seats glazed in ice.
“What time will the lifts start running?” I asked.
“You mean, if they start running,” Igor replied.
That was actually an improvement over the last time I was here, <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> when INEX was hundreds of thousands of euros behind on its power bill and the utility company had cut electricity to the lifts. All was not lost. Instead, for €7 — <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $9 at</span> the time — the Dane guys would give you a ride to the top in a snow-grooming machine, where an entire resort’s worth of untracked powder tugged at my tips.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">It was some of the best skiing I’d ever had for less than a nickel a turn: an unlimited supply of deep, creamy snow on a steep, consistent fall line.</span> Others just hiked up a small rise with sleds or sipped brandy outside while music pumped from competing loudspeakers. I loved the vibe and vowed to return.
This time, two years later, there was at least the possibility that the lifts might run. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Sometime <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2014,</span></span> as the French were quietly studying the resort’s prospects, a cadre of groups, including the Kosovo Electricity Corporation, local officials and the minister of trade and industry, hashed out a deal to get two of the chairlifts spinning again.</span> The equipment was still old, maybe even from the 1970s, and too unsafe to operate in a blizzard. I would have to wait for fairer skies to ride them.
Igor pushed open a door and the pizzeria sighed a breath of warm air. Christmas lights hung from the log cabin frame and spilled a molten glow on the snow outside. Snowshoes, wooden skis and photographs of wintry scenes from the resort’s early days decorated the walls. A fire crackled in the wood stove. A pizzeria in Kosovo is one of the coziest places I know.
I took a seat at a long wooden table next to a local with an even longer face. His house two doors down had just succumbed to a chimney fire. With no firefighters to navigate the winding, snowy road up from Strpce in time, the men of the village had rallied to form a bucket brigade and fell a flame-licked tree. That saved the village but the house, a lovely wood and stone cottage, was a loss.
“It went up like paper,” said the owner, Andrej Kavcic. He poured two shots of slivovitz, the plum brandy, and handed me one. “What am I going to do?” he asked. “You pick yourself up and move on. What else.”
Stoicism seems to be a national trait in Kosovo, but there is no mistaking that the country is picking itself up. <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Some 80 percent</span> of the population was displaced during the war. Now new furniture stores sit along new highways lined with new gas stations. The Pristina airport underwent a €180 million expansion <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013 and</span> is now the third-busiest airport in the old Yugoslavia after Belgrade and Zagreb. Problems persist, but the country is making strides to protect its landscape, integrate into Europe and normalize relations with Belgrade, the reason behind parliament’s self-tear-gassing attacks.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The resort’s rebirth comes at a time when Kosovo could really use jobs.</span> Drive around the country and you’ll see smartly dressed people in cafes, in parks, in front of stores, anywhere but at work. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The resort could provide as many <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 3,000 jobs</span>, some temporary, many permanent, in a country where half the population is <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 30 and</span><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 58 percent</span> of the work force is “inactive.”
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">But more than that, travel insiders around the Balkans have long yearned to trade the region’s oily image of strife for that of the crisp fabric of an emerging adventure-travel destination.</span> The efforts appear to be working. <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2014,</span></span><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.7 million</span> international tourists visited Albania, up from <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 645,000 in</span><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2004.</span> And in Montenegro, you can sea kayak through the watercress on Skadar Lake or catch feisty trout in green Macedonian streams, both with guides.
Few Balkan countries beyond Croatia and Greece can entice transoceanic travelers as stand-alone destinations at the moment but, collectively, places like Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania can make for a wildly fascinating itinerary. Kosovo wants in on that action. Brezovica may be its best shot.
“Kosovo is absolutely ready for something like this,” said Pascal Roux, the chief executive of MDP Consulting and leader of the French consortium. “Brezovica could be the pearl of the Balkans.”
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Maybe so, but “it’s just hugely important to be sure it’s done right,” said Christopher Doyle, executive director for Europe of the Adventure Travel Trade Association, which champions sustainable adventure travel markets.</span> What is needed, he said, are “thoughtful supporting efforts to engage the local community and protect the environment.”
Across the Balkans, there is little doubt that skiing is having a moment. Ecosign, a Canadian mountain resort planning firm that has designed Alpine skiing venues for five Winter Olympics, has <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">completed 15 master</span> plans for new or drastically reorganized resorts, including three in Macedonia, four in Serbia and two in Greece. A Dubai-based firm in December announced plans to build <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $5 billion</span> “tourist city” with thousands of holiday homes near Bosnia’s Bjelasnica mountain, where the Olympics were held. Kopaonik, Serbia’s most developed ski resort, added a new six-person heated chairlift last year and a new hotel. Poiana Brasov in Romania recently spent €30 million expanding its terrain, adding snow-making and upgrading lifts.
If anyone stands to lose on the Brezovica deal, it’s Igor. His grandfather, Radojko Nikolcevic, was the ski area’s first general manager after the resort opened <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1954.</span> In the ’70s he built a hut that would become Tina’s pizzeria under Igor <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1993.</span> Today the Nikolcevices earn enough money selling pizzas in winter to last them the rest of the year. Now the consortium will level almost everything — the hotels, the village, the lifts. The Nikolcevices will get <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $250,000 in</span> expropriation fees, but money isn’t the issue.
“We’re happy people want to invest in the resort but never in my life have I been as afraid for my future as I am right now,” Igor said. “The mountains are in me.”
Over the next three days a frustrating pattern emerged. Each morning I awoke to another foot of snow, and each morning the lifts weren’t running. The Dane guys weren’t offering the seven-euro special. Hiking up alone would be misery. Still, I hoped for the best.
I lounged around Tina’s watching the snowflakes hit the windows or took naps under a shaggy blanket in Tina’s old room. The Nikolcevices treated me like family. We sat near the fire talking about life in Kosovo. On the war: “Stupid politicians caused it.” On being Serbs surrounded by Albanians: “We never have an argument.” On why I should not clear the table: “This is Balkans,” Draginja said. “Women do this.”
I helped anyway and then serviced my macho deficits by grabbing a shovel to clear snow off the pizzeria’s roof. The electricity flickered on and off.
“There is something beautiful when everything is broken,” Draginja told me later over a meal of tangy mountain cheese, winter cabbage and a Serbian dish of shredded pork called duvan cvarci. “Everyone comes together.”
On the fourth day, the storm thinned into a delicate fog, and, miracle of miracles, the lifts creaked to life. At last I could ski.
I raced out the door. Classic rock blared from the Che & Fox cafe. Vendors jammed folding tables into the snow to peddle Serbian beer, Austrian juices and Lucky Strikes. A man in the parking lot sat next to a delivery truck with a cardboard sign: ski rentals €5. I clicked into my own skis and scooted up to a double chair called Livada, or “meadow” in Serbian. It rose lazily over an abandoned stone mansion called Stojko’s house, one of the few buildings that will remain. A man stood next to the entrance ready to check my lift ticket. I didn’t have one. I asked where to buy it.
“No, no, you don’t need a ticket,” said a voice in English behind me. I turned to see two men on skis. One of them in a red jacket shuffled forward, said something in Serbian and pressed <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3 worth</span> of coins into the attendant’s palm. “Come, come,” my new friend said, and off we went.
Rexhep Krasniqi,<span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 58,</span> had fled <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Kosovo 23 years</span> ago as a refugee and now worked as a contractor in London. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">He had returned to ski with his younger brother, Isak, who had run a refugee camp in Macedonia before landing a job in finance.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Isak was now unemployed but not worried.</span> “We are good at surviving,” he said.
I spent most of the day skiing with the Krasniqis, who explained the ticket system. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">A price list said I could buy anything from a single ride <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 10 days</span> of unlimited rides, but almost no one consulted it.</span> Instead they negotiated rates with the attendant. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">A single ride cost <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3.25,</span> though Rexhep had bargained to get both of us at least two rides for that.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">As best as I could tell a day pass cost <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $11.</span>
Now, new for this winter, workers have installed an electronic ticket-reader and day passes have jumped to <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $21,</span> a fortune when the average worker earns <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $380 a</span> month.</span> “No more corruption,” a local told me later, “but less skiers.”
We picked our way through a steep notch called the Lion’s Gate and found untracked lines through the trees. Wind-powered snow roared off the ridge behind us in great white flames. The snow hissed violently off the bottoms of my skis to form blue contrails. Most of the terrain was intermediate to expert-only. The revamped resort will have more beginner runs.
Eventually we stopped for lunch on a patio at a slopeside hut called Cafe Collmar, where a waiter brought us coffee, brandy and cheesy bread. Rexhep refused to let me pay <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $5 bill</span>. “No Albanian in Kosovo will ever let you pay,” he said, politely but firmly. “You are American, and to us Americans are like Jesuses.”
My last day dawned a piercing blue and the air shimmered with suspended snow crystals. This time Igor and a friend from Belgrade, Marko Nikolic, showed me a wild backcountry run that dropped through miles of open powder into a tight stream bed. Marko, a mountain guide, then invited me to climb to a high point in the resort,<span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,274</span>-foot Pribreg mountain, where we could find the longest, most challenging runs back to the base.
We rode Livada up as high as it went, then I slung my skis over my shoulder and kicked steps up the sastrugi beyond the top station. We gained an easy ridge and made the summit <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 45 minutes</span>. A lift once came all the way up here but it hadn’t worked in years, and the top wheelhouse was completely entombed in tons of feathered ice. The slope below was so steep it gave me vertigo.
Soon all of this would be very different. I tried to picture a brand-new lift stitched into the rock, the sprawling village where Tina’s once stood, and the legs I’d need to ski all those new runs. I had one foot in Macedonia, the other in Kosovo, and five more countries in view.
It may have been selfish, but Brezovica felt perfect as is. We have so many polished resorts already but so few that can foster skiing at its most authentic without any flash. Even more selfish: What do you do when you know one of your favorite places to visit, a secret, is about to blow up? Don’t you long for it to stay the way it is?
Brezovica has to change, of course. As anyone in Kosovo knows, stop moving for long enough and someone will come bury you.
Marko wasted no time. He strapped on his snowboard. I lowered my goggles. Then we both pushed off and floated through a beautiful, broken world.
IF YOU GO
Getting There
Pristina (PRN) and Skopje (SKP) are the closest airports to Brezovica. There are no direct flights to either city from the United States. Check fares on Turkish Airlines, Swiss, Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, SAS, EasyJet, Delta, Alitalia and Norwegian for connecting in Europe.
What You Should Know
This winter will likely be the last to see Brezovica in all of its rundown glory. In its current state, the resort is not for everyone. The lifts may not run every day. There is no such thing as customer service. It’s unclear what facilities will be open next winter. For updates check the Sar Planina-Brezovica Facebook page or the Brezovica Resort Facebook page. The ski area also has a website but it isn’t very helpful: brezovica-ski.com.
Guides
Hiring a guide to help you find a place to stay and arrange airport transfers is a must at the moment. Igor Nikolcevic is neither a guide nor an outfitter but he speaks very good English and can help arrange transfers, especially from Pristina, lift tickets, guides and lodging. Message him through the Pizzeria Tina Facebook page. Outdoor Albania, an outfitter based in Tirana, also runs custom trips to Brezovica. (OutdoorAlbania.com; info@outdooralbania.com).
Transfers and Lift Tickets
Expect to pay <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 50 euros</span> each way for transfers from Pristina. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Lift tickets now cost €20 a day.</span>",,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,4,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,

DealBook Briefing: Does Facebook Have Room for More Than One Founder?
Good Thursday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)
Founders may think twice about selling to Facebook
Selling your start-up to Facebook will make you rich, but it might not make you happy. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, who sold Instagram to the social networking giant for <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $715 million</span>, resigned earlier this week, reportedly over tensions with Mark Zuckerberg about growth.
Brian Acton, one of the co-founders who sold WhatsApp to Facebook <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $22 billion</span>, went further. In a dishy interview with Forbes, he spoke of similar tensions with Mr. Zuckerberg. (Facebook wanted ads; he didn’t.)
“They are businesspeople, they are good businesspeople,” Mr. Acton said. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">“They just represent a set of business practices, principles and ethics, and policies that I don’t necessarily agree with.”
</span>A senior Facebook executive, David Marcus, pushed back against Mr. Acton, writing in a post that “attacking the people and company that made you a billionaire” is “a whole new standard of low-class.”
Yes, founders take their money and make a choice. But Facebook’s acquisition strategy appears to be stuttering, and its newer products may head in unexpected directions with their founders out of the picture. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">That’s a problem: Facebook’s acquisitions have been oases of calm and growth compared to its main business.
</span>SoftBank’s founder has the biggest dreams in tech
Masa Son has raised <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $100 billion</span> for his company’s Vision Fund to invest in tech companies, on what he says is a 300-year strategy. But in a Bloomberg Businessweek profile, he says that’s only the start: He wants to raise <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another $100 billion</span> every two or three years, and expand the Vision Fund’s team of deal makers <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 300.</span> Counting him, it’s currently ten.
That’s an incredible amount of money, and competing investment firms are (understandably) frightened. It’s very different at start-ups, Businessweek points out:
SoftBank has given them the equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet of foreign investment dollars. “You think they can’t eat any more,” says Jules Maltz, a partner with IVP, a Sand Hill Road firm. The entrepreneurs “cram it in, put it in their pockets, take doggy bags, whatever.”
The bigger worry might be to SoftBank’s investors: The Vision Fund will need a lot of home-run investments to cover bets that huge.
Silicon Valley tells lawmakers to go easy on regulation
Executives from Google, Apple, AT&T and more appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee yesterday to answer privacy questions. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“We have arrived at a moment where, I believe, there is a strong desire by both Republicans and Democrats, and by both industry and public interest groups, to work in good faith to reach a consensus on a national consumer data privacy law,” Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the committee’s chairman, said in an opening statement.
</span>But a clear message emerged from the tech giants: Don’t go too far.
• Amazon’s associate general counsel, Andrew DeVore, asked lawmakers to “ensure that additional overhead and administration demands any legislation might require actually produce commensurate privacy benefits.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">• Keith Enright, Google’s new chief privacy officer, told them to “take into consideration the impacts on service functionality, the consumer benefits of free and low-cost products, the future of the open web and app ecosystem.”
</span>Nothing will happen quickly. “I think we might have a pretty good idea what a draft would look like,” Mr. Thune concluded. “But I suspect we probably wouldn’t get it acted on until next year.”

</span>Fox admits defeat over Sky
Twenty-First Century Fox agreed yesterday to sell <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 39 percent</span> stake in the British broadcaster to Comcast <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $15 billion</span>. It’s the end of a monthslong battle, and of a yearslong quest by Rupert Murdoch to regain control of a company he created decades ago.
Fox is selling at the behest of Walt Disney, which struck a deal over the summer to buy most of Mr. Murdoch’s media empire.
Elizabeth Winkler of Heard on the Street says it’<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $15 billion</span> for Disney to spend on its fight with Netflix. But for Comcast shareholders, it’s <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another $15 billion</span> spent on an asset that many didn’t want in the first place.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Fed stands up to Trump
It raised interest rates as expected yesterday, to <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2 and</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.25 percent</span>, citing a “particularly bright moment” for the U.S. economy.</span> President Trump said he was “not happy.”
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">So he shows no sign of returning to the tradition of presidential silence on fiscal policy.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But the Fed still plans another increase before the end of the year, and some of its officials reckon avoiding inflation will require raising rates to the point of restricting the economy.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">For his part, Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chief, said yesterday: “We don’t consider political factors.”
</span>For Nike, Kaepernick is an existential choice
The sportswear company’s decision to feature Colin Kaepernick in its latest ads has been celebrated as shrewd marketing. But Nike nearly dropped the former N.F.L. quarterback after he became the face of player protests.
Then its communications chief, Nigel Powell, intervened, report Julie Creswell, Kevin Draper and Sapna Maheshwari in the NYT:
Powell argued that Nike would face backlash from the media and consumers if it was seen as siding with the N.F.L. rather than Kaepernick. And Nike, along with most apparel companies, is desperate to attract urban youth who increasingly look up to Kaepernick; the largely white, older N.F.L. fans angry at the league over the protests are not a priority for those companies, analysts say.
Another factor: Under Nike’s latest deal with the N.F.L., it can’t sell league-branded merchandise <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 2020.</span> That helped it choose to put Mr. Kaepernick front and center. So far, the wager is paying off.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The stock market may face a new threat: increasingly attractive returns on government bonds.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">More from Peter Eavis of DealBook:
Buying a 10-year Treasury today would provide its holders <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 3 percent</span> a year for a decade with virtually no risk of losing any money in the process.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Such a return might seem particularly attractive to investors who believe the stock market is expensive and is vulnerable to a sell-off.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">And:
If companies’ profits continue to grow strongly, the earnings yield will rise and stocks will look more attractive compared with government bonds.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">But corporate earnings growth is expected to slow next year.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">And the trade war may cause corporate profits to moderate even more.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">In that case, the difference between the 10-year yield and the earnings yield would shrink even more.</span> Investors may be more tempted then to shed stocks and put more money into bonds.

I believed in traditional reporting, but Trump changed me — and it should change the rest of the media too.
Perspective by Margaret Sullivan
<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 12,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2022 at</span> 10:00 a.m. EDT
Despite my nearly four decades in journalism, I was unprepared for the moment of no return that came on a July day <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span></span> as a blazing sun beat down on the streets of Cleveland. Walking around the grounds of the Republican National Convention, I was looking for a column idea. I was new at this, having started at The Washington Post only a few weeks earlier. Wandering and observing, I came upon a table of souvenirs, meant to appeal to the convention attendees who had arrived from all corners of the nation to cheer on the Republican Party’s nomination of Donald Trump. I already had seen some gleefully misogynistic anti-Clinton paraphernalia — “Hillary sucks but not like Monica” — but nothing measured up to the horror I felt as I registered the meaning of a T-shirt featuring the image of a noose and these words: “Rope. Tree. Journalist. Some assembly required.”
Over the weeks and months ahead, as I started to write what I hoped were well-reasoned Post columns about Trump’s relationship with the media, I felt an irrational anger coming at me like an unending blast from an industrial-strength hose. Trump hadn’t invented this anger, of course, but he certainly emboldened it — and used it for his own purposes. On social media, in phone messages, in emails I received, the sheer hatred from Trump supporters shocked and even frightened me. One, unsigned but from a “lifetime member of the NRA,” asserted that people like me wouldn’t be around much longer. Another, signed “A Real, True Patriot,” read:
“Though I would never read a manure-laden pile of toilet paper like Washington Compost, I heard about your Nazi column about ‘reaching the masses’ with your fake news to convince people that your leftist Nazi lies are truth. You are a well-trained serpent of the left, following communist orders as you were taught. ‘If you say and repeat a lie often enough, it will eventually be seen as truth’ — Lenin … Here’s what you (slithering, fake-news/propaganda- generating slimy slug) should do: Go fornicate yourself with a large, sharp knife, and then eat rat poison until your belly is stuffed.”
I was called the c-word repeatedly. One reader suggested I have my breasts cut off. I tried to let all this nastiness roll off my back and even found it amusing when a Post reader sent me an email calling me a “venomous serpent.” John Schwartz, then a reporter for the New York Times who had become a friend, suggested I treat it as a badge of honor and write a book titled “Memories of a Venomous Serpent.”
Now, six years later, we journalists know a lot more about covering Trump and his supporters. We’ve come a long way, but certainly made plenty of mistakes. Too many times, we acted as his stenographers or megaphones. Too often, we failed to refer to his many falsehoods as lies. It took too long to stop believing that, whenever he calmed down for a moment, he was becoming “presidential.” And it took too long to moderate our instinct to give equal weight to both sides, even when one side was using misinformation for political gain.
It’s been an education for all of us — a gradual realization that the instincts and conventions of traditional journalism weren’t good enough for this moment in our country’s history. As Trump prepares to run again <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2024,</span> it’s worth reminding ourselves of the lessons we’ve learned — and committing to the principle that, when covering politicians who are essentially running against democracy, old-style journalism will no longer suffice.
Back <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span></span> I was still looking for common ground with the Trump crowd. It fit with my background as a traditional newspaper journalist. During <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 13 years</span> as chief editor of the Buffalo News, ending <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> I had believed that I could listen to or communicate with our readers, whatever their politics — and I was registered to vote as a “blank.” Our editorial board, which I sat on, endorsed candidates from various parties, and I had courteous relationships with officeholders of all stripes. I frequently would go out to speak to civic organizations, such as rotary clubs, in the Buffalo-Niagara region with no regard for whether their members leaned right or left.
At the Cleveland airport after the convention, I interviewed one delegate, a concierge for a car dealership named Mary Sue McCarty, who wore a cowboy hat and pearls as she waited for her flight home to Dallas. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">She had her mind made up about the news media: “Journalists aren’t doing their jobs.</span> They are protecting a certain class.” <span id=""1"" class=""red"">When I pointed out that it was the New York Times that broke the consequential story about Hillary Clinton’s email practices and that mainstream media organizations had aggressively investigated the finances of the Clinton Foundation, she shrugged: “If it’s a Republican, it’s investigated to death.</span> If it’s a Democrat, it’s breezed over.”
This assertion could hardly have been more wrong. After all, the media’s endless emphasis on Clinton’s emails would prove to be a big factor in dooming her campaign. It simply wasn’t the case that the press was giving Democrats a pass.
Clearly, the empirical common ground I depended upon — and believed in — was eroding. Dealing with that growing reality over the next few years would change me as a journalist and even as a person. Some principles and beliefs, I found, were more important than appearing to get along with everyone or responding to criticism by offering to compromise or change course. Journalists have to stand, unwaveringly, for the truth — and if that meant being attacked by zealots who wanted to call such a position evidence of bias, I could live with that. For me, it would soon become a matter of simple integrity to acknowledge that some of the old-school rules and practices didn’t work anymore.

From this new vantage point, it seemed self-evident that the mainstream press was too often going easy on Trump. Well into his presidency, journalists didn’t want to use the word “lie” for Trump’s constant barrage of falsehoods. To lie, editors reasoned, means to intend to be untruthful. Since journalists couldn’t be inside politicians’ heads, how were we supposed to know if — by this definition — they were really lying? The logic eventually became strained, given that Trump blithely repeated the same rank mistruths over and over.
Too many reporters and their editors didn’t seem to want to figure out how to cover Trump properly. From the moment he descended the golden escalator at Manhattan’s Trump Tower in <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2015 to</span> announce his candidacy, the news media was in his thrall. Journalists couldn’t stop writing about him, showing him on TV and even broadcasting images of the empty stage waiting for him to arrive at a rally. Trump had described himself as “the ratings machine,” and for once he wasn’t exaggerating.
As I continued to tackle <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 campaign</span>, I criticized the press’s obsession with the former reality-TV star, yet I was caught up in it, too. I have no regrets about what I wrote, but I certainly was aware that if I wrote a column with Trump’s name in the headline, it probably would find a passionate audience: thousands of comments and retweets, hundreds of emails, requests to talk on TV. And because I wrote about the news media, and Trump never stopped using the news media as a foil, there was so much to say.
In every way, Trump was a deeply abnormal candidate, but the news media couldn’t seem to communicate that effectively or even grasp the problem. Instead, his every unhinged, middle-of-the-night tweet was covered like legitimate news. To be fair, the media was applying a standard that had made sense up until that moment: When a major presidential candidate says something provocative or worse, it’s newsworthy. The problem is that we were applying this old standard to a candidate who was exploiting it for his own purposes — while seeking to undermine democracy itself.

In the late afternoon of Nov.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> Election Day, I walked into The Post’s newsroom with a column already started about Hillary Clinton’s supposedly inevitable victory. A few hours later, I was scrambling, just like every reporter, editor and commentator. My colleagues and I watched the television screens placed all around the newsroom as one battleground state after another fell to Trump.
Tossing away my useless column, I wrote that the media coverage of <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 race</span> had been, as I put it, “an epic fail.” <span id=""2"" class=""red"">They — and I would include myself in this criticism — employed a kind of magical thinking: A Trump presidency shouldn’t happen, therefore it won’t happen.
</span>Soon, word filtered down from the boss, Marty Baron, that I should produce a second column before I left the newsroom that night. He wanted me to write my recommendations for how the traditional press should cover the new president. So, I wrote a call to arms for American journalists: “Journalists are going to have to be better — stronger, more courageous, stiffer-spined — than they’ve ever been.” I filed it, not at all convinced that I’d written anything worthwhile on this momentous night, said good night to my editor and headed out of the newsroom <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 3 a</span>.m.
Stunned and spent, I walked slowly through the deserted streets of downtown Washington. As I neared my apartment, I could see the U.S. Capitol, that seemingly inviolable symbol of American democracy, off to the east. Lit from within, it glowed an ethereal white in the darkness.
In every way, Trump was a deeply abnormal candidate, but the news media couldn’t seem to communicate that effectively or even grasp the problem.
As we would learn over the coming years, the Capitol was not inviolable, and neither is the democracy it represents. American democracy is now on the edge of a precipice. What can members of the press do to help keep it from tipping over as <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2024 campaign</span> looms? What should we have learned since that summer in 2016?
For one thing, I’m convinced that journalists — specifically those who cover politics — must keep a sharp focus on truth-seeking, not old-style performative neutrality. Does that mean we throw objectivity out the window? Of course not. We should be resolutely objective in the sense of seeking evidence and approaching subjects with an open mind. We should not, however, resort to taking everything down the middle, no matter what. Rather than, for example, having equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats (or conservatives and progressives) on every talk show, or devoting equal numbers of words to each side of a political argument, we should be thinking about what coverage serves the public best.
Those who deny the outcome of <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span></span> certainly don’t deserve a media megaphone for that enduring lie, one that is likely to reemerge in the presidential campaign ahead. But the media should go one step further: When covering such a politician in other contexts — for example, about abortion rights or gun control — journalists should remind audiences that this public figure is an election denier.
That’s exactly the model pursued by WITF, a public radio station in Harrisburg, Pa., which decided to remind its audience on a regular basis that some Republican state legislators and members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation had opposed the transfer of power to Joe Biden, despite the lack of evidence to support their claims of election fraud. A story on the station’s website about a state legislator’s efforts to get Pennsylvanians vaccinated was accompanied by a sidebar of text about his behavior after the election. On-air stories have used a tagline to accomplish the same purpose. The decision wasn’t easy, one editor told me, “because this is not the normal thing.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Advertisement
Unfortunately, many media organizations — increasingly owned these days by huge corporations or hedge funds — seem more interested in ratings and profits than in serving the public interest.</span> So, they are extremely hesitant to offend groups of viewers or voters, including the many Republicans who have signed on to the lie about <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span></span> being stolen. The new boss of CNN, Chris Licht, raised eyebrows when he made the rounds on Capitol Hill a few months ago to assure Republican leaders that members of their party would be treated fairly on the network that had been one of the former president’s favorite punching bags. One conservative publication, the Washington Free Beacon, called Licht’s unusual outreach an “apology tour.” Given all this, it’s difficult to picture CNN consistently alerting viewers that a politician is an election denier, even when discussing a different subject. Yet that’s exactly the type of bold measure that is needed.
Media people — not just reporters but their editors and top leaders of newsrooms — also need to take a hard, critical look at the types of stories that constitute traditional campaign coverage. That coverage has historically leaned on such things as live footage of speeches, rallies and debates; on “horse race” articles based on polls or conventional wisdom; and on blowing up small conflicts (campaign staff in disarray!) into major stories. These modes of coverage can have the effect of normalizing a candidate who should not be normalized. They also often constitute a distraction at a time when huge swaths of one party are essentially running against democratic practices.
By no means am I counseling that journalists act as if they are “on the team” of Trump’s rivals. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">That’s not our job.</span> At the same time, we have to be aware that covering someone who doesn’t care about democratic norms — even something as basic as the peaceful transfer of power — requires different judgments about what stories really matter, and how we should or should not cover them.
In making these judgments, we have to relentlessly explain ourselves to our readers, viewers and listeners. Although it didn’t involve Trump, a good example of this came over the summer when the Plain Dealer newspaper in Cleveland decided against covering a rally for U.S. Senate candidate J.D. Vance featuring Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis because of the absurdly restrictive rules the campaign had tried to impose, including a prohibition against interviewing attendees who weren’t approved by rally organizers. Instead, the Plain Dealer published white space, with a note to readers written by editor Chris Quinn headlined, “We reject the free speech-trampling rules set by J.D. Vance and Ron DeSantis for covering their rally.” Quinn was blunt: “Think about what they were doing here. They were staging an event to rally people to vote for Vance while instituting the kinds of policies you’d see in a fascist regime.”
Of course, the press must be just as tough on Democrats, should they adopt similar tactics or start lying all the time or trashing governmental norms. The standards should be the same for all. But journalists shouldn’t shy away from the unavoidable truth: Most of this is coming from Trump-style Republicans.
Perhaps the most important thing journalists can do as they cover the campaign ahead is to provide thoughtful framing and context. They shouldn’t just repeat what’s being said, but help explain what it means. This is especially important in headlines and news alerts, which are about as far as many news consumers get. When Trump rants about the supposed horrors of rigged elections and voting fraud, journalists have to constantly provide the counterweight of truth. We have gotten better at this <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2016.</span> Now we have to stick to it.
All of these suggestions go against the grain of traditional politics coverage. Undoubtedly, this approach will draw accusations of bias from the right; undoubtedly, journalists and news leaders will be put on the defensive. They’ll need to get over that. The stakes are enormously high. Doing things the same old way isn’t remotely appropriate. By now, that’s something we all should have learned.

Sitting before a parliamentary oversight committee last month, two top executives from Tanzania Petroleum Development Corp. declined to reveal details of billions of dollars in gas contracts that the state company had signed with foreign investors. Parliamentarians had a sharp riposte: They called the police.

The two company board members had argued they needed permission from their investors before they disclosed details of the deal. But soon after a police officer showed up, the executives were fumbling with their paperwork, according to lawmakers who attended the hearing—but in the end, they didn’t release any documents.

The executives were escorted out of the parliamentary building and into a police truck. They were briefly taken into custody, detained for a few hours and released without charges.

“Companies must accept the era of secrecy is over,” says Zitto Kabwe, the head of the Tanzanian parliament’s public-accounts committee, who witnessed the scene.

TPDC declined to comment on the police detention of its executives, and Tanzania’s ministry of energy and minerals didn’t respond to requests for comment.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Battles over contract transparency are brewing across Africa, touching on sensitive tax issues among energy and mineral giants trying to tap into a new frontier of the global economy.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The clashes show how once-malleable African governments are fighting for a bigger share of earnings in sometimes-secretive deals, often following the advice of Western groups such as the Soros Foundation and the African Governance Initiative, which is headed by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

</span>The upshot: A raft of legal disputes that have stalled production of some key projects and frayed relationships between African governments and foreign investors.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Uganda remains embroiled in a litany of tax disputes with Tullow Oil PLC and Heritage Oil Corp., nearly a decade after oil reserves were discovered.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The country had amended its income-tax law to introduce a capital-gains tax on the sale of oil rights shortly after the discoveries, prompting Heritage and Tullow to contest the new tax assessments.

</span>Zambia’s mining industry is faltering after the government in October decided to more than triple mine royalties <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 20%,</span> following the advice of Western groups. This compelled miners such as First Quantum Minerals Ltd. and Glencore PLC to <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">suspend $2 billion</span> in expansion projects.

And in Guinea, disputes stemming from government changes to a lease for the Simandou iron-ore mine are dogging the project.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Some experts argue the disputes reveal a blurring between demands for more disclosure from investors and more tax revenue from governments.</span> “It’s about negotiating to get a better deal in terms of money ... <span id=""9"" class=""red"">income, but not necessarily transparency,” says Carlos Lopes, the chief of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.

</span>African governments have found ready partners for both endeavors. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Western organizations such as the Soros Foundation, founded by hedge-fund billionaire George Soros, and international institutions like the United Nations and the World Bank are providing advisory services to resource-rich nations on how to adjust ownership structures and rejigger tax laws for a bigger slice of revenues.

</span>Some analysts say this is a necessary tilting of the scales toward African governments.

“The deals often favor the companies which have access to vast experience and capital, while the governments do not have the experience, institutions or laws in place to manage their natural resources,” says George Boden, an analyst with U.K.-based anticorruption group Global Witness.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The African Governance Initiative—headed by Mr. Blair—has helped Rwanda become the region’s first country to issue mining certificates at the point of export, in an effort to keep conflict minerals out of the supply chain.

</span>In Guinea, Mr. Soros, through his foundations, played a key role in advising the government on its review of mining deals struck by previous governments. This led to the ouster of BSG Resources, the mining arm of Israeli tycoon Beny Steinmetz’s family-owned conglomerate, from the country earlier this year and the ushering in of Rio Tinto PLC.

Mr. Steinmetz has since sued Global Witness—partly funded by the Soros Foundation—which accused his company of obtaining mining rights in the country through corruption. BSG also is in international arbitration with Guinea in a bid to win compensation for being stripped of the Simandou mine. BSG Resources has denied wrongdoing and accused President Alpha Condé’s government of seeking to expropriate its rights by stealth—a claim the government rejects.

Simandou’s current operator Rio Tinto has also sued rival Vale SA and Mr. Steinmetz, alleging that they colluded to rob the Anglo-Australian company of the highly prized iron-ore concession, further complicating the legal battles around the mine. Both parties denied Rio Tinto’s allegations, which a BSG Resources spokesman called “baseless and bizarre.”

In Tanzania, the recent police detention of the oil-company executives capped months of a simmering row at the local parliament over whether the East African nation is getting a fair deal for its newfound vast natural-gas resources.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mr. Kabwe’s fight to make all contracts public kicked off in August, when part of the contract with Norway’s Statoil ASA and ExxonMobil Corp. was leaked to the local press, showing that the state-run Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation, or TPDC, had agreed to terms yielding 30%-50% of the revenue for state coffers—well below the 50%-80% yields recommended by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

</span>Tanzania <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009 signed</span> the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, an effort led by non-governmental organizations to bring contracts to light. Though most of Africa’s other mineral-rich nations also are signatories, implementation has been uneven.

Mr. Kabwe, who heads the parliament’s public-accounts committee, ordered TPDC to bring all contracts to parliament for scrutiny, but the state-run company cited investor reluctance to publicize the terms. It didn’t comply with a Nov.<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 deadline</span>—at which point the two senior TPDC board members were briefly taken into custody.

An official with TPDC said that confidentiality clauses in the deals prevent the state company from revealing them to third parties.

ExxonMobil, the minority partner in the venture, referred questions to Statoil. Knut Rostad, a spokesman for Statoil, said the deal was “balanced and comparable to commercial terms in other places with similar risks.” He added that his company was making a long-term commitment to the country and has already spent <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $1.5 billion</span> on exploration.

But Mr. Rostad said he wouldn’t comment on parliamentary debates or police detention of TPDC executives. He confirmed his company didn’t release the contracts but declined to answer why, given the demands of the Tanzanian parliament.

66861d24a5f104da3398a8ea,30538,"<h3>The Website That Shows How a Free Press Can Die</h3>BUDAPEST — Hungary’s leading news website, Origo, had a juicy scoop: A top aide to the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, had used state money to pay for sizable but unexplained expenses during secret foreign trips. The story embarrassed Mr. Orban and was a reminder that his country still had an independent press.
But that was <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span> Today, Origo is one of the prime minister’s most dutiful media boosters, parroting his attacks on migrants and on George Soros, the Hungarian-American philanthropist demonized by the far right on both sides of the Atlantic.
And if Origo once dug into Mr. Orban’s government, it now pounces on his political opponents.
“Let’s look at the affairs of Laszlo Botka!” a headline blared earlier this month in a salacious take on the only mayor of a major Hungarian city not aligned with Mr. Orban’s party, Fidesz. “Serious scandals, mysteries surround the socialist mayor of Szeged.”
If little known outside Hungary, Origo is now a cautionary tale for an age in which democratic norms and freedom of expression are being challenged globally — and President Trump and other leaders have intensified attacks on the free press.
In many ways, Hungary has foreshadowed the democratic backsliding now evident in different corners of the world. Since winning power <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span></span></span> Mr. Orban has steadily eroded institutional checks and balances, especially the independent media. His government now oversees state-owned news outlets, while his allies control most of the country’s private media sources, creating a virtual echo chamber for Mr. Orban’s far right, anti-immigrant views.
The story of Origo’s transformation from independent news source to government cheerleader offers a blueprint of how Mr. Orban and his allies pulled this off. Rather than a sudden and blatant power grab, the effort was subtle but determined, using a quiet pressure campaign.
Origo’s editors were never imprisoned and its reporters were never beaten up. But in secret meetings — including a pivotal one in Vienna — the website’s original owner, a German-owned telecommunications company, relented. The company, Magyar Telekom, first tried self-censorship. Then it sought a nonpartisan buyer.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">But, ultimately, Origo went to the family of Mr. Orban’s former finance minister.
</span>“When Orban came to power <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span></span></span> his aim was to eliminate the media’s role as a check on government,” said Attila Mong, a former public radio anchor and a critic of Mr. Orban. “Orban wanted to introduce a regime which keeps the facade of democratic institutions but is not operated in a democratic manner — and a free press doesn’t fit into that picture.”
On the surface, Hungary’s democratic institutions seem to be operating normally. The judiciary is nominally independent. Elections are held. Newsstands are stacked with dozens of private publications.
“We would never sink so low,” Mr. Orban said in a September speech, “as to silence those with whom we disagree.”
But below the surface, the system has been degraded. The Constitutional Court is stacked with judges appointed by Fidesz. The judiciary and the prosecution service are headed by two of Mr. Orban’s oldest supporters. Both the electoral system and the electoral map have been altered to favor Mr. Orban’s party.
Other than a handful of mainly online outlets, the Hungarian media has been either silent about or supportive of these moves.
According to Freedom House’s press freedom index, Hungary’s media was judged the 87th freest in the world <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span></span> down from joint 40th <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span></span></span> when Mr. Orban entered office.
The index now labels Hungarian media as only “partly free,” while Hungary’s wider political system, once classified as a “consolidated democracy,” has been downgraded to “semi-consolidated democracy.”
And the fate of Origo, Mr. Mong said, is “very symbolic” of that transition.
A Secret Meeting
<span id=""1"" class=""red""><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span></span> Origo was Hungary’s most-read news website, renowned for its hard-nosed investigations into the likes of Lajos Simicska, a friend of Mr. Orban who had long financed his party.
</span>By then, Mr. Orban’s appointees controlled the state media, as well as Hungary’s two main media regulators. He had given regulators more power to fine and punish independent news outlets, or to drive them off air, yet Origo did not seem cowed.
The site had been created in the late 1990s by Magyar Telekom, the country’s leading telecoms company, to lure subscribers to its fledgling internet service. Over time, though, Origo evolved into a journalistic force with its own identity.
But as Origo thrived, its parent company faced challenges.
Since the start of the cellphone era, Magyar Telekom had been Hungary’s leading telecommunications company. When Deutsche Telekom, the German telecoms giant which also owns T-Mobile, bought a majority stake in the company <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2005,</span> Magyar Telekom was considered a marquee purchase.
But things changed with Mr. Orban’s election <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">He levied an “emergency” tax on the telecoms sector, in a bid to reduce government debt after the global financial crisis.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The tax was also seen as part of a wider backlash against foreign firms that had bought up large sections of the Hungarian economy after the fall of communism.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">For Magyar Telekom, it meant an <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $100 million</span> tax bill.</span> Company executives feared more bad news <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span></span> when Mr. Orban’s government was due to renew its frequency licenses. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Ahead of a September deadline, negotiations would determine how much of the market would be assigned to Telekom, and at what price.
</span>The talks were not going well. Months before the deadline, René Obermann, Deutsche Telekom’s C.E.O., became embroiled in a shouting match with Mr. Orban at a private meeting in Germany, two people briefed on the exchange said.
Throughout the year, Magyar Telekom executives met with Janos Lazar, Mr. Orban’s second-in-command, to negotiate the license renewal and a multimillion-dollar contract to install broadband internet throughout rural Hungary. Initially, Origo was not a topic of discussion.
But that changed in the early summer at a secret meeting in Vienna between Mr. Lazar and two senior company executives, according to three people with knowledge of the discussion. Mr. Lazar said that Origo’s journalists had historically struggled to grasp the government’s perspective on certain matters and proposed a remedy: a secret line of communication between Origo’s editors and the highest levels of government.
Mr. Lazar was careful not to frame the request as a quid pro quo for new licenses, or as a form of censorship. But the Magyar Telekom executives took it seriously.
By autumn, Origo had signed a contract with a media consultancy run by Attila Varhegyi, the former director of Mr. Orban’s party. As a consultant, Mr. Varhegyi had played a major role in turning Hungarian state media into a mouthpiece for Mr. Orban and now his attention had pivoted to the private sector.
Under the deal, Mr. Varhegyi’s firm could call Origo’s editor with suggestions about coverage.
That same month, the government extended its license agreements with the country’s three mobile telephone operators.
Magyar Telekom was awarded the biggest share.
Both Magyar Telekom and its parent company declined to comment on the Vienna meeting and Mr. Varhegyi. But in a general statement, Magyar Telekom said: “Dialogue between the government in office and the management of Magyar Telekom is a matter of fact, but its aim has never been to limit publicity or the freedom of press.”
Mr. Varhegyi and Mr. Lazar turned down several interview requests and ignored requests for comment.
An Editor Fired
Outraged, Origo’s editor in chief resigned, refusing to participate in the deal. But his replacement, Gergo Saling, appeared undaunted.
By <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2014,</span> Mr. Saling’s team had even launched an investigation into Mr. Lazar’s foreign travel expenses. Requests by Mr. Varhegyi’s firm to slow the project down were ignored.
But Mr. Saling was living on borrowed time.
The investigation was embarrassing to Magyar Telekom: Mr. Lazar had overseen the company’s license renewal and discussions were still underway over the contract to install broadband in the countryside.
Mr. Lazar complained about the story in a meeting with two Magyar Telekom executives in <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2014,</span> according to two people with knowledge of the discussion, and his disapproval was quickly relayed to Origo’s management. It was one of several attempts by Magyar Telekom management, and Mr. Varhegyi’s firm, to sway the investigation, both before and after the broadband deal was announced later that month, according to four people familiar with the controversy.
Undeterred, Mr. Saling’s journalists continued to scrutinize Mr. Lazar’s travel. They eventually began court proceedings to request specific travel records, and published several embarrassing stories about the minister’s movements.
But by the start of summer, Mr. Saling’s superiors had run out of patience. Mr. Orban had won re-election in April. Mr. Saling was fired in early June, nominally by mutual agreement.
The decision was ultimately made by Miklos Vaszily, Origo’s chief executive. But it came only after months of pressure on Mr. Vaszily from Magyar Telekom’s management and Mr. Varhegyi’s firm, according to three people at the company.
In protest, several of Origo’s best reporters resigned.
For Magyar Telekom, Origo had become a public relations liability and a political hindrance, and executives wanted to sell.
Flush With Government Cash
<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Throughout 2014,</span> Magyar Telekom held talks with prospective buyers but decided against a private sale. The Lazar scandal had caused a public outcry, as critics accused the company of bending to political pressure. Executives wanted the deal to be beyond reproach, so an open bidding process was announced in <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2015 and</span> overseen by Ernst and Young, an international accountancy firm.
The winner was named in November 2015: a firm called New Wave Media, which outbid two rival companies.
New Wave’s profile immediately raised eyebrows. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Their bid was financed by funds controlled by two banks, one owned by Mr. Orban’s government, and another owned by Tamas Szemerey, a cousin of one of Mr. Orban’s former ministers.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">In addition, New Wave was part-owned by Mr. Szemerey’s longtime business partner, company records show.
</span>Mr. Szemerey had made earlier attempts to buy Origo directly. But by his own telling, Magyar Telekom executives had discouraged such a direct attempt, on the grounds that he would be perceived as too close to the government.
Yet Mr. Szemerey ended up helping to pay for Origo all the same.
There was no evidence of favoritism: New Wave had simply made the highest bid. But bolstered by money from the state, New Wave could afford to pay whatever it took to avoid the outlet being sold to businesses not aligned with the government.
“We did not want it in the hands of Soros, or in the hands of people outside Hungary, or people who wanted to influence Hungarian politics against the Hungarian government,” Mr. Szemerey said in an interview.
Magyar Telekom and Deutsche Telekom declined to comment on Mr. Szemerey’s contacts with Telekom officials, but said the deal had been conducted transparently.
Though nominally still private, Origo now became a vessel for the government. Bought in part with government money, Origo now published news that echoed the government’s stance — in particular on migration, Mr. Soros, and the European Union, whose officials have frequently criticized Mr. Orban.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Before, Origo had struggled financially.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Now it was flush with government advertising revenue, which more than tripled following the sale.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span></span> the son of Mr. Orban’s former finance minister became New Wave’s CEO and government advertising revenues kept rising, even as Origo’s coverage became even more aggressively pro-Orban.
</span>At the time, <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 sale</span> of Origo could have been considered an outlier. Then, Origo became one of <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 31 outlets</span> owned by Mr. Orban’s allies, according to research by Atlatszo, an investigative news website.

66861d24a5f104da3398a8ea,49862,"<h3>Analysis | AT&T’s ill-fated media play cost it both time and money</h3>AT&T today is a less valuable, more heavily indebted company than it was <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016 when</span> it announced plans to acquire Time Warner and create a media-communications colossus that would dazzle consumers and shower investors with riches.
Now AT&T’s leadership is back with a new plan: unwinding the deal it once touted as “the model that wins over time.” The company said last week it would spin off its WarnerMedia unit in a <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">complex $43 billion</span> deal that unites it with Discovery Inc. in a new publicly-traded entity.
John Stankey, AT&T’s chief executive, called the company’s latest transformative transaction “an opportunity to unlock value” — leaving unanswered the question of who had locked up the value in the first place.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">While AT&T insists its Time Warner acquisition has paid off financially, many analysts said the telecommunications giant <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">squandered $100 billion</span> on a dalliance with the media and entertainment worlds that could have been better spent elsewhere.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">“Telecom companies have no business whatsoever buying assets that are outside their core expertise,” said Allyn Arden, director at S&P Global Corporate Ratings.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“This was a business they had no business being in.”
AT&T’s pursuit of a comprehensive telecom-media-entertainment strategy certainly left investors unimpressed.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The phone company’s share price barely advanced during a period when stocks more than doubled in value.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">From the announcement of Time Warner’s acquisition to word of its spinoff, shares of AT&T gained <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 12.6 percent</span> compared to <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 112.7 percent</span> increase in the S&<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500.</span>
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The company’s market capitalization — the value of all its outstanding stock — has fallen by <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 percent</span> since the end <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2016,</span> according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">After bingeing on debt — and eliminating <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 45,000 jobs</span> — AT&T confronts a future as the nation’s third-largest provider of wireless services and the No.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 broadband</span> company.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">AT&T’s latest reinvention also is bad news for many retail shareholders.</span> The company has long paid a generous dividend, attracting legions of mom-and-pop investors seeking dependable retirement payouts.
But shedding WarnerMedia will shrink annual dividends by nearly half, from <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $15 billion</span> to between <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $8 billion</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $8.6 billion</span>, the company said.
AT&T shareholders will <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">own 71 percent</span> of the new Discovery, so they will benefit from its future growth. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But many current AT&T investors didn’t sign up for the often bumpy ride of a media growth stock.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">They want reliable income.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">“A lot of holders of AT&T stock are interested in a dividend.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The stock is going to be a lot less attractive to that class of individual investors,” said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, senior counselor at the nonprofit Benton Institute for Broadband and Society.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">One sign of how widely felt AT&T’s cut will be: The Vanguard Group, which holds the company’s shares in dozens of its mutual funds, including the Total Stock Market Index Fund, the world’s largest single fund, is the company’s top shareholder.
</span>By AT&T’s calculations, it’s already made billions of dollars on its original Time Warner deal and expects to make even more through the union of Discovery’s reality television programming and WarnerMedia’s CNN, HBO and Warner Bros. Studios.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">In the deal with Discovery, AT&T shareholders will get stock in the new company.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Based on Discovery’s stock price on <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 14,</span> the day before the transaction was disclosed, those shares would be <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth $59 billion</span></span>.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">AT&T will <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">get $43 billion</span> in cash, securities and WarnerMedia’s agreement to <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">retain $1.5 billion</span> of its debt.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">The telecom giant already has booked an <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $5 billion</span> by selling off WarnerMedia assets, including its stake in the streaming service Hulu, plus billions in cash it’s received from the business <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2018.</span>
</span>“We’re comfortably above <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $100 billion</span> total value we paid when we bought Time Warner,” said Fletcher Cook, AT&T’s vice president for corporate communications.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Yet Discovery’s stock has sagged <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 12 percent</span> since the deal was announced — and the transaction is not scheduled to close until the middle of next year — calling into question whether AT&T’s stake in the new Discovery is really <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth $59 billion</span></span>.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">AT&T’s math also doesn’t include the opportunity cost of <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spending $100 billion</span> on TimeWarner rather than alternatives, such as building out the wireless network needed for an Internet-of-things future.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Limited by the debt it had taken on in the original Time Warner deal, AT&T this year was outspent by Verizon nearly 2-to-1 when the federal government auctioned off mid-band spectrum for 5G networks.</span> As rival Verizon <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">committed $53 billion</span>, AT&T could muster <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only $27 billion</span> for a contest that will be critical to its future.
“If they didn’t have DirecTV and WarnerMedia, they would have gone full throttle on C-band and spent closer <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $50 billion</span>. They were hamstrung,” Arden said.
For AT&T, the about-face on WarnerMedia marks a significant strategic shift after decades of buying and selling other companies.
The corporate saga began <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1984,</span> when the original Bell system was split into the long distance provider AT&T and seven regional phone companies.
More than a decade later, after Congress passed landmark legislation designed to fuel competition among landline, wireless and media companies, AT&T began a series of acquisitions that slowly reassembled much of what had been broken up.
<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2015,</span> it acquired DirecTV before announcing plans to snap up Time Warner the following year. That purchase was delayed when the Trump administration launched an unsuccessful legal challenge on antitrust grounds.
“AT&T has been an acquisition machine for decades. It’s been instrumental to their growth,” said Scott Cleland, president of Precursor, a research consultancy. “Eventually, that strategy ran out of gas.”
Many analysts say the company would have been better off never having gotten involved with Time Warner or DirecTV, the satellite operator it acquired <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 for</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $67 billion</span>. The strategy of owning both media and telecommunications businesses under a single corporate roof, they say, was ill-conceived.
“AT&T is probably getting out of this, at best, break-even or slightly better than that,” said David Barden, senior telecom analyst for Bank of America.
AT&T’s move comes just two weeks after Verizon unloaded its media assets, Yahoo and AOL, in <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $5 billion</span> sale to Apollo Global Management, a private equity firm. But Verizon’s media mistake was far less expensive: It spent <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just $9 billion</span> to acquire the two fading Internet-era stars <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 and</span><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017,</span> at a fraction of what AT&T spent.
AT&T belatedly recognized that making a global success of HBO Max against fierce competition from Netflix and Disney Plus would have required daunting investments. Facing a choice between doubling down and getting out, the company blinked.
“They decided their core competency was connectivity not content,” said Barden, who thinks management made the right call.
As investors mulled the outlook for AT&T and the new Discovery-WarnerMedia combination, it was clear that AT&T has been forced to abandon its ambitious plans and retreat to its roots as a communications company.
Yet AT&T may finally have stumbled onto a promising strategy, as the Discovery deal addresses some of its acknowledged weaknesses. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Executives plan to devote all of <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $43 billion</span> raised by the WarnerMedia spinoff to shrinking the company’s debt load, which has grown <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $169 billion</span>.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">That should accelerate ongoing debt reduction efforts by one year and free up the company to increase spending on its wireless network and to more than double <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 30 million</span> homes its fiber broadband connections, executives said.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">In the short run, AT&T stock may be depressed as dividend-seeking retail investors sell.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">But eventually, professional fund managers who in the past have been underwhelmed by the company’s strategy and repelled by its high debt load will be attracted to the new plan, Barden said.
</span>“AT&T bit off more than they could chew,” said Jeff Kagan, an industry consultant. “But it remains a powerful, strong company.”",,,,,,,,1,,,,,3,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,
66861d24a5f104da3398a8ea,28063,"<h3>Discovery’s departure is ‘shot across the bow’ for Silver Spring, state and region</h3>Across the street from Discovery Communications’ towering headquarters in downtown Silver Spring, Jay Ayaba eyed the line of customers at the Starbucks where he works as a shift supervisor. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">It was almost time for an early afternoon surge, overwhelmingly made up of Discovery employees whom Ayaba has come to know by name, face and order — such as Susie and her extra-hot decaf latte.
</span>“This might be a Discovery rush right here,” Ayaba said, looking over his shoulder.
Ayaba,<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24,</span> remembers how much Discovery’s arrival enlivened Silver Spring. He says it was as if “a whole new community had been built overnight.” <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Now he’s worried about the impact of the company’s announcement Tuesday that it will move its corporate headquarters to New York and relocate most of <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 1,300 Maryland</span> jobs.
</span>“We’re still going to be open,” Ayaba said, “but it’s going to be slower than usual around here.”
Plenty of others share his concerns. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Discovery’s exit will cost Montgomery County and Maryland tens of millions of dollars in lost payroll, tax receipts and vendor sales.</span> It will deprive Silver Spring of the high-profile anchor company — perhaps best-known for airing “Shark Week” — that sparked the suburb’s commercial revival beginning in the late 1990s. It will also force the county to find a new occupant for the landmark edifice close to the Silver Spring Metro station.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">In addition, for the greater Washington region, Discovery’s decision stirred fresh anxiety about structural weaknesses in the area’s economy that hamper its ability to compete for top-quality companies.</span> The headquarters move — largely to be closer to the entertainment industry mecca that is New York — cripples hopes that the Washington region can develop as a national hub for broadcast and digital entertainment media.
[Discovery Communications is selling Md. headquarters and moving to New York.]
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Montgomery’s failed effort to retain several hundred back-office jobs also highlighted the challenges posed by the area’s high prices.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Discovery is moving those positions to Knoxville, Tenn., where it said the cost of living is <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 40 percent</span> lower.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">“It’s unfortunate because this is exactly the type of company Washington is trying to attract: a business that isn’t dependent on government spending and can help diversify the economy,” said Stephen S. Fuller, a regional economist at George Mason University.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“It does damage to our brand and the brand we would like to have, that the Washington area is a good place to do business,” Fuller said.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Discovery executives and Maryland elected officials pushed back against the notion that the company’s decision resulted from an unattractive business climate.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">They said the change was inevitable because of Discovery’s acquisition, <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $14.6 billion</span> cash-and-stock deal that is still in progress, of Scripps Networks Interactive, owner of HGTV, Food Network and the Travel Channel.
</span>The new company would have major offices in three locations — New York, Silver Spring and Knoxville — and it made sense to consolidate operations and reduce that number to two.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">“Our decision has nothing to do with incentives or the business environment in Montgomery County,” chief corporate operating officer David C. Leavy said.</span> “We’ve had a wonderful run [here].”
[Turnabout as fair play? Md. Democrats roast Hogan over Discovery’s move to New York.]
Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said top Discovery executives told him there was nothing the state could have done to prevent the loss.
“They assured us it didn’t have anything to do with Maryland,” Hogan said. “They’re simply going through a merger, as most media outlets are.”
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">But there was no disguising the sobering reality that the state lost out to New York for the high-end, creative jobs — some of which will also go to Los Angeles — and to Tennessee for the low-end positions.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Some technology jobs will also cross the river to Sterling, Va., while several hundred positions will remain in Maryland.
</span>“This is a shot across the bow for this region,” said Bob Buchanan, chairman of <span id=""13"" class=""red"">the Montgomery County Economic Development Corp.</span> “We need to seriously address some of these challenges.”
Discovery’s departure is particularly bitter because it was a homegrown success story, a company founded in Landover <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1985 that</span> grew to be an international powerhouse. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Its exit follows an all-too-familiar pattern in which start-ups take root here, blossom and then are plucked away, often through takeovers, to go to more nurturing business ecosystems.
</span>“We don’t seem to be able to hold on to companies as they scale and become successful,” Fuller said. “Businesses are realizing they get a bigger bang for their buck if they go elsewhere.”
From its origins as the Discovery Channel, dedicated to documentaries and nonfiction television programming, Discovery Communications added channels such as TLC, Animal Planet, the Science Channel and OWN (the Oprah Winfrey Network).
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Discovery was lured to downtown Silver Spring in the late 1990s, when Montgomery County offered an incentives package worth more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $10 million</span> in tax credits, grants and loans to set up shop there.
</span>The company built <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $165 million</span>, 10-story tower. The move was the primary catalyst for the revival of Silver Spring, which enjoyed a surge of development including new restaurants, theaters and minority-owned small businesses.
Discovery’s arrival “put Silver Spring on the map and made it a center of documentary work around the world,” said Doug Duncan, who was Montgomery county executive at the time.
<span id=""16"" class=""red""><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Since 2000,</span> the company has <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">received $12.3 million</span> in local and state tax incentives, grants and loans, according to Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks subsidies.
</span>The company’s departure is “devastating for Silver Spring,” Duncan said. “It is going to be really hard to replace them.”
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">That view was echoed by business owners near Discovery’s headquarter.</span> Half a mile up Georgia Avenue at Crisfield Seafood, Bonnie Swanson was tending to the tail end of the lunch crowd at the restaurant her grandparents opened <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1945.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Swanson said the family business survived waves of economic instability in Silver Spring and <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 recession</span>.</span> But Discovery pulling out of Silver Spring was “petrifying.”
Moving forward, Swanson said, the county and state can’t neglect Silver Spring in favor of other development plans, such as those in Bethesda, saying that Silver Spring had long been “Bethesda’s redheaded stepsister.”
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">Facing the loss of lunchtime foot traffic and Discovery employees who host business dinners at Crisfield, Swanson said her restaurant would “just have to buckle our seat belts and hold on.</span> It’s all we can do.”
A few blocks away, Juancarlo Parkhurst still had a few hours before his restaurant, Lina’s Diner and Bar, opened for dinner. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">He’d heard rumors that Discovery might be pulling out of the area for more than a year, but on Tuesday, he was forced to deal with the prospect of losing much of his happy-hour crowd of Discovery employees.
</span>Parkhurst said Discovery was “really big in helping the renaissance of Silver Spring” but also helped drive rent increases that were straining tenants.
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">“Now that there’s no longer this anchor tenant and thousands of employees, it’s very scary as a business operator,” Parkhurst said.
</span>Discovery’s decision dealt a potentially fatal setback to ambitions in the Washington area to become a major player in the entertainment industry.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">Economists said consolidation among media companies has already helped fuel an exodus in the sector.</span> BET Networks, the country’s largest cable network for African American audiences, relocated its headquarters from Northeast Washington to New York last summer. Executives said the move was part of a years-long transition into the Manhattan offices of its parent company, Viacom, which bought BET <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $3 billion</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2000.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">The company had <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 40 full</span>-time employees <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 36 freelancers</span> in Washington.
</span>Silver Spring is still home to Urban One, which <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">operates 55 radio</span> stations targeting African American listeners. But Discovery was the flagship company for this region’s hopes to secure a permanent niche in the industry.
“We have advocacy media and are the information center for political reasons, but not necessarily for documentaries or film entertainment,” Buchanan said.
<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Business leaders said Discovery’s decision highlighted the importance for the Washington region to promote economic sectors where the area already enjoys a competitive advantage and thus has good prospects to succeed.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">Such sectors include cybersecurity, biotechnology, hospitality and financial services, industries with leading companies in the Washington area.</span> A Silver Spring pharmaceutical company, United Therapeutics, has been expanding.
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">The Greater Washington Partnership, an alliance of chief executives of large employers, last month urged greater efforts in the area to train digital technology workers to aid all of those sectors.
</span>“Regions need to focus on their strengths,” said Peter L. Scher, vice chairman of the partnership and chairman of the Mid-Atlantic region for JPMorgan Chase. “What’s important for the region is to keep its eye on the ball. What are the growth sectors, and how do we continue to nurture them?”
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">The need to do more to promote growth separate from the federal government has become acute in recent years because of mandated government budget cuts in the process known as sequestration.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Economic growth has been weak <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010,</span> compared with other big metro areas, as the region struggles to add new, well-paying jobs.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">The jobs it has added — many of them in the service industry — are often low-paid positions with high turnover rates.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">Among the country’<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 15 largest</span> metropolitan areas, the Washington region ranks last in job creation and income growth, according to data from the Stephen S. Fuller Institute at GMU.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">As Discovery showed by shipping low-end jobs to Tennessee, the Washington region struggles to compete when business costs are a factor.
</span>Montgomery and Maryland officials offered undisclosed incentives to Discovery to offset the lower costs in Knoxville, but the gap was too wide to bridge.
<span id=""32"" class=""red"">“There’s no question it’s cheaper to do business in Knoxville,” said Leavy, the Discovery executive.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">“They don’t have a state income tax.</span> Property values are in <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 40 percent</span> <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 50 percent</span> range,” compared with those in Montgomery, he said.
<span id=""34"" class=""red"">Discovery also pointed to other cost advantages in Tennessee.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">According to <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2017 business</span> tax index, it said, Tennessee ranked 13th best while Maryland was 42nd.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Tennessee’s corporate income tax rate <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 6.5 percent</span>, compared with Maryland’<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 8.25 percent</span>.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">According to the Council for Community and Economic Research, the cost of living in Knoxville <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 41 percent</span> below that of Silver Spring, Rockville and Frederick.
</span>Discovery’s move did not come as a surprise to close observers of the company. It has cut its workforce in Silver Spring by nearly half over the past decade. Chief executive David Zaslav, a native New Yorker who took over the company <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007,</span> has been living in Manhattan in recent years even though the company’s headquarters was in Maryland.
“When the new guy came in, there didn’t seem to be any connection between him and the county, between him and Silver Spring,” Duncan, the former county executive, said.
That was in contrast with Discovery’s founder, John Hendricks, who had close relations with Duncan and other local officials. A West Virginia native, Hendricks was running a Maryland consulting firm before he launched Discovery <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1985 with</span> <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $5 million</span> investment from Allen & Co., a boutique New York investment firm known for its media expertise. The timing was right. Cable pioneer John Malone was searching for content for his nascent cable system, and he invested in Discovery and agreed to carry the channel. It hit the airwaves with an after-school special on icebergs.
<span id=""38"" class=""red"">In time, the network was a giant of reality TV, the home of shows such as “19 Kids and Counting,” “The Crocodile Hunter” and “Dirty Jobs.”
</span>Hendricks lured Zaslav, who <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">turns 58 on</span> Monday, from a top post at NBC Universal <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007 to</span> become its chief executive.
“Working with John gave me the fever,” Zaslav said in <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2006 interview</span> with The Washington Post, calling Hendricks “a mentor.”
<span id=""39"" class=""red"">Zaslav overhauled the company, closing its retail stores, ousting veteran executives and reducing the workforce <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 20 percent</span>.</span> He rebranded some of the channel’s properties, making it leaner and more profitable.
“David is a hard-driving guy, direct but likable,” said Hugh Panero, founder and former chief executive at XM Satellite Radio and an adjunct professor at the George Washington University School of Media and Public Affairs. “He came to Discovery when it was down, and he turned it around. He is very focused, smart. He identifies what needs to be fixed . . . sees the pins and knocks them down, pursuing his objectives relentlessly.”
Malone, who sits on the Discovery board, is reportedly a fan.
“Malone does not suffer fools,” said Panero, who has known Zaslav since they worked together in New York media <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">circles 30 years</span> ago. “For Malone, it’s all about what you deliver. He thinks very highly of him.”
Zaslav was well rewarded. <span id=""40"" class=""red"">He is one of the most highly compensated people in the country, <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">earning $341 million</span> in cash, stock and other benefits over company fiscal <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">years 2012 through</span><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> according to Equilar, an executive data firm.</span> Total shareholder return during that period <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 34 percent</span>, according to Equilar.
The news hasn’t all been bad for Montgomery and Maryland. Last year, state and county officials succeeded in keeping Marriott International in Montgomery. <span id=""41"" class=""red"">They <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">offered $62 million</span> in loans, tax credits and grants to build a new headquarters in Bethesda, where the hospitality giant has been based <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 40 years</span>.
</span>Once Discovery leaves, however, Maryland will be the home of only two <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Fortune 500 companies</span></span> other than Marriott: Lockheed Martin and Host Hotels & Resorts.
<span id=""42"" class=""red"">The loss of Discovery “is a real setback, both symbolically and in terms of local employment,” said Anirban Basu, an economist at Baltimore-based Sage Policy Group.</span> “Maryland is not home to many <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Fortune 500 companies</span></span>, and to lose this headquarters represents an unsightly blemish for the state.”

66861d24a5f104da3398a8ea,58696,"<h3>Amy Klobuchar Talks Health Care, Israel and, Yes, That Comb</h3>There was no real doubt what the first question to Senator Amy Klobuchar would be.
Backstage at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., where Ms. Klobuchar was the first in a series of presidential candidates to be interviewed on Saturday, the interviewer, Kara Swisher, asked: “Do you want to start with the comb or end with the comb?”
“We’re going to start with the comb,” Ms. Swisher, the co-founder of the technology news website Recode and a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, concluded.
“The comb” was a reference to a February New York Times article about how Ms. Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, treats her staff in the Senate. <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2008,</span> The Times reported, an aide bought her a salad in an airport but fumbled the plastic utensils. On the plane, Ms. Klobuchar berated the aide, pulled a comb out of her purse and ate the salad with it.
“It was me sort of doing a mom thing,” Ms. Klobuchar responded at Saturday’s event, co-sponsored by The Texas Tribune. “I didn’t have a fork. I used a comb to eat a salad very briefly on a plane in a MacGyver move.”
The fact that Ms. Klobuchar ate salad with a comb was not the main conclusion of the Times report. She did not mention on Saturday that, after finishing the salad, she handed the comb to the aide and ordered him to clean it.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The article, based on interviews with more than two dozen former aides, also included details about how her Senate office employees who took paid parental leave were expected to stay in their job for three times as many weeks as they had taken off — and that if they didn’t, according to an employee handbook, they would be required to pay back the money earned during their leave.
</span>In response to the article, Ms. Klobuchar’s office said it had never enforced that policy and would change the handbook. She did not address that on Saturday, and Ms. Swisher did not ask.
Ms. Klobuchar, who has previously said she “can be tough on people,” acknowledged — as she has in past responses to reports on her treatment of her staff — that she was “sometimes too tough.” “I can push them too hard,” she said. “I can always do better.”
Ms. Swisher then asked if Ms. Klobuchar felt the coverage of her treatment of staff members was sexist, given that many male politicians act similarly.
“I’m not going to go there,” she said, adding, “Whatever it is, I just can’t waste my time analyzing it, because the stakes are too high, and I care too much. That’s why I announced my candidacy in the middle of a blizzard by the Mississippi River.”
In the rest of the interview, Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Swisher had wide-ranging discussions on health care, technology, foreign policy and other issues. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Ms. Klobuchar expressed support for several policies to lower drug prices, including importing products from Canada (“In Minnesota, we can see Canada from our porch,” she joked); ending the “pay for delay” practice in which big pharmaceutical companies pay manufacturers not to produce generics; and allowing the government to negotiate drug prices with Medicare, a perennial proposal from Democrats.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">She criticized the relatively short sentence given to the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in his financial fraud case this week, citing her experience prosecuting white-collar crime and declaring, “You can’t have two systems of justice, one for the rich and powerful and one for everyone else.”</span> She denounced President Trump for his attacks on the news media, saying he “tweets whatever he wants in the morning but doesn’t respect the amendment that allows him to do it.”
She also said she disagreed with Representative Ilhan Omar’s recent comments about American politicians’ support for Israel, “because I believe you can be true to your country and advocate for another country, whether it is Israel or Canada or Ethiopia” — but condemned Mr. Trump for emboldening intolerance, including anti-Semitism, and noted Ms. Omar’s own background as a refugee.
Asked about a recent proposal by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another presidential candidate, to break up big tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, Ms. Klobuchar refused to commit to it. But she endorsed antitrust action and the breakup of monopolies broadly as “one of the governing principles for ensuring that we have a capitalist system.”
Ms. Warren also appeared at South by Southwest on Saturday, speaking with Anand Giridharadas of Time magazine. Mr. Giridharadas began the interview by telling everyone in the audience who either worked for or hoped to work for one of those tech giants to stand, and then asking Ms. Warren to explain to them why she wanted to break up their companies.
Picking Amazon as her example, Ms. Warren condemned the ability of such giants to, essentially, play on a field they control. Amazon not only runs a marketplace, she said, but uses its vast trove of information about consumers’ behavior in the marketplace to create and promote its own products.
“You can be an umpire — a platform — or you can own teams. That’s fine. But you can’t be an umpire and own one of the teams that’s in the game,” she said. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Break those things apart and we will have a much more competitive, robust market in America.</span> That’s how capitalism should work.”
“The monopolist will make fewer monopoly profits,” she added. “Boo-hoo.”
Pressed on what this outlook said about her philosophical differences with Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running on a democratic socialist platform, Ms. Warren said she wanted capitalism to work better.
“There’s an enormous amount to be gained from markets,” she said. “But markets have to have rules. They have to have a cop on the beat. Markets without rules are theft.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">As in her stump speeches, Ms. Warren also spoke at length about the systemic effects of racism, especially in worsening economic inequality.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">In the 1960s, she noted, when redlining and other forms of housing discrimination were legal, the homeownership gap between black and white Americans <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 27 percentage</span> points.</span> Today, it <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 30 percentage</span> points.
“Race matters,” she said. “And until we say so and attack the problem head on, we are not going to fix it.”
Former Gov. John Kasich of Ohio was also interviewed at the festival on Saturday, as was the Starbucks founder and possible independent presidential candidate Howard Schultz.
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and former Gov. Bill Weld of Massachusetts, who is challenging Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination, were also on the schedule.",,,,,,,,,,,5,,3,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,

How a Dog’s Killing Turned Brooklyn Progressives Against One Another
After a sudden confrontation that left a golden retriever dead, neighbors came together online to support the owner of the dog. But then things changed.
Supported by
Real-world ethics question: In a well-used city park, a man with a history of erratic behavior attacks a dog and its owner with a stick; five days later, the dog dies. The man is Black, the dog owner white; the adjoining neighborhood is famously progressive, often critical of the police and jail system. At the same time, crime is up in the neighborhood, with attacks by emotionally disturbed people around the city putting some residents on edge.
In a dog-loving, progressive enclave, where pushing law and order can clash with calls for social justice, what’s the right thing to do? How do you protect the public without furthering injustice against this man?
Here’s what happened in Park Slope, Brooklyn, when real-life residents faced this situation.
On Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3,</span> Jessica Chrustic,<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 40,</span> a professional beekeeper, was walking her dog in Prospect Park a little <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 6 a</span>.m. when she saw a man rifling through the garbage outside the Picnic House. She had seen the man before — tall, with dreadlocks wrapped in a turban, carrying a long staff and often muttering to himself or cursing — and she usually kept her distance. But this morning there was no room to avoid him.
According to Ms. Chrustic, he started yelling about immigrants taking over the park, then grabbed a bottle of what she later concluded was urine and sloshed it at her and her dog. She tried to run away, but Moose, her 80-pound golden retriever mix, was straining toward the man, trying to protect her.
The man started swinging the stick, she said. One blow hit her, not seriously. Another connected solidly with the dog’s snout. Mary Rowland,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 56,</span> a hospital manager who was walking her dog nearby, said she heard the crack of wood on bone and came running toward them, screaming at the man to get away.
Both women <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">called 911,</span> and four patrol cars arrived within a few minutes. But by then, the man was gone. “Moose was bleeding from his mouth and pulling to get home,” Ms. Chrustic said. “My focus was just on caring for him.”
Ms. Chrustic was physically unhurt, but she was shaken. How could this happen in a park where she had never felt unsafe, even walking her dog late at night?
Moose had a shattered tooth that needed to be pulled. Ms. Chrustic posted a description of the encounter on the neighborhood social network Nextdoor, warning others about the man and asking them to report any sightings to the police. Her post elicited more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 280 comments</span> in the coming weeks, mostly expressing sympathy. A total stranger on the forum offered to make her a bracelet with the name Moose on it.
But then the next weekend, Moose developed sepsis from a perforated intestine, caused by a blow Ms. Chrustic had not noticed. After emergency surgery, Moose died.
Weeks passed, and the man who attacked the dog was still at large. People on Nextdoor, working from Ms. Chrustic’s description, posted that they had seen him in one part of the park or another. Ms. Chrustic, who used to visit the park four times a day, now found it too traumatic to enter unless necessary.
She was especially frustrated that the man, who was well known to people in the park, had not been arrested. “You have a person who is walking around the park who is violent and needs to be removed,” she said. “He’s known by the community. It’s disheartening.”
It was a random incident that might once have been discussed by a group of dog owners. But now it had a forum for a much wider community, with arguments about policing, vigilantism, homelessness, mental health care and progressive obstinacy all feeding into a conversation that evolved beyond the crime that set it off.
“It’s complicated,” said S. Matthew Liao, a professor of bioethics, philosophy and public health at New York University. “It’s a conflict of values, between wanting security and social justice. Everybody has a responsibility in some ways.
“There are a bunch of issues here, a bunch of threats,” he added. “We can deal with them in a compassionate way, or a not compassionate way.”
The Nextdoor effect
Nextdoor, which claims an average <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 37 million</span> users per week, started <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010 with</span> the promise of connecting people with their neighbors and neighborhoods. One slogan went, “When neighbors start talking, good things happen.”
One thing they talked about, a lot, was local crime. In Nextdoor forums for communities all over the country, this included suspected crime and sightings of “suspicious” characters, leading early critics to say that what the platform really propagated was white fear. After complaints about racial profiling <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016,</span> the company instituted diversity training for its operations staff and new protocols for posts about crime and safety. But even <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020,</span></span> Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez characterized it as an outlet for privileged white people to vent criminal fantasies about their Black and brown neighbors. She tweeted, “@Nextdoor needs to publicly deal w/ their Karen problem.”
A Nextdoor spokesperson said the company enables users to report any posts that they find offensive or discriminatory, which are then reviewed by volunteer community moderators or staff members. <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2021,</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 1 percent</span> of posts were reported as hurtful or harmful; about half of these were removed.
When Ms. Chrustic posted about the attack, the first responses were mostly notes of condolence and support. People with dogs posted that they had seen the man in the same area where she was attacked — why weren’t the police arresting him? Donations poured in to offset her veterinary bills.
But gradually, other voices emerged. A vocal minority asked why Park Slope residents, mostly white, were calling for the police to take down a man who appeared to be homeless and emotionally disturbed. Others called the man a “monster,” a “predator” or a “psychopath.” As on other social media platforms, the most ardent voices made the most noise.
Martin Lofsnes,<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 52,</span> a dancer and choreographer who moved out of the neighborhood <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020,</span></span> came across the conversation while trying to sell some stuff and was appalled by the vitriol directed at an impoverished man, and by what he called “this vigilante attitude.”
He urged people on the thread to put their emotions aside and consider “400 yrs of systematic racism which has prevented black people from building generational wealth through homeownership resulting in the extreme disparity we see today.” Arresting the man, he wrote, would solve none of that.
With all the affluence in Park Slope, he posted, maybe critics should raise money to help the man, not throw him to the lethal jail system, from which he would most likely emerge more dangerous, or not emerge at all.
Others called Mr. Lofsnes naïve or accused him of mansplaining, or told him to take his comments to another thread.
“It’s easy to say that you’re for prison reform and you’re a liberal, until it happens to you,” Mr. Lofsnes said in an interview. “When it happens to you, you have to deal with it. You have to take a step back, even in that heated situation where her dog died, and say, ‘What does this do in the larger scheme of things?’”
To Ms. Chrustic and many on Nextdoor, the issue was simple: A man who killed a dog and attacked its owner was a risk to everyone. She asked people who saw the man to <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">call 911 and</span> to send her photographs so she could confirm that it was really him.
Though most people on the site were supportive, some of the commentary and messages disturbed her. She was accused of not cooperating with the police; some suggested that she did not deserve a dog because she had not protected hers. “People can be horrible,” she said. “And people also take it as an opportunity to vent. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">It becomes a politically divisive conversation I have no interest in being a part of.”
</span>She worked with a police artist to create a sketch of the man, even though part of his face had been covered during the attack. The sketch went up on Nextdoor, and police officers posted it in the park, prompting more reports of sightings.
For Nicole Haddad, who stopped going to the park with her pitbull-vizsla mix, Kingsley, after he was the victim of a similar attack three years ago, Ms. Chrustic’s posts hit home. Since then, Ms. Haddad said, Kingsley has been fearful and sometimes aggressive and has needed expensive behavioral specialists and anti-anxiety medication.
“When I read Jessica’s post, I got really, really triggered,” she said. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">“I just knew the journey that Jessica was going to be in for, because it’s caused me emotional and financial duress.</span> I reached out to her immediately.” The two women compared information and concluded that their dogs were attacked by the same man. To the people who focused more on social justice than removing a threat, Ms. Haddad said: “I tell those people to shut up. They don’t have a leg to stand on.
“I don’t care that it’s being divisive, and that people don’t want to see this guy die in Rikers Island,” Ms. Haddad added. “I’m a New York liberal. I am absolutely for people getting the help they need. But this person is attacking people and killing dogs. He’s targeting women and dogs. He’s violent. He should not be in the park. He should be locked up and paying for his actions.”
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Don’t be a cop, Kris
Kristian Nammack,<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 59,</span> who works in sustainable financing, read the Moose posts on Nextdoor and grew frustrated that nothing seemed to be happening.</span> So he decided to do something about it. He invited people on Nextdoor and Meetup to form a neighborhood watch group to “take our neighborhood back.” As an enticement, he created a logo and <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">printed 10 T</span>-shirts. “We may also get to wear cool berets,” his solicitation offered, nodding to the Guardian Angels, an anti-crime “safety patrol” prominent in the ’70s and ’80s.
Mr. Nammack’s name for the new group: Park Slope Panthers.
He did not see the backlash coming.
“In my mind it was getting people to provide some visibility of community members in the park, especially at hours when women feel vulnerable, <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">like 6 to</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 9,</span>” he said. “Not vigilantes, not with guns, not with the intention to tackle an attacker, but just to be another physical presence. I think just a presence deters crime.”
Mr. Nammack, who was involved in ACT UP and Occupy Sandy, presents himself as a soft-spoken voice of reason, with a Quaker background and a longstanding commitment to progressive causes. He was surprised suddenly to be embraced by people to the right of him. He said he was invited to appear on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” and to meet with Curtis Sliwa, the Guardian Angels founder who ran a tough-on-crime campaign for mayor. Flustered, he declined both.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Then there was the group’s name, which was an immediate flash point: a white financial services guy using the Panther name to take action against a Black man.</span> At the group’s first and only meeting, the scattering of potential volunteers was met by a group of four people, all white, who showed up to disrupt the proceedings.
As described in the news site Hell Gate and the newsletter Common Sense, things went awry almost from the start. A man calling himself Snow told the group, “We are super not into you guys having your meeting, or doing anything in the park,” according to Hell Gate. “The opposite of what we need right now is more cops in this park and more people who want to be helping the cops in this park, when people are already being, like, chased down by the cops.”
To the delight of people who enjoy making fun of Park Slope liberals, one of the disrupters, a woman calling herself Sky, said, “Crime is an abstract term that means nothing in a lot of ways,” according to Common Sense.
A few days after the meeting, someone spray-painted the sidewalk outside Mr. Nammack’s apartment: “Don’t Be a Cop, Kris.” It rattled him. “Even being gay, I don’t know that I’ve ever been the target of hate,” he said. “I felt that I was the target of hate.” He decided he did not have the time or energy to continue the group.
On Nextdoor, people seemed to be dug into their positions. Many bundled the lack of an arrest with the rise of other crimes in the neighborhood. Serious crimes in the 78th Precinct, which includes Park Slope, are <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 50 percent</span> from two years ago, though well below the highs of the early 1990s.
A spokesperson for the Police Department said they were conducting canvasses of the park but would not comment on why there had been no arrest. At a virtual town meeting, Capt. Frantz Souffrant noted that numerous people in the area wear dreadlocks and carry staves. Ms. Rowland — the woman who witnessed the assault — went on at least three rides with officers to confirm a sighting. Each time the person was gone, or it was the wrong man.
Both Ms. Chrustic and Mr. Nammack separately appealed to their representative on the City Council, Shahana Hanif, for help, but they came away feeling her staff members were more concerned with the safety of the man — whom they presumed to be homeless and mentally ill — than with the threat he might pose to others.
Mr. Nammack said he was told: “‘We don’t want the police involved in this.’” He said, “They didn’t seem concerned that there was a public safety threat with this man at large, and that he needs to be dealt with. The bigger concern was keeping this man out of Rikers, and let’s not do anything.”
Under New York law, depending on the level of cruelty, killing a dog can be a misdemeanor or a felony, carrying a prison sentence of up to two years. Michael Whitesides, a spokesperson for Ms. Hanif, called the situation complicated. “We don’t believe that the N.Y.P.D. is the vehicle to bring safety to our community,” Mx. Whitesides said. “When it comes to this individual, they’re clearly a present danger to others and most likely themselves, and figuring out how we can safely de-escalate that situation without putting anyone else in danger is complicated.”
The debate, Mx. Whitesides said, was simply what happens when progressive priorities clash. “Even among the progressives, everyone wants to be safe,” they said. “These debates in the community, while they can feel very tense — this is how we find a solution. It’s going to come through neighbors talking to neighbors.”
Can you support social justice and the police?
On a recent afternoon, nearly two months after the attack, the park was a 526-acre sanctuary from social media and liberal hand-wringing, its tree-lined paths and open fields indifferent to the disputations among its users. Schoolchildren, let out into the exquisite early fall afternoon, fanned excitedly over the gently sloping lawn, as a police cruiser idled nearby, its misery lights flashing. The park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who designed Central Park, both connects and separates the disparate neighborhoods around it.
Ms. Chrustic was willing to talk on a bench outside the park, but not to enter within. Like Mr. Nammack, she felt compelled to stress her progressive bona fides, including volunteer work she’d done for homeless organizations. She wore the M-O-O-S-E bracelet given to her through Nextdoor. “And I don’t even wear bracelets usually,” she said.
She said she still had not moved Moose’s bed or food bowls in her apartment.
“I’m very empathetic toward people who are unhoused and are having hard times and who have mental illness,” she said. “I think that there should be more resources for them. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">There should be more housing situations.</span> But what I emphasize is that this is just one person who needs to be removed from the park. He’s violent. End of story.”
For two months, she has grown increasingly impatient with the police, local officials and neighbors on Nextdoor who seemed more concerned about her attacker’s welfare than her safety.
“Are they waiting for somebody to die?” she said. “Are they waiting for someone to get hurt more severely? I was lucky. My dog was not. What happens to the next person? What happens if it’s a child? How many more people need to be harmed?”
Mr. Nammack, for his part, had come to see his failed effort to start a community watch group, and the disastrous meetup, as a successful exercise in democracy. He had solicited a range of viewpoints, and he got them. “The Saturday meeting, looking back, it was great,” he said. “It brought up a lot of issues. It was quite diverse. It left more open questions than answers. They’re all good questions, but I don’t have the bandwidth to answer. So I feel like I opened a can of worms, and I’m walking away from it.”
For now, he was urging people to sign a petition on Change.org, demanding that Mayor Eric Adams “take appropriate action to rectify this matter.” More <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 600 people</span> have signed the petition.
But Mr. Nammack was not done. After a brief ban from Nextdoor, which was never explained, he returned to the fray. Once again he posted the police sketch of Ms. Chrustic’s attacker, above the headline: STILL AT LARGE. PROSPECT PARK VAGRANT. VIOLENT AND SOCIOPATHIC.
Twenty-seven people clicked that they liked the post. Then Mr. Nammack’s posts were removed again.

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 12,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014 12</span>:59 pm ET

NORFOLK, Va.—With J.C. Penney Co. and Sears Holdings Corp. racing to close stores, America's weakest malls are being pushed to the brink.

Nearly half of <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1,050 indoor</span> and open air malls in the U.S. have both of those struggling chains as anchor tenants, according to real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Of those malls, nearly a quarter are struggling with sales <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $300 per</span> square foot and vacancy rates <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 20%,</span> meaning they will have a hard time finding new tenants if old ones leave.

</span>For an already-weakened mall industry, the negative turn for two once-reliable anchors is promising more stress at a time when the Internet is steadily stealing traffic. And the pressure is only growing. Sears Chief Executive Eddie Lampert this week said he plans to close more stores to help return the company to profitability.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Vacancy rates rose and sales plunged at the Gallery at Military Circle, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 5 miles</span> from downtown Norfolk, Va., after the Sears store closed its doors two years ago.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Eventually the mall's owner missed multiple payments on its debt.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Remaining retail tenants worry about what will happen when the Penney store closes this month, darkening another corner of the 44-year-old property.

</span>Bruce Van, who manages Gent's, a locally owned boutique specializing in men's suits and fedoras and Sunday church clothes, said foot traffic fell by more than half after the Sears closed.

""When J.C. Penney goes out in May, it's going to be bad,"" said Mr. Van, who is also pastor at Rivers of Life Fellowship in Hampton, Va.

The first U.S. indoor mall opened in Edina, Minn., <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1956,</span> and construction peaked in the 1980s. Only six new malls have been built <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010,</span> according to CoStar Group, a provider of commercial real-estate information. Meanwhile, the number of ""dead malls,"" those with vacancy rates <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 40%,</span> has nearly tripled <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2006 to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 74 properties</span>.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The fate of the mall business matters, because even as the industry struggles, it remains an important source of economic activity.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Sales per square foot at the nation's malls grew <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 2.6% last</span> year—their slowest pace <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2009,</span> according to International Council of Shopping Centers.</span> Vacancy rates are stubbornly high, at an average of more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 8% at</span> regional malls, not far off <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2011 peak</span> in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 9.4%,</span> according to data company Reis Inc.

""Just because people are making fewer trips to the mall doesn't mean they're spending less,"" said Jesse Tron, a spokesman for the ICSC. Mr. Tron said that malls are trying to reinvent themselves by adding entertainment like indoor golf courses and higher-end restaurants, as well as services such as same-day delivery.

Still, it is tough to reverse such high vacancy rates when large anchor-tenant retailers like Sears and Penney are closing stores and others like Macy's Inc. are opening fewer locations.

Penney, which racked <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up $2.4 billion</span> in losses over the past two years, plans to <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">close 33 of</span> its stores, most of them in malls. Sears, with losses <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $2.3 billion</span> over the same period, has <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">closed 116 of</span> its full-line Sears stores <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010.</span> Penney and Sears declined to comment.

To be sure, the exit of a troubled retailer can create an opportunity for stronger malls to find healthier tenants. But it is a different situation for struggling malls. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">And the potential damage from losing an anchor tenant is especially high in malls that have both Penney and Sears as tenants, said Gary Balter, a retail analyst with Credit Suisse.</span> ""If one of them goes, it almost forces the other one out, because the mall just won't get enough traffic,"" Mr. Balter said.

The exit of an anchor can cause other stores to leave or renegotiate their leases, contributing to a spiral of declining traffic and investment.

At the Gallery at Military Circle, the cavernous,<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 128,000</span>-square-foot space once occupied by Sears remains empty. ""For Lease"" posters dot the windows of other darkened storefronts.

The mall's situation is already tenuous. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">In November, and again in February and April, Thor Equities LLC, its owner, missed payments on <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $53 million</span> securitized loan, and Thor is in talks to restructure the debt, according to Trepp LLC, a company that collects data on real-estate debt.

</span>The Gallery is hanging on to its other anchors—Macy's at the north end and an 18-screen Cinemark Holdings Inc. movie theater on the south. A Macy's spokesman said the retailer has no plans to leave. Cinemark didn't return calls seeking comment.

At the Southlake Mall in Morrow, Ga., after the Penney there closed in <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2011,</span> a number of national-chain tenants had their rent payments reduced, real-estate executives said. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The mall's total sales fell <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $58 million</span> in January <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $60 million</span> in the year Penney closed as vacancies rose.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Several retailers at the mall said their sales have fallen <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 30% since</span> Penney left.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">""J.C. Penney brought people to the mall,"" said Joseph Nguyen, who operates a jewelry-repair kiosk near the food court and was one of the retailers whose sales fell off.

</span>Southlake occupied what was considered prime real estate in suburban Clayton County when the property was built just off <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Interstate 75 in</span><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1976.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Housing developments were springing up as the city expanded southward, bringing in new residents and eager shoppers.

</span>Over the past decade, however, Southlake's fortunes have turned. Newer shopping destinations in neighboring Henry County pulled customers away. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Clayton County lost jobs when a nearby Ford Motor Co. plant closed <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006.</span></span> The mall took a further hit when Clayton County dropped bus service two years ago.

Southlake lost its first anchor <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003,</span> when Macy's closed one of its two stores at the mall. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Unable to find another retail tenant, General Growth Properties, which bought the mall <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1997,</span> turned the space into offices and a convention center.</span> General Growth filed for <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Chapter 11 bankruptcy</span> protection <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009 and</span> emerged <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span> A year later, Penney left Southlake mall.

While the mall's occupancy rate has remained <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 90%,</span> Southlake has lost several national players, including The Limited and Gap clothing chains and the Chick-fil-A fast-food restaurant.

""Two anchors aren't enough to draw people to the mall,"" said Michelle Laidig, who has worked at Southlake <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 25 years</span>. ""The mall used to be a destination. Now the locals just come here to return items they bought at other malls.""

The future may be turning around. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Vintage Real Estate LLC, which acquires and redevelops underperforming malls, bought Southlake in April for an undisclosed price and plans to <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">invest $3 million</span> to revitalize the property.

</span>""We talked to every tenant,"" Vintage Chairman Fred Sands said. ""We found out how they are doing and what the facility needs.""

Mr. Sands said he is negotiating with new restaurants for the food court and is interviewing tenants to take over the former Penney space.

The chairman disputes the idea that the mall was hurt by Penney's closing. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Sales excluding newly opened or closed stores have held steady at <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $320 per</span> square foot <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2011,</span> according to documents Mr. Sands provided.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Lost business from Penney was offset by increased sales from the mall'<span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 16 shoe</span> retailers, including Foot Locker and Athlete's Foot, he said.

</span>RaeQuel Fagin, a 20-year-old-restaurant worker who met a friend at the food court on a recent Tuesday afternoon, said the mall was a good place to come for sneaker releases, but not for much else.

""I wouldn't say this is where I would come if I felt like shopping,"" Ms. Fagin said.

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 8,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 2</span>:27 am ET

Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, said hackers stole more <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $40 million</span> worth of bitcoin from its platform in what it called a “large scale security breach.”

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The theft offers another example of the vulnerability facing cryptocurrencies and the venues where investors trade them.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Yet the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies barely budged after the robbery was disclosed Wednesday morning in Asia.

</span>Binance said it discovered Tuesday <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 7,000 bitcoins</span> were stolen from a single wallet, amounting to <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 2% of</span> the company’s total bitcoin holdings.

Hackers used phishing, viruses and other techniques, the company said. Binance said they had obtained information about multiple users, including two-factor authentication codes. Industry participants said they believed it was the first major breach at Binance.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Binance, which was founded in China but now operates outside the country, said it was suspending deposits and withdrawals for one week while it conducts a security review, although users will still be able to trade existing funds.</span> Stolen funds would be refunded through its emergency insurance account, the company said.

“The hackers had the patience to wait, and execute well-orchestrated actions through multiple seemingly independent accounts at the most opportune time,” Binance said. “The transaction is structured in a way that [it] passed our existing security checks. It was unfortunate that we were not able to block this withdrawal before it was executed.”

In a video posted on Twitter following the disclosed hack, Changpeng Zhao, chief executive at Binance, described the incident as “a very advanced, persistent hacking effort.” <span id=""4"" class=""red"">He said trading might need to be halted “for a couple of hours here and there” due to system upgrades.

</span>He said Binance has the funds to back the stolen amount. “It does hurt very much but we are able to cover that,” he said in the video. “We are not short on funds right now,” he added.

Hacks were a primary reason for bitcoin’s steep fall last year following its manic rally <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">While bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, is up more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 50% so</span> far this year, it remains down by <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 70% from</span> its record high in <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2017.</span>

</span>“People are quite used to exchange hacks,” said John Patrick Mullin, a cryptocurrency investor and blockchain consultant in Hong Kong. “Markets didn’t move nearly as much as they would’ve one year ago if the same thing happened.”

Bitcoin recently traded <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $5,800,</span> according to CoinDesk.

Cryptocurrency exchanges and investors are often targeted by hackers. More <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1.7 billion</span> has been publicly reported stolen over the years, mostly from exchanges in Asia, including Japanese platforms Mt. Gox and Coincheck.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Last month, the New York attorney general’s office said an exchange called Bitfinex had covered up a loss <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $850 million</span> of corporate and customer funds by using the reserves of the digital currency it controls, tether.

</span>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies exist on independent networks and operate on the blockchain, a public record of transactions. In an effort to replicate the anonymity of physical cash, those transactions aren’t connected to an identity. The anonymity is appealing to bitcoin proponents but is also attractive to hackers and makes it tough to catch thieves.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">“Hacking risks are part of the business reality for crypto exchanges,” said Henri Arslanian, global crypto leader at PwC. “While crypto exchanges are becoming increasingly better prepared, hackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated as well.”

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 26,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 12</span>:31 pm ET

Anheuser-Busch InBev NV still has a way to go in its quest to woo increasingly fickle American drinkers.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The brewer behind Budweiser and Bud Light on Thursday said U.S. revenue <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 3.1% in</span> the second quarter on the back of lower volumes, as both brands continued to lose market share.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The weak performance was a factor in the company missing overall sales growth forecasts, prompting shares to drop more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 5%.</span>

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Sales of the two brands have fallen as once-loyal American consumers shift away from domestic lagers toward craft beers, Mexican imports, wine and spirits.

</span>In response, the company is trying to persuade consumers to buy more expensive beers, rolling out Michelob Ultra Pure Gold, made with organic grains, and Bud Light Orange, brewed with citrus peels. It also plans to launch pricier variants of Budweiser, including a beer aged on bourbon barrel staves, due to begin selling next month.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">On Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Felipe Dutra said there was “no silver bullet, no short term answer to some of the problems we face,” in the U.S., although he added the company’s efforts to innovate and go upmarket were bearing fruit.

</span>AB InBev pointed to some signs of improvement, noting quarterly share losses in the U.S. had slowed, with <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.35 percentage</span> point drop in the last quarter its best quarterly performance in almost four years. It said Michelob Ultra—marketed as a beer for people with an active lifestyle—continued to perform well.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Overall, AB InBev reported a jump in net profit <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1.94 billion</span> for the three months to <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 30,</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $1.5 billion</span> a year earlier, as lower costs helped offset <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1.2% fall</span> in revenue <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $14.01 billion</span>.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Stripping out currency changes and acquisitions, sales <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">grew 4.7%,</span> missing analyst estimates for growth <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 5.4%.</span></span> Shares <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 4.2% in</span> Brussels following the results.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">While some multinationals have said tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are pushing up costs, Mr. Dutra said AB InBev’s costs haven’t risen yet as the company is still protected by hedges.</span> It will begin to feel the impact from these next year.

Outside of the U.S., results were buoyed by Brazil, Mexico, China and Western Europe, helped by the soccer World Cup in Russia, and AB InBev’s efforts to sell pricier drinks.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The World Cup didn’t help sales in the U.S., where viewership was lower than for past tournaments as a result of the American team’s failure to qualify.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">AB InBev said its sponsorship of the soccer tournament was an opportunity to boost sales of Budweiser in international markets as revenue for the beer outside of the U.S. was up by more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10%.</span>

</span>Volume growth in Brazil was slightly hampered by a truck strike, offsetting gains from the World Cup.

The company also announced some organizational changes to spur growth.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">It will combine ZX Ventures, a unit founded <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 to</span> develop new products for emerging consumer needs, with its marketing arm.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The innovation unit in April bought a U.K.-based spirits, e-commerce and import business.

</span>“In order to continue to grow, we have anticipate the future,” said Chief Executive Carlos Brito on a call with investors. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Bringing the two units together “will help us achieve our objective of anticipating market and consumers trends,” he added.

</span>AB InBev is also creating a new position: a head of nonalcoholic beverages. Millennials and so-called “Generation Z” are drinking less than older generations, spurring booze makers to launch more low-alcohol and nonalcoholic products.

Nonalcoholic drinks—which mostly include energy drinks and nonalcoholic beers—make up more <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10% of</span> AB InBev’s volumes.

The company is also restructuring its management, collapsing nine geographical divisions into six in a move it said would help it become more agile following its integration of SABMiller, the London-based brewing giant it acquired <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span>

66861d24a5f104da3398a8ea,92520,"<h3>Governor races in at least five states could determine abortion legality</h3>Helloo, good morning. Are planes the best place for interviews? We can definitely see some advantages. A quick programming note: The <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Health 202 is</span> publishing three days this week. But we’ll be back to our regular schedule next week — see you Monday!

Today’s edition: Nearly half of adults give the U.S. health system a poor or failing grade, per a new report. Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) is rolling out a new campaign critical of drug middlemen. But first ...

Abortion access is at stake in GOP-run states that could elect Democratic governors

The future of abortion access in a handful of battleground states may rest with who wins the governor’s mansion in November.

Democrats are leaning into that message on the campaign trail, seeking to make the November elections a referendum on what they describe as the Republican Party’s extreme position on abortion. This dynamic is playing out in gubernatorial contests in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona — all of which have GOP-controlled state legislatures.

“The landscape changes from state to state, but our message has stayed focused on making sure voters know what a Republican can do to either chip away at current rights or advance existing restrictions,” said Christina Amestoy, a spokesperson for the Democratic Governors Association.

The notion of abortion access changing by the party in power is driving increased attention to statewide races up and down the ballot, even as control of Congress hangs in the balance of this year’s midterm elections. Meanwhile, GOP officials believe the party has a chance to make inroads with late-deciding voters, particularly as the months pass since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, our colleague Annie Linskey reported yesterday.

What the Michigan midterms mean for the future of abortion

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and activists explain <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Proposal 3,</span> a midterm ballot measure which would enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution. (Video: Hannah Jewell, Lindsey Sitz, Ross Godwin/The Washington Post, Photo: Emily Elconin/The Washington Post)

The landscape: The midterms are less than five weeks away. Voters <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 36 states</span> will choose their governor — <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 20 Republicans</span> <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 16 Democrats</span> holding offices that will be up for election this year.

Groups on both sides of the abortion debate — such as NARAL Pro-Choice America and SBA Pro-Life America — are pouring their resources into governor’s races.

Here are the key contests we’re watching:

Wisconsin: Gov. Tony Evers (D) is in a competitive race against Republican nominee Tim Michels. The state has a pre-Roe ban on the books, which Evers filed a lawsuit to repeal and the state’s Democratic attorney general has said he won’t enforce. However, clinics halted all abortion procedures shortly after the Supreme Court’s ruling.

Michigan: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) is running against Republican challenger Tudor Dixon. Abortion in the state is legal after a state judge invalidated a pre-Roe ban on the procedure. Whitmer has asked the state Supreme Court to strike down the ban as well.

But even if Dixon wins, a Republican-controlled legislature could have a hard time enacting bans on the procedure. That’s because voters will decide whether to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution this November.

Arizona: Katie Hobbs (D) and Kari Lake (R) are fighting to fill this open seat. Earlier this year, Gov. Doug Ducey (R) — who is term-limited — signed legislation banning abortion <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 15 weeks</span>. However, an Arizona judge revived a near-total ban on abortion dating back to the mid-19th century a day before the 15-week limit was set to go into effect.

Pennsylvania: This is another contest with no incumbent. State Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D) and state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R) are fighting to succeed the state’s Democratic governor. Abortions are still legal in the state, but that could change if Mastriano wins and the GOP-controlled legislature sends restrictions on the procedure to his desk.

Georgia: This gubernatorial battle is a redo <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2018.</span> Gov. Brian Kemp (R) is again facing Democrat Stacey Abrams, who has made abortion rights a centerpiece of her campaign. The state has a ban on abortion after fetal cardiac activity, which is at roughly six weeks.

Democrats are working to keep the midterms focused on abortion, believing the issue is a powerful motivator to drive voters to the ballot box. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">However, those efforts are colliding with increased Republican efforts to focus on crime and the economy.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Nationally, recent Google News searches for inflation have been about even with inquiries on abortion.</span> This is the case for battleground states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Georgia, Annie reports.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">* “The moderate and independent voters needed to build winning coalitions in competitive governors races are worried about the economy, crime, and education,” Joanna Rodriguez, a Republican Governors Association spokesperson, said in a statement to The <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Health 202.</span></span></span> The focus on abortion shows to those voters that Democrats “not only don't care about their greatest concerns, but also that they have no plans to address them,” Rodriguez said.,

Here's one interesting figure: Democrats in local, statewide and congressional races across the country have vastly outspent Republicans on advertising on abortion. Since Jan.<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> Democrats have spent <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $236 million</span>. Meanwhile, Republicans have spent <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $62 million</span>, according to AdImpact, which tracks commercials.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Biden administration’s Project Covid Shield hits a snag

The Biden administration’s plan to create a new accelerator for coronavirus vaccines and treatments has hit a standstill, complicated by fading interest among the public and lawmakers alike to continue treating the pandemic as a priority, Politico reports.

</span>Now, senior health officials are raising alarm bells about the nation’s defenses against the rapidly evolving virus without a long-term operation to ensure that its arsenal of tools stay up-to-date with the latest variants.

Key context: The initiative, dubbed Project Covid Shield, was intended to serve as a follow up to Operation Warp Speed, a Trump-era program that doled out federal dollars to private drugmakers to speed up the production of coronavirus vaccines. Officials had hoped to replicate the approach with new candidates to continue developing increasingly advanced shots and therapeutics to fight the virus — all while maintaining the nation’s edge in the global war against covid-19, Politico’s Adam Cancryn and Erin Banco write.

The White House has yet to secure <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $8 billion</span> from Congress it says it needs to get Project Covid Shield off the ground due to a stalemate with Republicans over new coronavirus aid. Meanwhile, even GOP lawmakers open to the concept have categorized the administration’s effort to date as disorganized and vague.

Americans give failing marks to U.S. health-care system

New this a.m.: Nearly half of adults give the country’s health care system a poor or failing grade, according to a new West Health-Gallup poll, which found that Americans across party lines see lobbying and partisan politics as major barriers to finding solutions to address the rising costs of medicine.

By the numbers:

* Sixty-six percent of Americans report their household pays too much relative to the quality of care that it receives, up six points compared with April of last year, according to the poll, which surveyed more <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 5,5000 adults</span>., * <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Six <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 10 Americans</span> report that cost is an important factor when considering a recommended medical procedure or medication., *</span> Half the country — an <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 129 million</span> adults — have low levels of confidence that they can afford health care as they age., * Two in three Americans <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 65 believe</span> Medicare will not exist when they reach the age of eligibility.,

First in The Health 202: Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), a pharmacist, is rolling out a campaign attacking pharmacy benefit managers often known as drug middlemen. In a new 20-page pamphlet, Carter alleges that PBMs use “various tactics to limit patient medication and increase drug costs” and includes interviews with patients.

It’s another salvo in the drug-pricing wars, where PBMs and other industry players spar over who’s driving up the costs. Carter points to various pieces of legislation he wants to see passed, such as a bill he introduced that would ban the use of spread pricing in Medicaid managed care. Spread pricing is when PBMs charge payers more than they pay to the pharmacy and keep the difference.

PBMs hit back. “Americans consistently reject the use of blame game tactics, especially when real patients’ health and lives are at stake,” JC Scott, the president of Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, said in a statement to The <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Health 202.</span></span> “This is especially true when it comes to blaming PBMs, the one entity reducing costs in the health care system,” Scott said.

The outcome is a bonanza for Disney: <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Even as the company limits the number of visitors and keeps attendance at its U.S. theme parks below prepandemic levels, they are generating record sales and profits.

</span>The results reflect a major strategic shift on Disney’s part, where the company is focused less on maximizing the quantity of visitors and more on increasing how much money each visitor spends, an approach the company refers to as yield management. Improving the visitor experience, the thinking goes, will prompt guests to spend more hours—and therefore more money—at the parks because they are having such a good time.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The biggest change in the past two years—and the most lucrative for Disney—is the introduction of a smartphone-app feature called Genie+ that <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">costs $15 per</span> person a day, on top of the price of admission, and allows parkgoers to skip the unreserved lines for some attractions, which the company refers to as “standby.”</span> But Genie+ doesn’t cover everything. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">To skip the standby lines at the most sought-after attractions, including some Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy-themed rides, reservations now cost an <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $10 to</span><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $17.</span></span> Standby waits for popular attractions can last hours.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">At the same time, many benefits that used to be free—from parking for certain annual passholders to airport shuttles to MagicBand wristbands that serve as combination hotel-room keys and park passes—have been eliminated or now come with a price.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Disney has raised prices on hotel rooms, food and merchandise over the past year as inflation has climbed to record levels in the U.S.

Disney’s theme-park pricing is determined by “pure supply and demand,” said a company spokeswoman.</span> “No different than airplanes, hotels or cruise ships.”

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">In the quarter that ended Jan.<span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> Disney’s domestic parks set records in both quarterly revenue and operating income, then broke both of them six months later.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">For the quarter that ended <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2,</span> the business unit that includes the theme parks also posted record revenue <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $5.42 billion</span> and record operating income <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.65 billion</span>.

Josh D’Amaro, the chairman of Disney’s parks, experiences and products division, said that the changes have given visitors more choice about how to spend their time and money at the parks, while at the same time making the parks “extremely commercially successful.”

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">In <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fiscal 2021,</span> the first year that both of Disney’s two main U.S. resorts had reopened following the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, attendance at Disney’s U.S. parks fell <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 17% compared</span> with the previous year, the company reported, but per-capita spending by guests grew <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 17%,</span> or nearly three times the average annual growth rate during the previous decade.</span> Disney doesn’t disclose attendance for its theme parks.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">At the same time, the changes driving the increases in revenue and profit have drawn the ire of what Disney calls “legacy fans,” or longtime parks loyalists, including annual passholders who feel they are being pushed to the side in favor of big-spending families taking once-a-year, or even a once-in-a-lifetime, vacations.

</span>“Disney has this love-hate relationship with annual passholders,” said Len Testa, a computer scientist who runs Touring Plans, a travel company that offers apps to help visitors find deals and navigate their trips to Walt Disney World and publishes a popular guide to Disney theme parks.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">On one hand, they provide a reliable source of revenue—the investment bank UBS estimated early last year that annual passholders at Disneyland account for about one half of annual visits—but on the other, annual passholders tend to spend less than other visitors per visit, Mr. Testa said.

</span>A typical annual pass holder might ride only one ride during a visit, eat an ice cream cone and walk around for a few hours, taking up capacity that might otherwise be used by out-of-state visitors, Mr. Testa said.

“Those people would have stayed all day,” he said. “They would have eaten multiple times in the restaurants, they may have stayed in the hotel. They would definitely be buying more merchandise.”

Since its introduction in the fall <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2021,</span> Genie+ has become an increasingly popular tool. About half of visitors to the parks pay for and use Genie+, Disney said in a recent conference call with Wall Street analysts. And of those who pay for Genie+,<span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 70% say</span> in post-visit surveys that they plan to do so again, Disney says.

Disney has stopped selling nearly all new annual passes to Disneyland and Walt Disney World and has done away with a host of free perks that annual passholders used to enjoy. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Existing annual passholders can renew their passes, although earlier this month, the company raised the renewal price for its highest-tier annual passes to Disneyland <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 14%,</span> <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1,599 from</span><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $1,399,</span> while at the same time introducing more blackout days when passholders can’t visit, angering some of the park’s most ardent fans.

</span>The parks have grown considerably since Walt Disney World opened <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1971.</span> Over the past decade, Disney has added rides based on popular franchises such as Star Wars, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Toy Story films and <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2009 film</span> “Avatar.” A roller coaster at Magic Kingdom based on the Tron films is under construction.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The parks business has buoyed Disney’s stock price and boosted financial results at a time when the company is losing billions on other businesses, like the popular but cost-heavy Disney+ streaming service.

</span>Mr. D’Amaro, the parks chief, is a 24-year veteran of the company who ran both Disneyland and Walt Disney World individually in previous roles.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">He keeps a high profile with fans and employees, making frequent appearances at the parks outside of major events and posting about his visits on social media.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">By contrast, his predecessor, Bob Chapek, who is now Disney’s chief executive, walked the park grounds less frequently and wasn’t as outgoing with visitors, according to Disney employees who worked under him.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">On a recent, hourlong walk through Disneyland, Mr. D’Amaro was stopped more <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20 times</span> by visitors and cast members—as Disney employees are known in company lingo—who asked to take selfies with him and thanked him for his work.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Mr. D’Amaro <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has 144,000 followers</span> on Instagram, where he posts pictures of himself inside the parks alongside costumed employees, riding roller coasters, brandishing lightsabers and eating soft-serve.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Mr. D’Amaro said he’s aware of the tension caused by rising prices and other changes, especially for annual passholders, but describes it as the inevitable result of progress, and insists that every change Disney has implemented at the parks is in service of improving visitors’ trips.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Other top Disney executives say the company is merely reacting to consumer behavior.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">“Demand has not abated” at the parks, Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy told analysts in a conference call in August, explaining why the company wasn’t considering opening up the parks to more days for annual passholders.</span> The new reservation system has allowed the company to limit attendance without having to turn visitors away when the parks become overcrowded, as it occasionally did in previous years.

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">The company also points out that it offers frequent promotions, including discounted room rates at its hotels, packages that become more economical the more days a visitor spends at the park, and discounts for residents of Southern California and Florida.

</span>Other theme-park operators are also reaping the benefits of increased guest spending. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Six Flags Entertainment Corp. and Cedar Fair LP, which operates Cedar Point in Ohio and Knott’s Berry Farm in California, have both raised prices, while SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. implemented <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 5% surcharge</span> on food and beverages.

</span>Sara Suvada, a Starbucks shift supervisor and barista from Auburn Hills, Mich., took her first trip to Walt Disney World in January, at the age <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 42,</span> along with her husband and 6-year-old daughter. She said the trip was the fulfillment of a fantasy from her childhood, when money was tight in her family.

The family spent <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $5,000</span>—most of it paid for by Ms. Suvada’s in-laws—on admission, meals and lodging at Disney’s Saratoga Springs Resort. Ms. Suvada spent <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $400 on</span> souvenirs and concessions, while her husband told her he nearly maxed out his credit card on trinkets and snacks.

<span id=""25"" class=""red"">The memories made up for the price tag, though, she said.</span> She cried when she saw Cinderella Castle for the first time. Her daughter loved riding the Space Mountain roller coaster and meeting her favorite princess, Tiana, from 2009’s “The Princess and the Frog.” And the family savored tasting their first Dole Whip frozen treat. Ms. Suvada is already thinking about returning with her mother.

“The memories are worth more than gold,” she said. “Even if I did suffer from overdraft fees once I got home, when the reality set in.”

Some longtime fans who come to the park regularly, and aren’t splurging on once-in-a-lifetime memories, complain about the new fees.

“I just really resent the nickel-and-diming,” said David Arone, a 50-year-old gym teacher and volleyball coach from Redondo Beach, Calif. Mr. Arone has been a Disneyland annual pass holder for five years, and says he visits the park more <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 times</span> a year, primarily because it reminds him of his best childhood friend, a Disney superfan who died of a heart attack <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013.</span></span>

“I know it sounds hokey, but every time I go, I feel like he’s there with me,” Mr. Arone said of his friend. Most visits, he doesn’t ride any attractions at all. Instead, he just walks around for a few hours, eats ice cream, watches fireworks and reminisces about visiting the park with his late friend.

But he chafes at recent changes. Previously, he could stop by Disneyland for a few hours after work any day he wanted. Now he can’t go on the growing number of blackout days for annual passholders.

<span id=""26"" class=""red"">On a recent visit, Mr. Arone sported a homemade T-shirt with the words “Chapek Killed The Magic” on it — a reference to Mr. Chapek, the CEO, who he blames for rising prices and other changes.

</span>The company said annual passholders like Mr. Arone “are amongst our most special guests.”

<span id=""27"" class=""red"">This month, the company reported that ticket-price increases were offset by an “unfavorable attendance mix” at Disneyland, which many fans interpreted as a reference to annual passholders who typically spend less per visit than individual ticket-buyers.</span> Fans recently started posting pictures of themselves at the parks on social media, wearing T-shirts reading “Unfavorable” in protest.

<span id=""28"" class=""red"">Disney said that “unfavorable mix” is financial parlance meant for investors, and “not a consumer term.”

</span><span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2021,</span> a Disneyland annual pass holder sued Disney, alleging that the company engaged in deceptive practices by artificially limiting how many of them could visit the park on certain days. In May, a U.S. District Court judge in California ruled that the suit could go forward. The plaintiff has said she is seeking class-action certification.

<span id=""29"" class=""red"">Even some customers who come on special annual visits say they are getting fed up with rising prices.

</span>Renea Warren has made the pilgrimage to Walt Disney World nearly every year <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2001.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">But after tallying up the costs of this year’s vacation, the retail executive and mother of one said she has had enough.

</span>On a nine-day family trip to Florida in late July with her mother and daughter, Ms. Warren tried to save money by spending just two days at Disney theme parks, instead of the usual four. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Despite the family’s efforts, visits to Magic Kingdom and Epcot blew up their budget.</span> Park passes set them back more than $800; food was about $200; and they <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped $300 on</span> souvenirs.

Since Ms. Warren, who lives in Benton Harbor, Mich., owns a timeshare <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 minutes</span>’ drive from Walt Disney World, her family will likely return to central Florida next year, but they’ll consider rival attractions at Universal Studios Florida and SeaWorld, she said. Returning to Disney every year is no longer an option.

“Because of the astronomical expenses, I definitely think the magic is being taken away,” she said.

The Genie+ app feature replaced a system known as FastPass that used to come free with any ticket sold at Disneyland or Walt Disney World. The new service—along with a free version, known simply as Genie—does more than make Disney money: It also helps the parks’ operators direct traffic and spread people around the parks more evenly, to reduce waiting times overall, and upsell visitors by offering them promotions on food, merchandise and ride-reservation fees.

Each park has an operation center with a “heat map” that tracks where Genie+ users are in the parks using GPS technology. Park operators can direct traffic using the app by notifying visitors where the shortest lines are and offering food and merchandise promotions to cajole them to other areas.

“If I’m seeing too much activity on the west side, I’m able to spread where I direct people to the east side,” Mr. D’Amaro said. “Our attractions will be load-balanced better, and lines will be shorter, and what that means is the experience will be better.”

<span id=""32"" class=""red"">In an analysis for The Wall Street Journal, Touring Plans analyzed room prices, including taxes, at three popular Walt Disney World hotels over the past decade, and found increases that far outpaced inflation, which in July hit a record high <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 9.1%.</span>

</span>At Pop Century, a “value” hotel at the Orlando resort, the cheapest room rate rose <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $168 this</span> year from $95 <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013.</span></span> At the deluxe Animal Kingdom Lodge, a standard room now costs as much <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $790 a</span> night, versus up <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $486 a</span> decade ago.

<span id=""33"" class=""red"">Prices for tickets and certain food items have also climbed faster than inflation over the past decade, the Touring Plans analysis found.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">Disney fan blogs have noted that classic purchases at Disney parks, including the pineapple Dole Whip frozen treat ($5.99 last year,<span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $6.99 this</span> year at some locations) and studded Mickey Mouse-ears headbands ($29.99 last summer, <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">now $39.99</span>) are quickly getting costlier, outpacing inflation.

</span>In other cases, Disney has curtailed benefits. Guests staying at Disney-owned and certain other hotels at Walt Disney World before Covid could avail themselves of Extra Magic Hours, during which hotel guests could enter certain theme parks early or stay at them later into the night.

Today, Disney offers early entry at all four of its Walt Disney World parks each day to hotel guests, but only <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 30 minutes</span>; before the pandemic, it offered an hour of early admission, but only every other day. Evening extended hours are now only available to visitors staying at the most-expensive “deluxe” tier of hotels.

Disney says some guests prefer the new arrangement.

Mariana Epperson, a 29-year-old mom from Kentucky who works as an account manager for a credit-ratings firm, spent part of her honeymoon at Disneyland, and Walt Disney World is the site of some of her final happy memories with her father, who died a few weeks after she took a trip there with her family in May.

“A lot of people will say, ‘Oh, I can go to Europe for cheaper,’ ” she said. “But Disney now holds the last really good memories of my dad, so for me it’s so important. I can always make more money.”

Even so, this summer, her husband told her he needed a break from the theme parks. They’ve visited Disney resorts six times <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2017,</span> and the parks are getting way too expensive, she said. For their family vacation next year, they are thinking about a Disney cruise. Packages for three-night cruises from San Diego or Miami start at just <span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $1,000.</span> An ocean-view cabin costs more. So do between-meal snacks and excursions ashore.

Which options are worth paying for?

Updated Feb.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 22,</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 12</span>:01 am ET

Amir and Mojgan Moghadam <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $1.4 million</span> on their new home in Irvine, Calif. But to make it absolutely perfect, they spent a <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">further $550,000 on</span> builder upgrades—<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including $28,200 for</span> a conservatory,<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $2,600 for</span> a Sub-Zero ice maker <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $495 for</span> five exterior wall-light outlets.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Buying a newly built home is a lot like buying a new car at the dealership—optional features cost extra.</span> Buyers will pay more for premium granite, a fancier fridge or an epoxy-coated garage floor. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">And upgrades can be a lucrative part of a builder's business, with profit margins as high <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 60%,</span> depending on the option, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting.

</span>Indeed, buyers like the Moghadams are helping builders return to profitability after a long downturn. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">During the housing boom, homes were loaded with expensive features, and buyers snapped them up, regardless of price.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">These days, however, upscale buyers are choosier, selecting pricey options that are within their budgets and still practical for the resale market.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">An <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 10% to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30% of</span> a home's base price is spent on upgrades.</span> And companies say these optional features have been spurring growth in high-end home construction.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Record-low interest rates are driving much of this spending, with a 30-year, fixed-rate average <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3.68% for</span> conforming loans, which are <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $417,000 in</span> most markets, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 4.13% for</span> larger loans, according to HSH.com, a mortgage-research website.</span> Monica Kaiser, for instance, added <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $70,000 worth</span> of upgrades to <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $1 million</span>-plus San Diego home she and her husband purchased in December. The Kaisers decided to spend the money now—instead of later—for the upgrades they wanted. The Kaisers opted for <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $10,000 staircase</span> with wrought-iron balusters and <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $4,500 for</span> tile and stonework in the home's 41⁄2 bathrooms, along with other features from builder Standard Pacific.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">""With interest rates so low, you're not going to be able to get what you want any cheaper at any time,"" says Ms. Kaiser, a mother of three who works for local media outlet.</span> ""To put a lot of these upgrades in down the line would have just been silly, because we'd be paying more to take out a loan or dipping into other assets.""

Some builders present buyers with thousands of choices that let them build a near-custom home that won't resemble anything else in their community. Customizing a home can make a customer less likely to cancel the deal. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">""They're emotionally attached to what they have designed,"" says Joan Marcus-Colvin, senior vice president of sales, marketing and design for the New Home Co.</span> ""They have actually pictured themselves living in that surrounding.""

To this end, builders construct lavish model homes to showcase the full range of options. Toll Brothers, a luxury builder based in Horsham, Pa., is known for models that ""pretty much upgrade everything,"" says Denise DiBlasio, who manages Toll's design studio in Bucks County, Pa. Toll will put a fireplace in the master bath or a wine grotto in the basement.

In North Palm Beach, Fla., Toll poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into upgrades for the model home at its upscale Frenchman's Harbor community, where single-family homes start <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $1.7 million</span>. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The company says it is not unusual for a buyer to replicate the model or to copy the kitchen, regardless of cost.

</span>Toll, like many other builders, has bricks-and-mortar design centers stocked with samples of everything from carpet colors to granite slabs that customers can touch and coordinate with other items. Interior-design specialists are on hand to guide buyers on what's hot and help them avoid design disasters.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">The New Home Co., a three-year-old upscale builder in California with starting prices as high <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $2 million</span>, took <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in $9 million</span> from its design studios <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> up <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $7.6 million</span> the prior year.

</span>Publicly traded builders, who sell more homes but generally don't disclose profits from upgrades, can rake in much more. Jeffrey Burnett estimates he and his wife spent three full days at Toll's Boca Raton, Fla., design center, one <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 15 nationwide</span>, selecting extras for <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his $2.5 million</span> home under construction in Frenchman's Harbor. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">In the end, Mr. Burnett, chief executive officer of Labor Finders International, a nationwide blue-collar staffing company based in Palm Beach Gardens, <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">added $800,000 worth</span> of upgrades, including <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $100,000 tennis</span> court and a steam room.

</span>In the past decade, builders have increasingly been allowing buyers to pick favorite items through a website or app. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Buyers can almost think of it like a game: They choose options to build their dream homes, then add or delete items as the budget permits.

</span>""It was like I was going to the store,"" says Ms. Moghadam, the Irvine, Calif., buyer of the New Home Co. house. ""I would sit on my iPad and I would just pick out all the options I liked: cabinets, sinks, hardware, faucets. You could just do it at home and have fun with it.""

The most money is usually spent on kitchens, bathrooms and flooring, according to BDX, the marketing-services and technology company behind the Envision online design center that helps customers select options. Buyers upgrade <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">flooring 73% of</span> the time, <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cabinets 70% and</span> <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">appliances 63%,</span> the company says.

In the kitchen, large, granite-topped islands that seat four to eight people are popular, as are supersize showers with sitting space, says Jeffrey Lake, Standard Pacific's national head of architecture.

Northeasterners like crown molding and wainscoting, while Florida buyers often spring for a screened-in lanai and a bathroom specifically for the pool area. On the West Coast, consumers are more likely to add large glass doors that can be opened to seamlessly combine the family living space with the outdoors, he said.

Builders warn buyers to keep an eye on spending to avoid appraisal woes. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">An extensively upgraded home could appear overvalued when compared with recent nearby sales.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">If that happens, the builder may have to cut the price or ask the buyer for extra money at the closing.</span> For that reason—and to help pay for the purchase and installation of the upgrade—some builders require upgrade deposits in advance. The Moghadams, whose purchase contract for extras <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">covered 32 pages</span>, paid <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 50% of</span> their upgrades upfront, though that was spread across multiple payments.

<span id=""14"" class=""red"">M.D.C. Holdings, a builder that operates under the Richmond American Homes name, may ask for an additional deposit if a buyer's interior-design upgrades <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">exceed 13% of</span> the base price.</span> Typically, the additional deposit <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 50% of</span> the amount spent <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 13%.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Above 18%,</span> the buyer may have to place a deposit equal <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 100% of</span> additional upgrades. The company may also ask buyers to pay for unusual choices upfront. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">""If you order the pink carpet, we're probably going to ask you to put the full deposit on that one,"" says Bob Martin, the Denver-based builder's vice president of finance and business development who is currently picking out upgrades for his new home.</span> ""Nothing against pink,"" he adds.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">And, given consumer demand, more builders are making some upscale features—things like granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances—standard, even in lower-priced homes.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Some builders, like Miami-based Lennar, purchase popular options in bulk at a discount and include them in the home's base price.</span> This approach appeals to buyers who don't want to make many decisions or feel nickel-and-dimed when opting for an upgrade like an extra electrical outlet.

One upgrade tends to hold its value: land. Former NFL player Michael Hamilton decided to build a new Standard Pacific home in San Diego after seeing a roughly half-acre lot with views of coastal sage shrub and other native plants <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">near 1,600 acres</span> of preserved open space.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">Premium lots in the upscale Bellasario at Stonebridge Estates community cost up <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $215,000 above</span> the neighborhood'<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $900,000 base</span> price.</span> The upgraded lot gave Mr. Hamilton room for another upgrade, <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $100,000 backyard</span> cottage for guests. ""I wanted that lot and I wanted the casita,"" he said, adding that ""I wish I would have gotten a couple more upgrades.""

66861d24a5f104da3398a8ea,21067,"<h3>Looking to themselves, Palestinians expect little from Israeli changes.</h3>Wide-Ranging Israel Coalition Reaches Deal to Form Government
Negotiating as the clock ran down, Israeli parties ranging from the left to the far right, including an Arab bloc, agreed on a coalition government.
This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the Israeli election and its aftermath here.
JERUSALEM — Israeli opposition parties on Wednesday reached a coalition agreement to form a government and oust Benjamin Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history and a dominant figure who has pushed his nation’s politics to the right.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The announcement by the parties could lead to the easing of a political impasse that has produced four elections in two years and left Israel without a stable government or a state budget.</span> If Parliament ratifies the fragile agreement in a confidence vote in the coming days, it will also bring down the curtain, if only for an intermission, on the premiership of a leader who has defined contemporary Israel more than any other.
The new coalition is an unusual and awkward alliance between eight political parties from a diverse array of ideologies, from the left to the far right. It includes the membership of a small Arab party called Raam, which would become the first Arab group to join a right-leaning coalition in Israeli history.
While some analysts have hailed the coalition as reflecting the breadth and complexity of contemporary society, others say its members are too incompatible for their compact to last, and consider it the embodiment of Israel’s political dysfunction.
The alliance would be led <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2023 by</span> Naftali Bennett, a religiously observant former settler leader who opposes a Palestinian state and wants Israel to annex the majority of the occupied West Bank. He is a former ally of Mr. Netanyahu often described as more right-wing than the prime minister.
If the government lasts a whole term, it would then be led <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2023 and</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2025 by</span> Yair Lapid, a centrist former television host considered a standard-bearer for secular Israelis.
The son of American immigrants, Mr. Bennett,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 49,</span></span> is a former software entrepreneur, army commando, chief of staff to Mr. Netanyahu and defense minister. His home is in central Israel, but he was once chief executive of an umbrella group, the Yesha Council, that represents Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. Until the most recent election cycle, Mr. Bennett was part of a political alliance with Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right leader.
Though Mr. Bennett’s party, Yamina, won just seven of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 120 seats</span></span> in Parliament, the anti-Netanyahu forces could not form a government without his support, allowing him to set the terms of his involvement in the coalition.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Mr. Lapid,<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 57,</span> is a former news anchor and journalist who became a politician nine years ago and later served as finance minister in a Netanyahu-led coalition.</span> His party placed second in the general election in March, <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">winning 17 seats</span>. But Mr. Lapid considered the ouster of Mr. Netanyahu more important than demanding to go first as prime minister.
Yair Lapid, the leader of the Israeli opposition, had until midnight on Wednesday to cobble together an unlikely coalition to topple Benjamin Netanyahu. He needed almost every minute — leaving it until 11:22 p.m. to inform Reuven Rivlin, Israel’s largely ceremonial president, that he had assembled an eight-party alliance.
“The government will do everything it can to unite every part of Israeli society,” Mr. Lapid said in a statement released shortly after his call with Mr. Rivlin.
Mr. Lapid’s celebrations will be put on hold for several days, however. The speaker of the Israeli Parliament, Yariv Levin, is a member of Mr. Netanyahu’s party, Likud, and can use parliamentary procedure to delay the confidence vote until Monday, <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 14,</span> constitutional experts said.
In the meantime, Mr. Netanyahu’s party has promised to pile pressure on wavering members of Mr. Lapid’s fragile coalition, formed of hard-right parties, leftists, centrists and Arab Islamists, in a bid to persuade them to abandon the coalition. Many of them already feel uncomfortable about working with each other, and have made difficult compromises to join forces in order to push Mr. Netanyahu from office.
Mr. Lapid himself agreed to give Naftali Bennett, a hard-right former settler leader who opposes Palestinian statehood, the chance to lead the government <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2023,</span> at which point Mr. Lapid will take over.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">In a sign of the friction to come, Raam, the Arab Islamist party, announced that it had joined the coalition after receiving assurances about improvements to the Arab minority’s land and housing rights that many hard-right Israelis deem unacceptable, including the regularization of three illegally constructed Arab towns in the Negev desert.
</span>An hour before the deal was announced, one hard-right lawmaker, Nir Orbach, whose party colleagues say he has been particularly unsure about joining the coalition, tweeted: “We are not abandoning the Negev. Period.”
The fact that these tensions were on full display even before the coalition was officially formed has left many Israelis wondering whether it will last more than a few months, let alone its full term.
Should the coalition collapse, analysts believe Mr. Lapid may emerge with more credit than Mr. Bennett. While Mr. Bennett gets first crack at the premiership, his decision to work with centrists and leftists has angered his already small following.
“Lapid has made a very strong set of decisions, conveyed an amazing level of maturity and really made a big statement about a different kind of leadership,” said Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli political analyst and pollster at the Century Foundation, a New York-based research group. “That will not be lost on the Israeli public.”

Now that opposition parties have reached agreement on a coalition government, it has up to seven days to present the government to Parliament for a vote of confidence.
Some disagreements within the fractious coalition were still being ironed out until shortly before the deadline on Wednesday, at midnight in Israel.
And with the fate of the new coalition dependent on a narrow margin and hanging on every single vote, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies were on the hunt for potential defectors leading up to the announcement, and signaled that they would continue until the vote of confidence.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Israel has held four parliamentary elections in two years, all of them inconclusive, leaving it without a stable government or state budget.</span> If the opposition fails to form a government, it could lead to yet another election.
Naftali Bennett, who is poised to become Israel’s next prime minister, is a former high-tech entrepreneur best known for insisting that there must never be a full-fledged Palestinian state and that Israel should annex much of the occupied West Bank.
The independently wealthy son of immigrants from the United States, Mr. Bennett,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 49,</span></span> first entered the Israeli Parliament eight years ago and is relatively unknown and inexperienced on the international stage. That has left much of the world — and many Israelis — wondering what kind of leader he might be.
A former chief of staff to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, Mr. Bennett is often described as more right-wing than his old boss. Shifting between seemingly contradictory alliances, Mr. Bennett has been called an extremist and an opportunist. Allies say he is merely a pragmatist, less ideological than he appears, and lacking Mr. Netanyahu’s penchant for demonizing opponents.
In a measure of Mr. Bennett’s talents, he has now pulled off a feat that is extraordinary even by the perplexing standards of Israeli politics. He has all but maneuvered himself into the top office even though his party, Yamina, won just seven of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 120 seats</span></span> in the Parliament.
Mr. Bennett leveraged his modest but pivotal electoral weight after the inconclusive March election, Israel’s fourth in two years. He entered coalition talks as a kingmaker, and appears ready to emerge as the one wearing the crown.
Mr. Bennett has long championed West Bank settlers and once led the council representing them, though he is not a settler, himself. He is religiously observant — he would be the first prime minister to wear a kipa — but he will head a governing coalition that is largely secular.
He would lead a precarious coalition that spans Israel’s fractious political spectrum from left to right, and includes a small Arab, Islamist party — much of which opposes his ideas on settlement and annexation. That coalition proposes to paper over its differences on Israeli-Palestinian relations by focusing on domestic matters.
Mr. Bennett has explained his motives for teaming up with such ideological opposites as an act of last resort to end the political impasse that has paralyzed Israel.
“The political crisis in Israel is unprecedented on a global level,” he said in a televised speech on Sunday. “We could end up with fifth, sixth, even 10th elections, dismantling the walls of the country, brick by brick, until our house falls in on us. Or we can stop the madness and take responsibility.”
One of the most unlikely kingmakers involved in the formation of a new government is Mansour Abbas, the leader of the small Arab party known by its Hebrew acronym, Raam, with four seats in the current Parliament.
Under an 11th-hour deal, Raam formally agreed to join a Lapid-Bennett coalition government, though it would not hold any Cabinet seats. That was something of a surprise, as the party was expected to remain outside the coalition, while supporting it in a confidence vote in the Parliament. Some Arab lawmakers played a similar role by supporting Yitzhak Rabin’s government from the outside in the 1990s.
For decades, Arab parties have not been directly involved in Israeli governments. They have been mostly shunned by other parties, and are leery of joining a government that oversees occupation of the Palestinian territories and Israel’s military actions.
But after decades of political marginalization, many Palestinian citizens, who make up a fifth of Israel’s population, have been seeking fuller integration.
Israel’s early, leftist governments included Arab parties that were closely affiliated with the mostly Jewish parties. Raam would be the first independent Arab party in government, and the first Arab party of any kind in a right-leaning government.
Raam has been willing to work with both the pro- and anti-Netanyahu camps since the March election and to use its leverage to wrest concessions for the Arab public. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The party has refused to commit to a deal unless it gets assurances for greater resources and rights for Israel’s Arab minority, including reforms to housing legislation that potential hard-right coalition partners do not accept.

Sitting in her office in Parliament on Wednesday afternoon, Idit Silman, a hard-right lawmaker, flicked through hundreds of recent text messages from unknown numbers.
Some were laced with abusive language. Some warned she was going to hell. All of them demanded that her party abandon coalition negotiations with an alliance of centrist, leftist and right-wing lawmakers seeking to replace Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 12 years</span>.
“It’s very hard,” Ms. Silman said. “People would rather put pressure on Idit Silman than see Benjamin Netanyahu leave Balfour Street,” she added, in a reference to the location of the prime minister’s official residence.
As opposition negotiators race to meet a midnight deadline to agree on a new government, supporters of Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud party were working overtime to pressure Ms. Silman and other members of the right-wing Yamina party.
Many right-wing Israelis see Yamina’s turn against Mr. Netanyahu as a betrayal.
This onslaught gave Ms. Silman and her colleagues pause for thought — and an incentive to be seen as prolonging the negotiations for as long as possible. Though Yamina did finally join the coalition on Wednesday night, Mr. Netanyahu’s party, Likud, is likely to continue to play on these fears.
Parliament might not hold a vote of confidence in a new government for <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another 10 days</span>, giving Mr. Netanyahu more time to persuade Yamina lawmakers to reverse course.
His party has already promised to keep goading Ms. Silman and her colleagues.
“Behind the scenes,” said a senior Likud official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, “the Likud party is ramping up the pressure, particularly on the weakest links.”
The pressure has been relentless for days, since the phone numbers of Ms. Silman and her colleagues, they say, were posted on several WhatsApp and Facebook groups. That has prompted a barrage of messages — and not just from Israelis. Evangelical pastors in the United States have weighed in, and so have Hasidic activists in Britain, among many others.
The Likud party denies accusations that it posted any numbers publicly.
When Ms. Silman turned up at her local synagogue last week, she found several slick posters outside, each with her portrait overlaid with the slogan: “Idit Silman stitched together a government with terror supporters.”
For days, protesters have picketed her home, shouted abuse at her children, and trailed her by car in a menacing fashion, she said.
Yamina’s leader, Naftali Bennett, decided to negotiate with the opposition on Sunday night, after months of wavering. His calculus was based on realism, analysts say: Mr. Netanyahu cannot form a coalition, even with Mr. Bennett’s support. So Mr. Bennett can either fall in with the opposition, who have offered him the chance to be prime minister — or force the country to a fifth election in little more than two years.
“We always ask ourselves this question,” Ms. Silman said on Wednesday afternoon. “Is it right? Can we do something else?”

Naftali Bennett, who leads a small right-wing party, and Yair Lapid, the centrist leader of the Israeli opposition, have joined forces to try to form a diverse coalition to unseat Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister.
Spanning Israel’s fractious political spectrum from left to right, and relying on the support of a small Arab, Islamist party, the proposed coalition, dubbed the “change government” by supporters, could signal a profound shift for Israel. Its leaders have pledged to end the cycle of divisive politics and inconclusive elections.
The opposition parties announced a coalition agreement on Wednesday. But even if they survive a vote of confidence in the Parliament and form a government, toppling Mr. Netanyahu, how much change would their “change government” bring, when some of the parties agree on little else besides antipathy for Israel’s longest-serving leader?
Mr. Bennett, whose party won seven seats in Parliament, is often described as further to the right than Mr. Netanyahu. While Mr. Netanyahu eroded the idea of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr. Bennett, a religiously observant champion of Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, openly rejects the concept of a sovereign Palestinian state and has advocated annexing West Bank territory.
Still, though the coalition will include several parties that disagree on both those issues, they have agreed to allow Mr. Bennett to become prime minister first.
If the coalition deal holds, Mr. Bennett would be replaced for the second part of the four-year term by Mr. Lapid, who advocates for secular, middle-class Israelis and whose party <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">won 17 seats</span>.
By conceding the first turn in the rotation, Mr. Lapid, who has been branded as a dangerous leftist by his opponents on the right, smoothed the way for other right-wing politicians to join the new anti-Netanyahu alliance.
In a measure of the plot twists and tumult behind this political turnaround, Mr. Bennett had pledged before the election not to enable a Lapid government of any kind or any government reliant on the Islamist party, called Raam.
The coalition would stand or fall on the cooperation between eight parties with disparate ideologies and, on many issues, clashing agendas.
In a televised address on Sunday night, Mr. Bennett said he was committed to fostering national unity.
“Two thousand years ago, there was a Jewish state which fell here because of internal quarrels,” he said. “This will not happen again. Not on my watch.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Even as the country and its Parliament remained deeply divided over the formation of a new government, Israeli lawmakers came together on Wednesday to elect a new president, Isaac Herzog, a former leader of the Labor party and government minister.
</span>Displaying a rare degree of consensus in a secret ballot, they voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Herzog, who currently serves as the chairman of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency for Israel, which helps deal with immigration, interacts with the Jewish diaspora and runs social programs.
The president plays a mostly symbolic role as a national unifier in Israel’s fractious parliamentary democracy, where the prime minister wields the most power.
One of a president’s main responsibilities is to grant a candidate the task of forming a government after elections. In Israel’s current, fragmented politics, which have produced four inconclusive elections in two years, that involves more than the usual level of skill, legal interpretation and discretion.
The president can also play an important role in Israeli diplomacy and has the power to pardon convicted criminals and exercise clemency by reducing or commuting sentences.

Less than a month ago, an eruption of intense fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip plunged Israeli and Palestinian communities into chaos. As the civilian casualties grew, overwhelmingly on the Gaza side, the conflict polarized Israeli society, and the world, in ways seldom seen before.
At <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 230 people</span> were killed in Gaza during the war, including at <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 65 children</span>, while in Israel at <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 12 were</span> killed, including two children. Gaza’s infrastructure, already ailing, was gutted by Israeli airstrikes on the densely populated territory. And Israeli towns and cities within range of Hamas rockets went into repeated, frightening lockdowns in shelters.
The war also spurred unrest within Israel and the occupied territories that has been more explosive than any in years. It has inspired a new era of Palestinian activism, and has shifted the ground politically, coloring the drama that was playing out in Israel on Wednesday.
Here is what to know about the 11-day war, and its lasting effects.
JERUSALEM — For Israelis, the possible downfall of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the country’s longest-serving leader, is an epochal moment. Israeli media have barraged their audiences with reports and commentary on the opposition attempts to form a government.
But for many Palestinians, the political drama has prompted little more than a shrug and a resurgence of bitter memories.
During Mr. Netanyahu’s current 12-year tenure, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process fizzled, as Israeli and Palestinian leaders accused each other of obstructing the process, and Mr. Netanyahu expressed increasing skepticism about the possibility of a sovereign Palestinian state.
But to many Palestinians, his likely replacement as prime minister, Naftali Bennett, would be no improvement. Mr. Bennett is Mr. Netanyahu’s former chief of staff, and a former settler leader who outright rejects Palestinian statehood.
Instead, many Palestinians are consumed by their own political moment, which some activists have framed as the most pivotal in decades.
The Palestinian polity has long been physically and politically fragmented between the American-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank; its archrival, Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza; a Palestinian minority inside Israel whose votes might make or break an Israeli government; and a sprawling diaspora.
But spurred by last month’s 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and the worst bout of intercommunal Arab-Jewish violence to have convulsed Israel in decades, these disparate parts suddenly came together in a seemingly leaderless eruption of shared identity and purpose.
In a rare display of unity, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians observed a general strike on <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 12 across</span> Gaza, the West Bank, the refugee camps of Lebanon and inside Israel itself.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“I don’t think whoever is in charge in Israel will make a great deal of difference to the Palestinians,” said Ahmad Aweidah, the former head of the Palestinian stock exchange.</span> “There might be slight differences and nuances, but all mainstream Israeli parties, with slight exceptions on the extreme left, share pretty much the same ideology.”
The strike in mid-May, Mr. Aweidah said, “showed that we are united no matter what the Israelis have tried to do <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 73 years</span>: categorizing us into Israeli Arabs, West Bankers, Jerusalemites, Gazans, refugees and diaspora.”

May’s increase was driven in part by sharp rises in the prices for energy, which <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 34.6% from</span> a year earlier, and groceries, which <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">jumped 11.9% on</span> the year, the biggest increase <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1979.</span></span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">But inflation pressures were distinctly broad-based in May, said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.

</span>“Given everything from the implications of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Chinese lockdowns and just the sheer appetite for travel...what we’ve seen is the perfect storm of those factors hitting, along with some major refinery closures,” she said. “Inflationary pressures were seen nearly everywhere.”

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The inflation news hit stock and bond prices, with investors’ fearing the Federal Reserve could be forced to act more aggressively to tame surging price increases.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Prices for used cars and trucks—a key engine of the past year’s inflation surge—<span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 1.8% in</span> May from April, reversing three months of declines.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Shelter costs, an indicator of broad inflation pressures, accelerated on a monthly basis in May and were <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 5.5%,</span> compared with a year ago.

</span>Airline fares <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 12.6% on</span> the month, the third straight double-digit rise.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">“We suspect that the formidable momentum in inflation could push the headline rate for CPI close <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 9% as</span> early as next month,” said Ms. House, adding that it is likely to stay near those levels through the autumn.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">The May inflation figures came as consumer sentiment soured further on the economy.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The preliminary estimate of the consumer sentiment index published Friday by the University of Michigan fell <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 50.2 in</span> June <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 58.4 in</span> May, marking its lowest reading on record.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Nearly half of those surveyed attributed their negative views to inflation, up <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 38% the</span> prior month, and long-term inflation expectations rose to the highest level <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span>

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">High inflation is a downside of strong U.S. growth, fueled in part by low interest rates and government stimulus to counter the Covid-19 pandemic’s impact.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The annual rate of inflation has risen sharply since <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2021,</span> when the U.S. economy’s rebound from the pandemic accelerated, leading to supply disruptions and other imbalances that put upward pressure on prices for longer than policy makers anticipated.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">The Fed faces the difficult task of tightening monetary policy enough to cool the economy and calm inflation, while avoiding a recession.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Fed officials on <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 4 lifted</span> rates by a half-percentage point and will meet again next week to consider a similar increase.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">Economists and policy makers had been watching closely for signs that inflationary pressures are ebbing.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">But May’s resurgence in price increases ratchets up pressure on the Fed to raise rates aggressively to tame inflation, said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">“The breadth of inflation pressures in the economy should alarm the Fed,” he said.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">On a monthly basis, the CPI jumped a seasonally <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">adjusted 1% in</span> May after <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rising 0.3% in</span> the prior month.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">The so-called core-price index, which excludes the often volatile categories of food and energy, <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">increased 0.6% on</span> the month, the same as in April.</span> That compares with an average monthly gain <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 0.2% for</span> both measures in the two years before the pandemic.

<span id=""22"" class=""red"">On a 12-month basis, the core-price index <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">increased 6% in</span> May, down <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 6.2% in</span> April.</span> March’<span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 6.5% rise</span> was the highest rate since <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">August 1982.</span>

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Inflation was highest in the South, <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 9.2%,</span> and the Midwest, where prices <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 8.8%.</span></span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Residents of the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater area of Florida swallowed <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">an 11.3% increase</span> over <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 12 months</span> ended in May, driven in part by a sharp rise in rental prices.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Inflation was <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 6.3% in</span> the New York City metropolitan area, due in part to relatively low rental-price gains.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">“I understand inflation is a real challenge to American families,” said President Biden, speaking at the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, Calif.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">He added the administration would do “everything we can to lower prices for the American people and Congress has to act,” and cited efforts to reduce backlogs of supplies at U.S. ports.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Energy prices rose in May as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continued to push up prices for crude-oil and natural gas.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">Gasoline prices have breached record levels in recent weeks.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">The average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gas in the U.S. <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">hit $5 Friday</span> night, according to OPIS, an energy-data and analytics provider.

</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">The strength in energy price rises will keep putting upward pressure on inflation, said Ms. House, the Wells Fargo economist.

</span>Consumers’ grocery bills have risen by an annual rate of more <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10% since</span> earlier this year, a pace last seen in the early 1980s. <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Food price increases are unusually broad, and every single grocery category measured in the report rose in May from a year ago—most of them by double digits.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">There are numerous causes, unlike early in the pandemic when meat prices drove much of the increase, said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.

</span>“It’s not just the weather—it’s diseases affecting citrus trees and chickens. <span id=""34"" class=""red"">It’s the Ukraine conflict,” which has affected prices for baked goods and cereals, he said.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">Drought, too, is hitting prices for vegetables and other crops.

</span>“For people on lower incomes, this is not discretionary spending,” Mr. Ashworth said. “Other than substituting out cheaper food types—cheaper meat cuts, whatever it might be—people need to continue buying food.”

<span id=""36"" class=""red"">Price pressures are strong across much of the economy in part because of an unusually tight U.S. labor market, with demand for workers outstripping supply.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">Employers <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">added 390,000 jobs</span> last month, and the unemployment rate hovered near a half-century low.</span> <span id=""38"" class=""red"">Still, even after the economy gained more <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 6.5 million</span> jobs in the space of a year, fewer Americans are employed as a share of the population than before the pandemic.

</span><span id=""39"" class=""red"">Those dynamics are driving wage growth, adding to inflationary pressures.</span> <span id=""40"" class=""red"">Strong gains in wages and hiring are pumping more money into Americans’ bank accounts, propping up demand as inflation erodes spending power for many.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, higher labor costs stemming from worker shortages are prompting many employers to raise prices.

</span><span id=""42"" class=""red"">Demand for travel and other services has surged as the impact of Covid-19 recedes and people spend more freely on experiences they missed out on during the worst of the pandemic.</span> <span id=""43"" class=""red"">This is pushing up prices for these services.</span> <span id=""44"" class=""red"">Airline fares <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">surged 37.8% from</span> a year ago, while hotel prices <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 19.3% higher</span>.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">Restaurant prices <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 7.4%,</span> the sharpest rise <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1981.</span>

</span><span id=""46"" class=""red"">Despite strong demand for summer activities such as travel, higher prices are eating into many business owners’ profitability.</span> In <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2020,</span> Suzanne Hoffman, an author who runs wine tours in Italy, canceled group tours to Piedmont because of the pandemic. A number of guests rolled over their deposits and are finally taking their trips this summer.

<span id=""47"" class=""red"">“The demand is there; people are just champing at the bit,” said Ms. Hoffman, who is based in Edwards, Colo.

</span><span id=""48"" class=""red"">But the people taking those long-delayed trips are <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paying 2019 prices</span>, she said, while fuel, dining and other costs to conduct the tours have gone up.</span> That is hurting Ms. Hoffman’s bottom line to the extent that she might stop running future tours given the uncertain outlook.

“I canceled my October tour. I just don’t want to make any commitments beyond this summer,” she said.

<span id=""49"" class=""red"">Some main drivers of inflation could be easing.

</span><span id=""50"" class=""red"">The backlog in cargo ships waiting to unload in Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., fell for the fourth straight month in May, said Oren Klachkin of Oxford Economics.</span> Target Corp. recently said the need to unload unwanted goods would cause its profit to drop. Clothes retailers have also been caught with swelling inventories of casual clothes and home items as shoppers scaled back spending on goods that had been popular throughout the pandemic.

<span id=""51"" class=""red"">But supply bottlenecks are easing too slowly and too sporadically to ease inflationary pressures, economists say.</span> <span id=""52"" class=""red"">Energy disruptions caused by the Ukraine war and the lack of workers to fill vacancies in the U.S. are exacerbating strains on the economy’s ability to meet demand without price rises.

</span><span id=""53"" class=""red"">The breadth and persistence of these supply problems means that for inflation to ease, demand must come down, said Mr. Knightley of ING.</span> <span id=""54"" class=""red"">“To get demand into better balance with the supply the onus is on the Federal Reserve to do the heavy lifting,” he said.

Dec.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 11</span>:00 pm ET

NINGDE, China—The price of nickel, a metal used to make stainless steel for everything from sauce pans to guitar strings, spiked <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past $50,000 a</span> metric ton <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007 from</span> less <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $10,000 just</span> a few years earlier.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">With nickel largely controlled by Western companies, China's swelling economy was especially vulnerable—until some of its steel producers figured out how to substitute a lower-grade ""nickel pig iron,"" unlocking a mother lode of cheap supply.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The innovation has sent nickel prices tumbling to less <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $14,000 a</span> metric ton, and turned China into a leading nickel producer.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The country now turns out more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 400,000 metric</span> tons of nickel pig iron a year, equal to a fifth of world-wide demand.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Economists for years warned that rising demand for natural resources by China and other emerging markets would outstrip supply, leaving the world short of everything from nickel to coal, copper and corn.

</span>But a remarkable period of innovation and investment has produced a far different picture. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Expanded supply has helped moderate commodity prices over the past year after a decade of demand from China helped push many prices into the stratosphere.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The International Monetary Fund's index of all commodity prices is down <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 12% from</span> recent peaks; it had roughly tripled <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Between 2000 and</span></span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2011.</span></span> Copper is <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 28% from</span> its record high <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span> while thermal coal has fallen by more than half since <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2008 peak</span>.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Of course, price declines are also driven by weaker demand, especially in China, where economic growth has slowed.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">And prices for many commodities, including oil, remain far above their average <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 10 or</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 15 years</span> ago.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">But the global supply picture is the best in years.</span> ""It's kind of basic econ 101: Scarcity induces some sort of innovation,"" said David Jacks, an associate professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who has studied commodity cycles over the past century.

The most widely known innovation is the oil-field technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which fueled the shale boom by injecting water and other materials into the earth to unlock oil and natural gas.

But in agriculture, farmers are tapping new patches of arable land, and turning to higher-yielding hybrid seeds.

In the mining industry, drilling companies are using diamond-coated drill bits to reach miles farther beneath the earth's surface. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">They also employ aircraft radar to map the geology of remote areas.</span> Firms that mix chemicals into minerals to make desired metals rise to the top or sink to the bottom now extract more product than ever from lower-grade deposits.

On top of all that, many projects that were funded years ago—including new or expanded copper, silver and nickel mines—have started producing.

As as result, mine production has nearly doubled or tripled for every major metal over the past two decades, according to the U.S. Geological Survey and other organizations.

<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Between 2000 and</span></span><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012,</span> aluminum output increased <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 45.7 million</span> metric tons <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 24.7 million</span>, according to the Raw Materials Group Stockholm, a consultancy. Production of iron ore, used in steelmaking, hit two billion metric tons from <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 975 million</span> over the same period.

Global production of corn, meanwhile, rose by <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 270 million</span> metric tons over the past decade, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. That growth was the biggest 10-year increase on record and more than triple the gains of the previous decade.

Output of palm oil, used in cookies and instant noodles, has more than doubled since the start of the last decade, and so has the harvest of walnuts and almonds.

All this expanded production has often come with environmental costs, which in various places include air pollution, clear-cut forests and water tainted by chemicals.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">And it remains unclear how the world can sustain the commodity-production gains still needed to meet future demand.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Per capita consumption of energy and other resources in China remains lower than in the West, which means more production increases will be needed in the future as the Chinese economy grows.</span> Many easy-to-reach minerals have been exhausted, likely raising future production costs.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">But innovations of the past decade show how market signals help unlock new supply.</span> The period compares with advances in copper production during the 1920s, Mr. Jacks said. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">And demand during World War II led to the expansion of synthetic rubber production.

</span>Minerals companies, for example, have improved the chemical process to extract raw materials from waste rock. Rio Tinto in Utah extracts silver, gold and molybdenum from the muddy sludge that is a byproduct of mining copper. In Minnesota, a company called Magnetation Inc. has developed machines that use magnets to extract iron ore from mining waste.

China's nickel production is one of the most dramatic examples of fresh thinking. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">In the early 2000s, prices were <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $10,000 per</span> metric ton.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Then China's economy took off, along with new demand for stainless steel, which requires nickel and iron.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Nickel prices <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">surpassed $51,000 per</span> ton in mid-2007.

</span>Chinese stainless steel producers were furious, especially since much of the world's nickel supplies were dominated by such foreign companies as BHP Billiton Ltd., Vale SA of Brazil, and Russia's MMC Norilsk Nickel.

Most nickel production at the time came from so-called sulfide deposits in places like Canada and Russia, where mines were being depleted.

There were plenty of lower-grade laterite deposits in Indonesia and elsewhere. It could be refined into nickel pig iron, which contains a relatively small portion of nickel—usually less than 15%—mixed with iron. But processing the laterite ore required lots of energy and created lots of pollution.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">Analysts figured it <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cost $20,000 or</span> more per metric ton to make nickel pig iron, more than double the market price for nickel in the early 2000s.</span> Mining companies often tossed laterite nickel aside.

<span id=""19"" class=""red"">But when nickel prices climbed, China saw a competitive advantage: it still had scores of old, inefficient blast furnaces.</span> Beijing had been pressing steelmakers to shut them down. But with some fine-tuning, the blast furnaces could refine laterite ore into nickel pig iron, which can be used to make some steel alloys, including stainless steel.

Early Chinese producers burned coal, oil, wood chips and other materials to refine the laterite, which came mostly from Indonesia. The final product had only a small amount of nickel, but also iron, both needed ingredients.

<span id=""20"" class=""red"">As prices continued to climb, nickel pig iron became economical, and furnaces along China's eastern coast were put to work.

</span>The Tsingshan Holding Group was among the leaders. As one of China's major producers of stainless steel, it needed lots of nickel.

The company was encouraged by early trials with nickel pig iron, but the refining process was still crude and dirty. So Tsingshan began experiments, including at a plant near Ningde, a coastal town in Fujian province surrounded by low green mountains and grape farms.

The company tried rotary kiln electric furnaces, which use less energy than blast furnaces and can extract more nickel from the ore.

Many people were skeptical, said John Li, a Tsingshan-subsidiary vice president in Ningde. One day, he said, a furnace started leaking iron slag everywhere.

But the process eventually succeeded, trimming electricity needs by as much <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 40%,</span> said Jiang Xinfang, president-director of another Tsingshan subsidiary in Shanghai. Tsingshan now pumps out nickel pig iron <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 11% nickel</span>, the company said, compared <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 2% or</span> less using older techniques.

""At its core, this is a sort of revolution in the way nickel units are made,"" said Andrew Shaw, a commodities analyst at Credit Suisse in Singapore.

Tsingshan now gets about half the nickel it needs from its own nickel pig iron, Mr. Li said. At its Ningde-area operations, a port unloads ships of Indonesian ore, which is piled in tall dark-brown mounds that cover an area roughly the size of a football field.

<span id=""21"" class=""red"">Later, the ore is transferred to a smelting plant where it is fed into a tangle of rust-colored pipes, smokestacks and rotating kilns for conversion into liquid nickel pig iron.

</span>A blanket of foul-smelling smog envelops areas near Tsingshan's operation, though there are many other factories nearby, making it hard to know where all the pollution comes from. Some residents blame the pig iron plant.

Analysts say mining of Indonesian ore involves destructive stripping of the land in that country, as well.

But the rotary-kiln process has made refining significantly cleaner, according to analysts. Mr. Jiang at Tsingshan said his company's newest-generation operations include antidust equipment and low-sulfur coal.

Tsingshan's breakthroughs have been replicated across China. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">As nickel pig iron technology has improved, analysts say, the cost of processing it has fallen to as low <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $12,500 per</span> metric ton.

</span>""There's been this huge deflationary effect on the nickel industry as nickel pig iron has developed,"" said Gayle Berry, an analyst at Barclays in London. ""It certainly has destroyed the world"" for traditional nickel, added Jim Lennon, a nickel expert and consultant to Australia's Macquarie Bank, though supplies could tighten again in the future.

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">One concern for producers is that Indonesia may restrict exports of nickel ore next year to entice mining companies to build refining operations there.</span> Tsingshan is one of several companies taking steps to do so.

<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, Western miners are scrambling to deal with the new supply.</span> Analysts estimated that as much <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 40% of</span> the nickel mining industry is losing money these days. <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Some predict China will keep finding ways to supply its own needs.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive of Glencore-Xstrata, the world's fourth-largest nickel miner, said earlier this year he was pessimistic about the metal's future price.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">In October, his company announced it would mothball its Falcondo mine in the Dominican Republic because of falling nickel prices, eliminating as many <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 1,000 jobs</span>.</span> The company mines nickel ore in five countries, including Indonesia and sells much of it to China to make nickel pig iron.

""China is becoming self-sufficient"" in nickel, said Vladimir Potanin, chief executive of Norilsk, the world's top nickel producer. ""They are producing steel, which they need for their industrial development. They need this nickel pig iron close to where the steel is made. I think they're smart enough, and powerful enough to keep doing both forever.""

Mr. Li, of the Tsingshan subsidiary, was pleased with his country's revamping of nickel production, with benefits extending around the world. ""If we didn't have this nickel process in China,"" he said. <span id=""28"" class=""red"">""I think prices would <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">be $80,000.</span></span>""

The U.K.’s annual rate of inflation moved into double digits in July and is set to rise even higher by the end of the year, heaping greater pressure on stretched household budgets and threatening a lengthy economic contraction.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">That pickup in inflation has been replicated in other parts of Europe, even as consumer prices have started to slow in the U.S.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">That is because energy prices have continued to accelerate across Europe as Russia withholds supplies of natural gas, with the continent facing a possible crunch this winter.

66861d24a5f104da3398a8ea,88390,"<h3>Inside Mitch McConnell’s decades-long effort to block gun control</h3>Mitch McConnell was just finishing up his first term as the junior senator from Kentucky when a mass shooting rocked his hometown of Louisville.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">On Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1989,</span> a disgruntled employee entered the Standard Gravure printing plant in downtown Louisville and, armed with an AK-47 and other guns, killed eight and <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">wounded 12 others</span> before taking his own life — in what remains the deadliest mass shooting in the state’s history.

</span>At the time, mass shootings had not yet become the staple of American life that they are now, and McConnell said he was “deeply disturbed,” declaring, “We must take action to stop such vicious crimes.”

But he also added: “We need to be careful about legislating in the middle of a crisis.” And in the days and weeks after, he did not join others in calling for a ban on assault weapons like the AK-47 used by the shooter.

The Standard Gravure massacre provided an early glimpse of how McConnell — now the Republican Senate minority leader — would handle mass shootings and their aftermath over the next three decades, consistently working to delay, obstruct or prevent most major gun-control legislation from passing Congress.

McConnell would go on to follow a similar playbook time and time again during his seven terms in Congress, offering vague promises of action, often without any specifics, only to be followed by no action or incremental measures that avoided new gun regulations. As a Republican leader, he also helped dissuade his conference — as after <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2012 mass</span> shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. — from supporting gun legislation and, as majority leader, refused to bring up significant gun-control measures for a vote.

Now, the latest devastating and high-profile mass shootings — a massacre Tuesday at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Tex., that <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">left 19 students</span> and two teachers dead, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 10 days</span> after a racist slaughter at Buffalo supermarket that <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">killed 10 </span>— have thrust Congress back into a fiery debate over what, if anything, lawmakers can do to curb gun violence.

On Thursday, McConnell told CNN that he had encouraged Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) to reach out to Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) — who made gun control a personal project after Sandy Hook — to begin discussing what bipartisan measures might be possible.

But many Democrats and anti-gun advocates remain skeptical, predicting that McConnell and his fellow Republicans are poised to obstruct any consequential gun-violence-prevention bills yet again.

“If there’s any one individual in the United States to blame for our inability to put things in place to prevent gun violence, it’s Mitch McConnell,” said Peter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords, a group devoted to fighting gun violence. “McConnell understands he’s hostage to that extreme base that just doesn’t tolerate any departure from any of their views.”

Many Republicans say that McConnell is less a singular obstacle than a savvy leader who is able to his read his conference and make decisions that help his senators and protect them politically. “McConnell knows where his members stand and makes the tough calls to protect their interests,” a senior Republican aide said, explaining McConnell’s overall motivations in addressing gun violence and gun legislation.

McConnell declined to comment.

<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1990,</span> the year after the Standard Gravure shooting, McConnell was up for reelection and found himself in a close race with Democrat Harvey Sloane, then the Jefferson County judge executive and a former Louisville mayor, who had called for banning assault weapons.

<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2013,</span> following Sandy Hook, Sloane recounted in Louisville’s Courier-Journal newspaper that as his race with McConnell tightened in the final stretch, McConnell and the National Rifle Association “blistered the state falsely as to how this ban would eventually take away ‘your hunting gun and the hand pistol you need for personal protection.’ ”

McConnell defeated Sloane by five percentage points and, in his second term in the Senate, went on to vote against both the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1993 and</span> the Federal Assault Weapons Ban <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1994.</span>

“Mitch is really Machiavellian,” Sloane said in an interview with The Washington Post last week. “He’s single-handedly held up any kind of gun legislation that’s meaningful.”

‘It didn’t change a thing’

In <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2019,</span> a group of gun-control advocates — including Kris Brown, the president of Brady, a gun violence prevention organization; Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights icon; and Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.), who lost her 17-year-old son in <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2012 shooting</span> — gathered on the West Lawn of the Capitol for a rally in favor of tougher background checks.

After the rally, some in the group — which also included some McConnell constituents — decided to make their way to the then-majority leader’s office for what Lewis might have called “good trouble.”

“So we walked over, John Lewis kind of leading us, talking about the importance of peaceful resistance,” Brown recalled, adding that Lewis asked if someone should get Depends — a brand of adult diapers — because the group might be there for a while.

“His staffers had no idea what to do with us,” Brown said. “McConnell didn’t have the human decency to sit down with John Lewis.”

Instead, a McConnell staffer ushered the group into a conference room and met with them for over an hour. Brown said that the staffer clearly seemed moved by Lewis, telling him that she held him in high esteem, and by the victims of gun violence, who recounted their stories one after another.

“She was moved to tears, but it didn’t change a thing,” Brown said, saying the staffer essentially told the group “that it was just the wrong time to bring this bill forward.”

Doug Andres, a McConnell spokesman, said McConnell had been unable to meet with the group at the time because it was a surprise visit and he already had constituent meetings planned. He said the staffer simply explained to the group that then-President Donald Trump was unlikely to sign the bill they were pitching, and McConnell was not going to advocate for legislation he knew would fail.

For McConnell, however, the time has rarely seemed right.

Almost immediately after Sandy Hook, then-President Barack Obama tasked then-Vice President Joe Biden with putting together a robust policy response. McConnell — then the Senate minority leader — downplayed the effort.

Asked about gun-control issues on ABC’s “This Week” in <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2013 </span>— less than month after Sandy Hook — <span id=""1"" class=""red"">McConnell said he was waiting to see Biden’s proposal but did not plan to prioritize it over other issues like “spending and debt” in the coming months.

</span>Then, later that month — after Obama <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">signed 23 executive</span> orders on guns in response to the tragedy that <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">left 20 kindergartners</span> dead — McConnell recorded a robocall and sent it out to gun owners in his state.

“President Obama and his team are doing everything in their power to restrict your constitutional right to keep and bear arms,” McConnell said in the recording. “Their efforts to restrict your rights, invading your personal privacy and overstepping their bounds with executive orders, is just plain wrong.”

McConnell also refused a meeting with the Sandy Hook families, according to someone familiar with the request, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal details. But eventually, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W. Va.) and Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) negotiated a modest bipartisan background checks bill, known as Manchin-Toomey.

At the time, McConnell was still adjusting to the rise of the hard-right tea party movement in the Republican base; in <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2010 Republican</span> Senate primary in Kentucky, Rand Paul vanquished Trey Grayson, McConnell’s handpicked candidate, by riding the tea party wave in what some also viewed as a stinging rebuke of McConnell. And <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2013,</span> McConnell was already preparing for <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2014 reelection</span> bid.

When Manchin-Toomey finally came to the Senate floor for a vote in <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2013,</span> McConnell pushed his conference to oppose the bill, which ultimately <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">failed 54 to</span><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 46,</span> falling short of <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 60 votes</span> needed for passage.

“McConnell whipped hard against it. McConnell is obsessed with protecting his right flank,” said Adam Jentleson, who at the time worked for then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), explaining why McConnell helped tank the background check bill. “It’s why he’s been able to survive as leader for so long.”

Jesse Benton — a conservative activist who managed Paul’<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2010 Senate</span> campaign and who McConnell enlisted to manage <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2014 one</span> — said that McConnell at the time “said something to me like, ‘I hope you know I’m not planning on supporting any of this crap.' ”

“He’s not a firebrand like some of the [pro-gun] activists want, but he makes it clear to his team that he is a Second Amendment believer,” Benton said. “He respects the legislative process and the fact that there are differing opinions in his own caucus, but he works it in his own way, as only he can.”

McConnell was, at other times, willing to entertain the idea of some legislation on guns, partly as a way of releasing pressure from members of his caucus who wanted to show some legislative action after mass shootings.

But that approach has also earned him the ire of some Second Amendment advocates, some of whom ran ads against him during <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2014 primary</span>.

“When the going gets tough, Mitch McConnell has always been absent from the fight,” said Dudley Brown, the president of the National Association for Gun Rights, a hard-line alternative to the NRA. “He has never stood up when it was really tough.”

‘An obstacle to taking any action’

For McConnell,<span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 opened</span> with a mass shooting at Marshall County High School near Benton, Ky., where a 15-year-old student killed two and injured more than a dozen others that January. The following month, another school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">left 17 dead</span> and drew yet another national outcry for stronger gun measures.

At the time, Trump offered messaging whiplash. In a meeting with Democratic and Republican lawmakers two weeks after Parkland, he called for “comprehensive” gun legislation and chided Republicans for being “petrified” of the NRA. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But the next day, he hosted an NRA lobbyist in the Oval Office, declared the meeting “great” on Twitter and seemed to lose interest in working on gun legislation.

</span>Still, a McConnell aide said, the combination of the Florida and Kentucky school shootings prompted McConnell, by then the Senate majority leader, to help pass two modest bills on background checks (the Fix NICS Act) and school safety (the Stop School Violence Act).

The Fix NICS Act helped improve the criminal background checks system to make background checks more thorough and accurate, and the stopping school violence measure authorized additional funding for improving school security and early intervention and school violence prevention programs.

Another big push for gun legislation came in the summer <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2019,</span> following back-to-back shootings on Aug.<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 and</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4 at</span> a Walmart Supercenter in majority-Hispanic El Paso and in a nightlife corridor in Dayton, Ohio, which left a <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">combined 23 people</span> dead and dozens more injured.

The Democratic blowback was fierce and directed squarely at McConnell — who was again campaigning for reelection — since the House had already passed a background check bill.

“I hope that Sen. McConnell would bring the Senate back tomorrow and pass the background check bill and send it to the president,” Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown said after the shootings.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">The same day, Shannon Watts of Moms Demand Action, a gun violence prevention group, declared, “We need Mitch McConnell to allow a vote.”

</span>The Twitter account of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) retweeted both statements, and several days later, Pelosi wrote a public letter to Trump asking him to call on McConnell — whom she described as “an obstacle to taking any action” — to call the Senate back into session.

By the night of Aug.<span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,</span> protesters had gathered outside McConnell’s Kentucky home with profane chants. Days later, dozens gathered outside his Louisville office.

That Thursday, Aug.<span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span> McConnell went on Louisville’s WHAS-AM radio to say he had spoken with Trump and was ready to take action. The president, he said, was “anxious to get an outcome, and so am I.”

“What we can’t do is fail to pass something,” McConnell said. “What I want to see here is an outcome.”

He added that background checks — which he said had “a lot of support” publicly — and red flag measures would probably lead the discussion.

But a special session was never called.

The week before returning to Washington, McConnell did an interview with Hugh Hewitt on Sept.<span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 that</span> laid out a different benchmark, deferring to Trump: “I said several weeks ago that if the president took a position on a bill so that we knew we would actually be making a law and not just having serial votes, I’d be happy to put it on the floor.”

By the time McConnell brought the Senate back in session, his focus had shifted. In his first remarks on the Senate floor, McConnell made no mention of the gun issue. Just over a week later, The Post reported on a whistleblower complaint about Trump’s communications with a foreign leader, eventually leading to Trump’s first impeachment for his efforts to withhold military aid to Ukraine — drawing Trump’s attention away from guns.

This past Wednesday, the day after the devastating Uvalde elementary school shooting, McConnell — now the Senate minority leader again — took to the Senate floor to declare himself and the nation “sickened and outraged by the senseless evil” that left at <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 19 students</span> and two teachers “murdered for no apparent reason at all.”

He did not mention guns or any possible legislation, instead focusing on the “innocent young lives” that were prematurely extinguished.

“Words simply fail,” McConnell said.

On Thursday, however, McConnell tasked Cornyn with negotiating with Democrats.

“Maybe this will provide some impetus” for compromise, Cornyn told reporters at the Capitol on Thursday. “This is horrible. Hard to imagine anything that could be worse than parents worrying about the safety of their kids going to school.”

But most Republicans signaled in recent days that major legislation remains unlikely.

“There are no right words to describe the heartbreaking and horrific tragedy that happened at Robb Elementary School,” said Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), before adding later: “We must be thoughtful about how we discuss and handle school safety and mental health issues. Federal changes should not be made in haste, and there’s still many details we do not know as the investigation continues.”

After a vigil for the Uvalde victims, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) stormed away from an interview when a British reporter asked him why mass shootings happen “only in America.” Cruz accused the reporter of having a “political agenda.”

Cruz also dismissed Democratic gun violence prevention proposals, saying that none of them would have stopped the Uvalde shooting, and later suggested legislation to “harden schools” — such as having only one usable door.

On Friday, Trump — still the de facto leader of the Republican Party — joined other Republican officials in delivering a defiant response to the Uvalde massacre at an NRA annual meeting in Houston, arguing that new gun restrictions were pointless.

Support for stricter gun laws has increased after mass shootings at schools. In <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2018,</span> shortly after the Parkland shooting,<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 67 percent</span> said in a Gallup Poll that laws should be more strict — an increase <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 60 percent</span> who said the same in <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2017.</span> Similarly, support for stricter laws jumped <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 43 percent</span> <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 58 percent</span> after the Sandy Hook shooting.

In contrast to support for gun restrictions in general, support for expanding background checks has stayed very high over time. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">A Pew Research Center poll last year <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">found 81 percent</span> of Americans supported making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks, <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 70 percent</span> of Republicans <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 92 percent</span> of Democrats.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">A 63 percent</span> majority supported a ban on assault-style weapons, <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 83 percent</span> of Democrats and less than half as many Republicans (37 percent).

But many gun-control advocates and Democrats remain skeptical that Republicans are prepared to change their approach. Matt Bennett — a co-founder of Third Way, a Democratic think tank — said polarized politics prevents the handful of Republicans who may privately support some gun safety laws to do so publicly.

“The ones who believe in their hearts that they should do something — and who knows how many there truly are — don’t want to do it, because they don’t want to get crosswise with the base,” Bennett said.

John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, latched onto McConnell’s declaration on the Senate floor that “words simply fail.”

He said he agrees completely.

“I don’t want to mince words. The Republican senators are what is costing American lives. And McConnell is the head of the Republican Senate,” Feinblatt said. “I am encouraged that McConnell gave the green light to Cornyn. That is what I would call step one.”

“But,” he added, “There is no question about it: Inaction is not an option.”

Updated Nov.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 6</span>:57 pm ET

An international race to lower corporate taxes is back in the global spotlight after Britain recommitted to slashing rates and as the election of Donald Trump puts U.S. corporate-tax overhauls on the front burner.

</span>U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday officially endorsed a move by Britain’s previous Conservative government to lower the main corporate rate there <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 17% by</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020,</span> from today’<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 20%.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">President-elect Donald Trump promoted on the campaign trail <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 15% U</span>.S. headline corporate tax-rate—down from the <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">current 35%.</span>

</span>Mr. Trump’s plan is far from a done deal. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">It faces domestic political hurdles and fiscal reality.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">And Mrs. May backed a tax cut already approved by Parliament but stopped short of endorsing her predecessor’s further recommendation—made after the Brexit vote—to go down <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15%.</span>

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Still, the rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic represent the latest volleys in a long tradition of trying to use national corporate-tax codes to spur investment at home or lure foreign firms.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The new attention being paid to corporate tax in both places follows close on the heels of recent moves in Japan, Canada, Italy and France to attract investment with lower rates of their own.

</span>For Britain, the Brexit decision has made the pressure to keep the welcome mat out especially intense. The country, in particular London, has been a magnet for global firms looking to set up European beachheads or global offices. It benefits from a convenient time zone between Asia and the Americas, strong legal protections and a large pool of well-educated, English-speaking workers.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">But after Britain’s <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 23 vote</span> to leave the European Union, many companies based there have scrambled to assess whether they will continue to benefit from two other, big advantages that come with EU membership: unfettered access to Europe’s common market and the free movement of labor across the bloc.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Britain’s Institute of Directors, a group of company directors and senior business leaders, found in a poll shortly after the vote that more than a fifth of respondents said they were considering moving some of their operations outside the U.K. because of the vote.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Mrs. May has tried to assure British and foreign companies that the U.K. will continue to be a competitive place to do business.</span> Her charm offensive has included closed-door meetings with corporate heads such as Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Nissan Motor Co., the second-largest car maker in the U.K. Mr. Ghosn had considered passing over Sunderland and picking a factory in continental Europe to build a new model, but he backtracked after meeting with Mrs. May.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Mrs. May’s announcement, made in a speech to U.K. business leaders, reassured companies that she was still prepared to carry through on the tax reductions approved by Parliament during her predecessor’s government.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">She didn’t mention a specific tax-cutting target.

</span>That left unclear whether she would be willing to embrace a further cut <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15%,</span> which was proposed—but never acted upon—by then-Prime Minister David Cameron’s government in the immediate wake of the Brexit vote. An aide to Mrs. May said only she was committed to the plans already in place to cut the rate <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2020 to</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17%.</span>

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Still, business leaders took it as a strong signal of support for keeping corporate tax low.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">“It’s good to see the government reaffirm its commitment to lower corporation tax,” said a spokesman for the Confederation of British Industry, a trade group.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">The plan to gradually move to <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 17% corporate</span>-tax rate would give Britain the lowest headline corporate-tax rate among the Group <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20,</span> a collection of the world’s richest nations.</span> At the <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">current 20%,</span> its headline rate is already one of the lowest in the G-20, equal to that of Turkey, Russia and Saudi Arabia. <span id=""14"" class=""red""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">At 17%,</span> it would still be above Ireland’<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 12.5%,</span> but well below most other large economies.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">It might also be at the limit of what Britain’s finances can stand.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">“Britain has a large deficit and is very constrained on how much tax-cutting it can do,” said Charles Beer, managing director of independent tax advisory Taxand in Britain.</span> He said the government could speed up implementing <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 17% rate</span>, “but it’s hard to see how they can do a major move down.”

Vodafone Group PLC said in the days immediately after the June vote that it might have to reconsider its U.K. headquarters. It has since backtracked, saying it is happy to be British based. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">A spokesman declined to comment on Mrs. May’s tax pledge.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The race to lower corporate taxes comes amid a broader tax shake-up that has played out over recent years.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Almost 100 countries</span>, including the U.S. and most of Europe, have agreed to close—or at least narrow—legal loopholes that big companies use to shift profits to places where they pay little or no income tax.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">EU regulators have also taken aim at tailor-made tax deals between certain member countries and companies.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">“Once those loopholes are closed the main way countries can compete is by lowering their base corporate tax rate,” said Paolo Giacometti, a partner at Italian law firm Chiomenti.</span> “So we will see this trend continue.”

<span id=""22"" class=""red"">It is often hard to compare corporate-tax rates in an apples-to-apples fashion.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Some countries have wider corporate-tax bases, for instance, or charge different rates for different-sized companies.</span> Companies also have to contend with an array of regional taxes, such as U.S. state taxes. Still, the national rate is often the easiest-to-convey message of welcome—or warning—a government can send to corporate executives.

Germany and Ireland made big cuts at the beginning of this century in a bid to attract corporate investment. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Berlin clawed back much of what it lost in revenue by making it harder for companies to take deductions.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Ireland’s sharp headline corporate-tax cuts early in the decade helped it become one of Europe’s most attractive destinations for many companies looking for European or global headquarters.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">But it is also now pulling back on other corporate-tax benefits.</span> Two years ago, for instance, Dublin said it would end <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2020 a</span> gambit it called the “Double Irish.” <span id=""27"" class=""red"">The structure allowed multinationals to lower their taxable profit in one Irish subsidiary by paying royalties into another Irish-registered subsidiary that was managed in a tax haven—making it exempt from Irish income tax.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Italy in <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2015 moved</span> to lower its national corporate tax rate <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 3.5 percentage</span> points, <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 24%.</span></span> That reduction takes effect next year. Even France, long a holdout, has embraced the trend in the past few years, though rates in the country are still higher than in most of Europe.

Japan, struggling to promote growth as the country’s population ages, has been cutting the rate to encourage investment. This year, the rate <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 2 percentage</span> points <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 30%,</span> bringing the drop <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 10 points</span> in just a few years.

In the U.S., however, the policy debate has been stalled for years, despite bipartisan consensus to lower corporate taxes. <span id=""29"" class=""red"">The U.S. rate is now the world’s highest, though effective tax rates are lower than <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 35% marginal</span> rate.</span> House Republicans have proposed <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 20% rate</span>, saying they want to leapfrog other countries that have been reducing their rates more incrementally. President Barack Obama several years ago proposed <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 28% rate</span> <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 25% for</span> manufacturers.

<span id=""30"" class=""red"">Unlike many other countries, the U.S. doesn’t have a value-added tax—akin to a federal sales tax—that it can increase while cutting the corporate tax rate.</span> <span id=""31"" class=""red"">That means Washington has had to look for offsetting revenue elsewhere.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">All the likely sources—a broader corporate tax base, higher taxes on small businesses and wider budget deficits—are politically problematic.

66861d24a5f104da3398a8ea,28411,"<h3>Pinkerton: Why Buying Greenland Is One of Donald Trump’s Best Ideas</h3>Last week, the Wall Street Journal had a scoop of sorts; the headline read, “President Trump Eyes a New Real-Estate Purchase: Greenland: In conversations with aides, the president has — with varying degrees of seriousness — floated the idea of the U.S. buying the autonomous Danish territory.”
Greenland, of course, is a huge island in the Atlantic, most of it north of the Arctic Circle. As such, even though it <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">boasts 836,000 square</span> miles of territory — more than a quarter the size of the continental U.S. — it counts a population of <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 55,000.</span>
In other words, the great landmass is ripe for development, so it’s no wonder Trump, real estate man, wants to take a crack at developing it — on behalf of the nation, if not for himself. Indeed, wits were quick to riff on what a Trumpified Greenland would look like.
Needless to say, the Journal’s report sparked a wide variety of reactions; the Danish government immediately said “no,” while one New York City tabloid laughed, even as other organs of the mainstream media heaped on their own ridicule. Not surprisingly, one MSNBC talking head went beyond attacking Trump to attack Trump supporters, chortling, “Can anybody at the MAGA rally point out Greenland on a map?”
In response, Trump kept the door open, telling reporters on August 18:
Strategically, it’s interesting, and we’d be interested, but we’ll talk to them a little bit. It’s not number one on the burner.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow added:
We’re looking at it …</span> Greenland is a strategic place. They’ve got a lot of valuable minerals … the president, who knows a thing or two about buying real estate, wants to take a look.
A few others were supportive; Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) tweeted on August 15:
This a smart geopolitical move. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The United States has a compelling strategic interest in Greenland, and this should absolutely be on the table.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Indeed, America’s strategic interest in Greenland has long been recognized.</span> As Foreign Policy magazine noted, the U.S. has tried, twice, to buy Greenland — once after the Civil War and again after World War Two. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">(During WWII, Uncle Sam used Greenland for military basing and supply; to this day, there’s a major Air Force base at Thule, less <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1,000 miles</span> from the North Pole.)
</span>In fact, <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1917,</span> America purchased the Danish West Indies from Denmark; we <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paid $25 million</span>, renaming them the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Indeed, in its history, the U.S. has bought plenty of land, including the Louisiana Territory from the French <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1803 and</span> Alaska from the Russians <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1867.</span> In each case, the pittance Uncle Sam spent was repaid a thousand-fold, not just because of the natural resources involved, nor just because expansive land helped Americans spread out and own their own property, but also because, by taking possession of that territory, we kept a hostile power from possessing it. (We can pause to consider how much more difficult America’s existence would have been, for example, if Napoleon had controlled the Mississippi River, or if the Russians had enjoyed a foothold in North America.)
So now, Greenland is a possible new frontier. The Danes have controlled it for centuries, and frankly, they haven’t done much with it. One reason, of course, is that it’s frigid and, indeed, mostly covered in glacier ice. And yet with the right mindset, inclement weather is only an obstacle, not a roadblock. As plucky Americans have proven in Alaska and elsewhere, we’re perfectly capable of dealing with harsh weather; after all, ice, cold, and isolation are irresistible to hardy vacationers and those who simply wish to really get away from it all.
Moreover, if profit beckons, miners and drillers can always punch their way through. And how much profit is to be had? The truth is, we really don’t know how much natural wealth is to be found in Greenland because nobody has ever seriously looked.
So why haven’t they looked? It’s because the Danes have chosen to treat the territory, for the most part, like a giant nature preserve. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">And that’s why the native population of Greenland mostly lives in relative poverty as poor dependents of the masters in Copenhagen.</span> Yes, it’s an odd kind of neocolonialism there in the North Atlantic as the politically correct Danes pat themselves on the back for their “enlightened eco-consciousness,” even as Greenlanders stay poor.
Yet even from afar, we know that Greenland offers a fantastic development opportunity. And so, if the Danes are too green and politically correct to extract that wealth, perhaps the U.S. can blaze a rich new trail.
Of course, some will say that all this is a pipe-dream, even if the U.S. were to become sovereign in Greenland. That is, the greens in America would work just as hard as the greens in Denmark to stop any such development, preferring to leave Greenland as it is, undeveloped. Yes, American greens, backed up by numerous billion-dollar foundations, would do precisely that: They’d organize, agitate, and litigate to leave Greenland to the seals and polar bears.
So we can see: Green power is not to be underestimated. As a matter of fact, the greens are so powerful in the U.S. that they have, in much of the country, taken the issue of natural resource development off the table. That’s why, for example, efforts to fully exploit America’s hydrocarbon resources have been stymied. As has been pointed out by Breitbart News, the total value of oil and natural gas, under federal lands and waters, <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is $128 trillion</span>. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">That’s a lot of wealth — six times America’s annual GDP, six times our national debt — and yet green power is such that few even talk about tapping into our natural abundance.
</span>So if Greenland were on the agenda, we could at least ask: What’s the value of underground resources in Greenland? And the answer is, simply, nobody knows. And yet we should be confident that the number is, well, yuge.
There’s a good reason — a cosmic reason, one might say — why we should be confident that there are plenty of resources to be found in Greenland. And that’s because valuable elements, and the resulting compounds and minerals, have been scattered all over the earth by the same gargantuan forces that created the universe in the first place. That is, all the naturally occurring elements in the periodic table — from copper to iron, from silver to gold — were created by nucleosynthesis, either as the result of the Big Bang eons ago or by subsequent stellar activity. All that nucleosynthesis has had the effect of hurling gases and matter around the universe until some of it was accreted into celestial bodies, such as our sun and its planets — and including our earth.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">So that’s why raw resources are both so abundant and so widely distributed here on this third rock from the sun; as Charlton Heston might have thundered at his Ten Commandments best, we can behold the mighty hands of God that have whipped treasures all around the globe, including in Greenland.
</span>Now here’s where human mind-power comes into the equation. All through human history, smart and hard-working people have unlocked value from seemingly barren patches of land; that is, they have learned to find, refine, and otherwise gain the riches of the earth. That was the story, for example, of Texas and Oklahoma, a century or more ago: tumbleweeds turned into oil rigs.
Indeed, ever since, the smart and the hard-working have found yet more ways to find additional oil and other hydrocarbons. In doing so, they have the defied most “experts.” You see, back in the early 1970s, savants opined that the world was in the midst of an “energy crisis,” and so we had to cut back on everything and live with less.
Yet in the decades since, in defiance of those brainiacs, we have proven that there was no such natural energy crisis. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The biggest problem was the unnatural imposition of U.S. price controls, finally lifted by President Ronald Reagan <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1981.</span></span> After Reagan de-controlled oil, its production surged. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Indeed, it surged so much that prices actually fell.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">In other words, the free market delivered an unabashed win-win: more production and lower prices.
</span>In the meantime, a whole new group of entrepreneurs and innovators came along, finding new ways to squeeze oil out of old fields; one such was George P. Mitchell (1919-2013), the Texas-born pioneer of fracking. As a result, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1980,</span> proven oil reserves in the U.S. have risen by more than a third, and around the world, reserves have nearly tripled.
So now, looking to the future, there’s every reason to believe that the same sequence would happen in Greenland: new thinking + new production = new wealth.
Of course, the greens would oppose all of this. They would say that they are worried about the puffins, of course, and they would also say they’re worried about climate change. That is, if we extracted and burned more carbon-based fuels, more carbon dioxide would enter into the atmosphere.
Yet seen through the proper prism of informed imagination, Greenland offers great hope for addressing that issue as well. That is, if the concern is that too much carbon dioxide is entering the atmosphere, there’s a simple enough thing to do: capture it. After all, if it was put into the atmosphere, it can be pulled out.
So how, exactly, to pull out the CO2? That can be done in lots of ways, including direct-air capture, as advocated by Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY). And there’s the related, perhaps simpler, idea of planting a lot of trees — call that organic carbon capture.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">As this author has argued here at Breitbart News, carbon capture by any means — industrial or biological — would be a powerful engine of rural economic development.
</span>So now we come back to Greenland. As noted, Greenland is more than a quarter the size of the <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Lower 48.</span> So that gives us plenty of vacant land to work with — to dig, to drill, to otherwise enjoy — and then, at the same time, the land can be used for carbon capture. Yes, it’s mostly ice, and yet useful things can be built on top of ice. And carbon could be the key ingredient.
After all, thanks to its marvelous bonding properties, carbon is the building block of just about everything, and so if we use our brains, we can figure out how to solidify carbon to make new structures — applying, for instance, 3-D printing to the construction of homes, towns, even whole cities. Heck, if we wanted to, we could make a carbon-nanotube space elevator; now that would be the world’s coolest carbon sink.
And if we need energy in Greenland, and we don’t find it in carbon fuels, we would have plenty of other options — if we keep our minds open. For instance, one visionary has suggested creating energy from moving weights around to power generators, and those weights could even be made of ice. (And if the ice melts, carbon capture might help restore the ice.)
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">By this reckoning, Greenland could be just the beginning of a whole new worldwide economic boom.</span> If we can develop that icy island, then there’s the rest of the Arctic, and also the Antarctic. And come to think of it, closer to home, there’s all the un-utilized land in the U.S.; the federal government <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">owns 28 percent</span> of all our territory. We need never touch the Grand Canyon or other precious parks; instead, we can start with <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 61 percent</span> of Alaska that the feds are sitting on.
So let’s give Trump credit for his Greenland idea. Even if nothing comes of it during his presidency, he has expanded the “Overton Window” — that is, the range of acceptable political discourse — reminding us that greatness comes from expansion and innovation, not from contraction and enervation.
One fine day, development will come to Greenland, as well as to other desolate places. Such development can, and should, be done cleanly as well as profitably.
There may never be a Trump Tower in Greenland. But even so, the MAGA spirit could be extended to include the new phrase, MGGA — Make Greenland Great Again.

66861d24a5f104da3398a8ea,23219,"<h3>Assange's Arrest Was Possible Because Ecuador Abandoned Socialism</h3>The shocking news Thursday morning that the government of Ecuador invited British police into its embassy in London to arrest Wikileaks founder Julian Assange left many questioning why the Latin American country, which protected Assange for over half a decade, now felt comfortable letting him go.
The move by President Lenin Moreno – a socialist in name only who has used his tenure in office to liberalize the country after a decade of socialist rule – is the latest salvo in his ongoing campaign to erase the legacy of predecessor Rafael Correa.
Moreno is a member of Correa’s socialist party and became president after the latter threatened to dismantle the entire government if Ecuadorians did not elect his hand-picked successor. Yet he has all but eviscerated the relationship Correa cultivated with Marxist dictators in Venezuela and Cuba, demanded a revision of the country’s ties to communist China, and led a probe into Correa’s tenure that culminated in an arrest warrant for the former head of state.
This week, Moreno cut yet another Correa-era alliance, this time with a controversial antagonist whose only use to Correa was to annoy the U.S. government and help him cover up for authoritarian acts against Ecuadorian journalists.
“Ecuador is a generous country and a nation with open arms. Ours is a government respectful of the principles of international law, and of the institution of the right of asylum,” Moreno stated in a video message distributed on social media explaining the reasoning behind allowing Assange’s arrest. “Granting or withdrawing asylum is a sovereign right of the Ecuadorian state, according to international law.”
Moreno called Assange “disrespectful and aggressive” and accused him of “threatening declarations against Ecuador.” Beyond Assange’s personal behavior, however, Moreno argued that keeping him protected at the embassy violated international law.
“Ecuador’s patience with the behavior of Mr. Assange has reached its limit,” he concluded.
Ecuador decidió soberanamente retirar el asilo diplomático a Julian Assange por violar reiteradamente convenciones internacionales y protocolo de convivencia. #EcuadorSoberano pic.twitter.com/V02pvvtPY0

Correa</span></span> was among the first on Twitter to condemn Moreno, writing from exile in Belgium.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">“Lenin Moreno, the nefarious president of Ecuador, has demonstrated his poverty of humanity to the world, handing over Julian Assange – not just a refugee, but also an Ecuadorian citizen – to British police,” Correa wrote.</span> “This risks Assange’s life and humiliates Ecuador. Day of national mourning.”
Correa does not mention that Moreno’s government, not his, extended the courtesy of citizenship to Assange.
Lenín Moreno, nefasto presidente del Ecuador, ha demostrado su miseria humana al mundo, entregando a Julián Assange -no solo asilado, sino también ciudadano ecuatoriano- a la policía británica.
Esto pone en riesgo la vida de Assange, y humilla al Ecuador.

Correa</span></span> went on to call Moreno “the biggest traitor in Ecuadorian and Latin American history” in a barrage of Twitter posts. At press time, Correa has insulted Moreno on <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Twitter 12 times</span>, not counting retweets of others’ insults.
Reports and rumors that Moreno sought to evict Assange have circulated repeatedly in the past year, reaching a fever pitch when Assange attempted to file a lawsuit against the Ecuadorian government in October for “violating fundamental rights and freedoms” while he stayed at the embassy. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Assange was particularly offended by Ecuador’s demand he pay his internet bill if he wished to use the service, though reports also listed among Ecuador’s requests matters less clearly related to “fundamental rights and freedoms” such as Assange’s refusal to clean up after his cat.</span> The Ecuadorian courts dismissed the suit.
The Ecuadorian government’s issues with Assange aside, his status as a Correa-era bargaining chip proved of little value to Moreno. When Assange took refuge in the embassy <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> socialism was ascendant in South America and then-Ecuadorian President Correa had allied himself with the region’s worst leftist dictators: Cuba’s Fidel Castro and Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez. Correa had just begun emulating the Chávez tactic of shutting down opposition media networks when Assange’s legal situation made state protection – from any state – a must. Correa took the opportunity to lend Assange a hand, claiming to protect the right to a free press and a win against perennial Latin American leftist bogeyman “imperialism” in the process.
“They don’t realize Latin America is free and sovereign. We won’t tolerate interference, colonialism of any kind,” Correa said of the British at the time.
That language, which often featured anti-American tropes, defined the Correa era, as it did that of many leaders in the region at the time: Chávez, Castro regime henchmen, Bolivia’s Evo Morales, Peru’s Ollanta Humala, Argentina’s Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, among others. When right-wing challengers arose to replace many of these leaders later in the decade, many assumed Correa’s socialist movement to be among the few survivors of the continent’s rejection of socialism because of Lenin’s victory. Correa had supported Lenin vocally, at one point telling voters that, should they vote for his conservative rival, Correa would use an obscure procedural rule to dismantle the government and force another election over and over until voters got it “right.”
It took little time for Moreno to use his presidential powers to shift Ecuador rightward. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Under Moreno, Ecuador reversed policies to silence critics in the media and liberalized the economy.</span> It stopped pouring funds into Telesur, a far-left propaganda network largely controlled by Venezuela and Cuba. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">It has begun reevaluating oil deals with China that may have cost the Latin American country millions, presumably in exchange for political support on the global stage.</span> Those deals resulted in Ecuadorian courts first subpoenaing Correa to testify, then ordering his arrest. Moreno’s government has also enacted presidential term limits to block Correa for running for office again.
Most spectacularly, Moreno cut ties to Correa’s closest foreign ally, Venezuela. In an acrimonious declaration in August, Ecuador’s Foreign Ministry cut ties with the Maduro regime, resulting in an exchange of words with the Venezuelan Foreign Minister in which the latter referred to Moreno as a “liar” and a puppet of the United Nations. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Ecuador’s government issued a formal response calling the minister an “embarrassment” and a “poor excuse for a human being,” and his government “sinister.”
Tensions between Moreno and Latin America’s leftists, who once considered him one of their own, will likely continue to worsen as the Venezuelan political crisis continues, bringing the economies of its allies like Cuba down with it.</span> With Assange’s arrest, Moreno has signaled to those powers that he has no intention of returning to their circle.

66861d24a5f104da3398a8ea,49697,"<h3>Skiing Kosovo, Abandoned Lifts and All</h3>The flakes stumbled into the windows, gathered themselves and then wobbled on like revelers caught between pubs. At times it snowed so hard I could hardly see anything out there at all. A wood hut. A concrete wall. When the storm finally broke three days later, <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 40 inches</span> of snow had fallen and everything sprang to life.
The timing was ideal. A few hours earlier, I had arrived in Pristina, the red-roofed capital of Kosovo, just as the first flakes corkscrewed their way to earth. It was February, frigid, and a worsted wool blanket stretched across the Balkan sky. I threw my skis into the back of a 4Runner with two Serbs I had hired to pick me up, and we rode south in silence toward the Sharr Mountains along the Macedonian border. In an hour we’d be at Brezovica, the most delightfully dysfunctional ski resort in Europe.
You’ve probably heard of Kosovo but not of skiing in Kosovo. Landlocked between Albania and Serbia, Kosovo was the last of the nations to congeal in the caldron of old Yugoslavia. For years it remained a largely autonomous province tucked in southwestern Serbia, but a full-blown war for independence erupted there <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1998 between</span> Orthodox Serbs and ethnic Albanians, who are Muslims. The fighting grew so ugly with a Serb-sponsored campaign of ethnic cleansing that NATO eventually intervened on the Albanians’ behalf <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1999.</span> Today, to the United States and <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 110 other</span> countries that recognize it, Kosovo stands as Europe’s newest country, an eight-year-old diamond of roughly two million friendly, westward-looking people still struggling to get on their feet.
But before all of that there was skiing, and Yugoslavia had plenty of it, from Kranjska Gora in the north to Papova Shapka in the south. The sport soared in popularity when the Olympics came to Bosnia <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1984 and</span> a Slovenian, Jure Franko, won silver in the giant slalom to clinch Yugoslavia’s first Winter Olympic medal ever. Brezovica, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 250 miles</span> southeast of Sarajevo, served as a backup for those games, but Yugoslavia’s more hard-bitten skiers already knew the place for offering the steepest slopes and deepest powder for the fewest dinars.
There near the Serbian enclave of Strpce <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 35 miles</span> south of Pristina, storms slam into <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 8,000</span>-foot Sharr Mountains that rocket out of the Metohija basin with abrupt ridges and mighty shoulders cupping some of the continent’s most extensive pasturelands. Back in the ’80s, the resort’s hey-decade,<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10 lifts</span>, including five surface tows, serviced nine named runs, though the real magic happened in the go-anywhere terrain of the open north-facing bowls. D.J.s from Belgrade and Skopje kept the parties going until dawn. In the morning you might awake to find so much snow had fallen that even the wild chamois were stuck.
Brezovica survived the wars but not the peace that followed. Throughout the early 2000s, INEX, the Serbian socially owned enterprise that managed the resort, stopped investing in Brezovica and everything began to crumble. One of the main hotels, a graceless rectangular prism, became a drafty concrete husk. The disco floor went cold. One by one the lifts failed, and <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2013 none</span> of them worked. The storied resort was all but dead.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Then last April, a French consortium signed a contract with Kosovo’s Trade and Industry Ministry to bring Brezovica back to life; the plan was so ambitious that many locals weren’t sure if it was true.</span> A group of some of the world’s biggest leisure resort development firms — MDP Consulting, the engineering firm Egis and the Compagnie des Alpes, the world’s largest ski area management company behind French ski resorts like Val d’Isère, Tignes and Méribel — agreed to invest half a billion dollars, <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 410 million</span> euros, over the <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 17 years</span> to make Brezovica one of the largest, if not the largest, mountain resorts in the Balkans. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">According to Jill Jamieson, a consultant who has worked on the finance package, that is the single largest private investment in the country since the war, if not ever.
</span>The scope of the proposal is mind-boggling. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The consortium has until May to put the financing in order, meaning work could begin this summer.</span> When complete, the resort, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 8,000 acres</span>, will be the size of one and a half Vails, nearly all of which is skiable and inside a national park. It will have the vertical drop of a Crested Butte, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 2,600 feet</span>. The number of hotel beds will grow <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 700 to</span><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,000 </span>— three times as many currently available across the entire country. Visitors will <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 100 miles</span> of slopes, high-speed lifts and three gondola-linked villages. Two international airports, Pristina and Skopje, are no more than a 90-minute drive. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">One day Brezovica might even provide a more budget-friendly alternative to skiing in the Alps.
</span>Skeptics abound, of course. Can the next greatest place to ski in Europe really be in a tiny war-weary country so obscure it’s hard to imagine anyone vacationing there at all? Is a mega-resort the most sustainable way to attract tourists? Will they even find enough snow on a warming planet? Never mind Kosovo’s rampant corruption and politics that are so cantankerous that politicians themselves have lobbed tear gas canisters in their own chambers at least six times in the last few months to disrupt their own proceedings.
And yet there is hope.
“If we can do this, we can do anything,” said Manik Begolli, an Albanian Kosovar who worked on a public-private partnership team contracted by the United States Agency for International Development to help find an investor.
Maybe. For the moment, though, I just hoped I could ski.
Seven-Elevens have bigger parking lots than Brezovica’s but that’s where the Serbs dropped me off just after dark as the storm gathered intensity. Igor Nikolcevic met me there in a camouflage snowboard jacket. He <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 42,</span> a Serb with closely cropped hair and soulful eyes. He grabbed my ski bag and led me up an icy path to a pizzeria that he started with his wife, Draginja, and which he named after his daughter, Tina. Tina now lives in Pristina. I could have her room, fuzzy kitten posters and all.
I followed Igor into the heart of the village, a collection of mostly hand-built cottages run by hangers-on who have eked out a living by offering basic services to the few who make it this far. There was the Cafe Braca and Restaurant Ljuboten. Skis lined the racks in a shop called Dane. The main chairlift out of the village, an ancient double chair, stood eerily quiet, the seats glazed in ice.
“What time will the lifts start running?” I asked.
“You mean, if they start running,” Igor replied.
That was actually an improvement over the last time I was here, <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> when INEX was hundreds of thousands of euros behind on its power bill and the utility company had cut electricity to the lifts. All was not lost. Instead, for €7 — <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $9 at</span> the time — the Dane guys would give you a ride to the top in a snow-grooming machine, where an entire resort’s worth of untracked powder tugged at my tips.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">It was some of the best skiing I’d ever had for less than a nickel a turn: an unlimited supply of deep, creamy snow on a steep, consistent fall line.</span> Others just hiked up a small rise with sleds or sipped brandy outside while music pumped from competing loudspeakers. I loved the vibe and vowed to return.
This time, two years later, there was at least the possibility that the lifts might run. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Sometime <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2014,</span></span> as the French were quietly studying the resort’s prospects, a cadre of groups, including the Kosovo Electricity Corporation, local officials and the minister of trade and industry, hashed out a deal to get two of the chairlifts spinning again.</span> The equipment was still old, maybe even from the 1970s, and too unsafe to operate in a blizzard. I would have to wait for fairer skies to ride them.
Igor pushed open a door and the pizzeria sighed a breath of warm air. Christmas lights hung from the log cabin frame and spilled a molten glow on the snow outside. Snowshoes, wooden skis and photographs of wintry scenes from the resort’s early days decorated the walls. A fire crackled in the wood stove. A pizzeria in Kosovo is one of the coziest places I know.
I took a seat at a long wooden table next to a local with an even longer face. His house two doors down had just succumbed to a chimney fire. With no firefighters to navigate the winding, snowy road up from Strpce in time, the men of the village had rallied to form a bucket brigade and fell a flame-licked tree. That saved the village but the house, a lovely wood and stone cottage, was a loss.
“It went up like paper,” said the owner, Andrej Kavcic. He poured two shots of slivovitz, the plum brandy, and handed me one. “What am I going to do?” he asked. “You pick yourself up and move on. What else.”
Stoicism seems to be a national trait in Kosovo, but there is no mistaking that the country is picking itself up. <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Some 80 percent</span> of the population was displaced during the war. Now new furniture stores sit along new highways lined with new gas stations. The Pristina airport underwent a €180 million expansion <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013 and</span> is now the third-busiest airport in the old Yugoslavia after Belgrade and Zagreb. Problems persist, but the country is making strides to protect its landscape, integrate into Europe and normalize relations with Belgrade, the reason behind parliament’s self-tear-gassing attacks.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The resort’s rebirth comes at a time when Kosovo could really use jobs.</span> Drive around the country and you’ll see smartly dressed people in cafes, in parks, in front of stores, anywhere but at work. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The resort could provide as many <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 3,000 jobs</span>, some temporary, many permanent, in a country where half the population is <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 30 and</span><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 58 percent</span> of the work force is “inactive.”
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">But more than that, travel insiders around the Balkans have long yearned to trade the region’s oily image of strife for that of the crisp fabric of an emerging adventure-travel destination.</span> The efforts appear to be working. <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2014,</span></span><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.7 million</span> international tourists visited Albania, up from <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 645,000 in</span><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2004.</span> And in Montenegro, you can sea kayak through the watercress on Skadar Lake or catch feisty trout in green Macedonian streams, both with guides.
Few Balkan countries beyond Croatia and Greece can entice transoceanic travelers as stand-alone destinations at the moment but, collectively, places like Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania can make for a wildly fascinating itinerary. Kosovo wants in on that action. Brezovica may be its best shot.
“Kosovo is absolutely ready for something like this,” said Pascal Roux, the chief executive of MDP Consulting and leader of the French consortium. “Brezovica could be the pearl of the Balkans.”
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Maybe so, but “it’s just hugely important to be sure it’s done right,” said Christopher Doyle, executive director for Europe of the Adventure Travel Trade Association, which champions sustainable adventure travel markets.</span> What is needed, he said, are “thoughtful supporting efforts to engage the local community and protect the environment.”
Across the Balkans, there is little doubt that skiing is having a moment. Ecosign, a Canadian mountain resort planning firm that has designed Alpine skiing venues for five Winter Olympics, has <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">completed 15 master</span> plans for new or drastically reorganized resorts, including three in Macedonia, four in Serbia and two in Greece. A Dubai-based firm in December announced plans to build <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $5 billion</span> “tourist city” with thousands of holiday homes near Bosnia’s Bjelasnica mountain, where the Olympics were held. Kopaonik, Serbia’s most developed ski resort, added a new six-person heated chairlift last year and a new hotel. Poiana Brasov in Romania recently spent €30 million expanding its terrain, adding snow-making and upgrading lifts.
If anyone stands to lose on the Brezovica deal, it’s Igor. His grandfather, Radojko Nikolcevic, was the ski area’s first general manager after the resort opened <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1954.</span> In the ’70s he built a hut that would become Tina’s pizzeria under Igor <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1993.</span> Today the Nikolcevices earn enough money selling pizzas in winter to last them the rest of the year. Now the consortium will level almost everything — the hotels, the village, the lifts. The Nikolcevices will get <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $250,000 in</span> expropriation fees, but money isn’t the issue.
“We’re happy people want to invest in the resort but never in my life have I been as afraid for my future as I am right now,” Igor said. “The mountains are in me.”
Over the next three days a frustrating pattern emerged. Each morning I awoke to another foot of snow, and each morning the lifts weren’t running. The Dane guys weren’t offering the seven-euro special. Hiking up alone would be misery. Still, I hoped for the best.
I lounged around Tina’s watching the snowflakes hit the windows or took naps under a shaggy blanket in Tina’s old room. The Nikolcevices treated me like family. We sat near the fire talking about life in Kosovo. On the war: “Stupid politicians caused it.” On being Serbs surrounded by Albanians: “We never have an argument.” On why I should not clear the table: “This is Balkans,” Draginja said. “Women do this.”
I helped anyway and then serviced my macho deficits by grabbing a shovel to clear snow off the pizzeria’s roof. The electricity flickered on and off.
“There is something beautiful when everything is broken,” Draginja told me later over a meal of tangy mountain cheese, winter cabbage and a Serbian dish of shredded pork called duvan cvarci. “Everyone comes together.”
On the fourth day, the storm thinned into a delicate fog, and, miracle of miracles, the lifts creaked to life. At last I could ski.
I raced out the door. Classic rock blared from the Che & Fox cafe. Vendors jammed folding tables into the snow to peddle Serbian beer, Austrian juices and Lucky Strikes. A man in the parking lot sat next to a delivery truck with a cardboard sign: ski rentals €5. I clicked into my own skis and scooted up to a double chair called Livada, or “meadow” in Serbian. It rose lazily over an abandoned stone mansion called Stojko’s house, one of the few buildings that will remain. A man stood next to the entrance ready to check my lift ticket. I didn’t have one. I asked where to buy it.
“No, no, you don’t need a ticket,” said a voice in English behind me. I turned to see two men on skis. One of them in a red jacket shuffled forward, said something in Serbian and pressed <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3 worth</span> of coins into the attendant’s palm. “Come, come,” my new friend said, and off we went.
Rexhep Krasniqi,<span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 58,</span> had fled <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Kosovo 23 years</span> ago as a refugee and now worked as a contractor in London. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">He had returned to ski with his younger brother, Isak, who had run a refugee camp in Macedonia before landing a job in finance.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Isak was now unemployed but not worried.</span> “We are good at surviving,” he said.
I spent most of the day skiing with the Krasniqis, who explained the ticket system. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">A price list said I could buy anything from a single ride <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 10 days</span> of unlimited rides, but almost no one consulted it.</span> Instead they negotiated rates with the attendant. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">A single ride cost <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3.25,</span> though Rexhep had bargained to get both of us at least two rides for that.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">As best as I could tell a day pass cost <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $11.</span>
Now, new for this winter, workers have installed an electronic ticket-reader and day passes have jumped to <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $21,</span> a fortune when the average worker earns <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $380 a</span> month.</span> “No more corruption,” a local told me later, “but less skiers.”
We picked our way through a steep notch called the Lion’s Gate and found untracked lines through the trees. Wind-powered snow roared off the ridge behind us in great white flames. The snow hissed violently off the bottoms of my skis to form blue contrails. Most of the terrain was intermediate to expert-only. The revamped resort will have more beginner runs.
Eventually we stopped for lunch on a patio at a slopeside hut called Cafe Collmar, where a waiter brought us coffee, brandy and cheesy bread. Rexhep refused to let me pay <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $5 bill</span>. “No Albanian in Kosovo will ever let you pay,” he said, politely but firmly. “You are American, and to us Americans are like Jesuses.”
My last day dawned a piercing blue and the air shimmered with suspended snow crystals. This time Igor and a friend from Belgrade, Marko Nikolic, showed me a wild backcountry run that dropped through miles of open powder into a tight stream bed. Marko, a mountain guide, then invited me to climb to a high point in the resort,<span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,274</span>-foot Pribreg mountain, where we could find the longest, most challenging runs back to the base.
We rode Livada up as high as it went, then I slung my skis over my shoulder and kicked steps up the sastrugi beyond the top station. We gained an easy ridge and made the summit <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 45 minutes</span>. A lift once came all the way up here but it hadn’t worked in years, and the top wheelhouse was completely entombed in tons of feathered ice. The slope below was so steep it gave me vertigo.
Soon all of this would be very different. I tried to picture a brand-new lift stitched into the rock, the sprawling village where Tina’s once stood, and the legs I’d need to ski all those new runs. I had one foot in Macedonia, the other in Kosovo, and five more countries in view.
It may have been selfish, but Brezovica felt perfect as is. We have so many polished resorts already but so few that can foster skiing at its most authentic without any flash. Even more selfish: What do you do when you know one of your favorite places to visit, a secret, is about to blow up? Don’t you long for it to stay the way it is?
Brezovica has to change, of course. As anyone in Kosovo knows, stop moving for long enough and someone will come bury you.
Marko wasted no time. He strapped on his snowboard. I lowered my goggles. Then we both pushed off and floated through a beautiful, broken world.
IF YOU GO
Getting There
Pristina (PRN) and Skopje (SKP) are the closest airports to Brezovica. There are no direct flights to either city from the United States. Check fares on Turkish Airlines, Swiss, Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, SAS, EasyJet, Delta, Alitalia and Norwegian for connecting in Europe.
What You Should Know
This winter will likely be the last to see Brezovica in all of its rundown glory. In its current state, the resort is not for everyone. The lifts may not run every day. There is no such thing as customer service. It’s unclear what facilities will be open next winter. For updates check the Sar Planina-Brezovica Facebook page or the Brezovica Resort Facebook page. The ski area also has a website but it isn’t very helpful: brezovica-ski.com.
Guides
Hiring a guide to help you find a place to stay and arrange airport transfers is a must at the moment. Igor Nikolcevic is neither a guide nor an outfitter but he speaks very good English and can help arrange transfers, especially from Pristina, lift tickets, guides and lodging. Message him through the Pizzeria Tina Facebook page. Outdoor Albania, an outfitter based in Tirana, also runs custom trips to Brezovica. (OutdoorAlbania.com; info@outdooralbania.com).
Transfers and Lift Tickets
Expect to pay <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 50 euros</span> each way for transfers from Pristina. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Lift tickets now cost €20 a day.</span>",,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,4,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,

DealBook Briefing: Does Facebook Have Room for More Than One Founder?
Good Thursday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)
Founders may think twice about selling to Facebook
Selling your start-up to Facebook will make you rich, but it might not make you happy. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, who sold Instagram to the social networking giant for <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $715 million</span>, resigned earlier this week, reportedly over tensions with Mark Zuckerberg about growth.
Brian Acton, one of the co-founders who sold WhatsApp to Facebook <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $22 billion</span>, went further. In a dishy interview with Forbes, he spoke of similar tensions with Mr. Zuckerberg. (Facebook wanted ads; he didn’t.)
“They are businesspeople, they are good businesspeople,” Mr. Acton said. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">“They just represent a set of business practices, principles and ethics, and policies that I don’t necessarily agree with.”
</span>A senior Facebook executive, David Marcus, pushed back against Mr. Acton, writing in a post that “attacking the people and company that made you a billionaire” is “a whole new standard of low-class.”
Yes, founders take their money and make a choice. But Facebook’s acquisition strategy appears to be stuttering, and its newer products may head in unexpected directions with their founders out of the picture. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">That’s a problem: Facebook’s acquisitions have been oases of calm and growth compared to its main business.
</span>SoftBank’s founder has the biggest dreams in tech
Masa Son has raised <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $100 billion</span> for his company’s Vision Fund to invest in tech companies, on what he says is a 300-year strategy. But in a Bloomberg Businessweek profile, he says that’s only the start: He wants to raise <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another $100 billion</span> every two or three years, and expand the Vision Fund’s team of deal makers <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 300.</span> Counting him, it’s currently ten.
That’s an incredible amount of money, and competing investment firms are (understandably) frightened. It’s very different at start-ups, Businessweek points out:
SoftBank has given them the equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet of foreign investment dollars. “You think they can’t eat any more,” says Jules Maltz, a partner with IVP, a Sand Hill Road firm. The entrepreneurs “cram it in, put it in their pockets, take doggy bags, whatever.”
The bigger worry might be to SoftBank’s investors: The Vision Fund will need a lot of home-run investments to cover bets that huge.
Silicon Valley tells lawmakers to go easy on regulation
Executives from Google, Apple, AT&T and more appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee yesterday to answer privacy questions. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“We have arrived at a moment where, I believe, there is a strong desire by both Republicans and Democrats, and by both industry and public interest groups, to work in good faith to reach a consensus on a national consumer data privacy law,” Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the committee’s chairman, said in an opening statement.
</span>But a clear message emerged from the tech giants: Don’t go too far.
• Amazon’s associate general counsel, Andrew DeVore, asked lawmakers to “ensure that additional overhead and administration demands any legislation might require actually produce commensurate privacy benefits.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">• Keith Enright, Google’s new chief privacy officer, told them to “take into consideration the impacts on service functionality, the consumer benefits of free and low-cost products, the future of the open web and app ecosystem.”
</span>Nothing will happen quickly. “I think we might have a pretty good idea what a draft would look like,” Mr. Thune concluded. “But I suspect we probably wouldn’t get it acted on until next year.”

Coming up today
The Senate Judiciary Committee will hear from Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford. Dr. Blasey, who accused the Supreme Court nominee of sexual assault, will testify first, starting <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 10 a</span>.m. Eastern. Judge Kavanaugh is also expected to be questioned about accusations from other women, including one who came forward yesterday.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Steven Mnuchin might talk trade.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The Treasury secretary, who has kept a low profile recently, is scheduled to speak at a Washington event sponsored by The Hill.
</span>The Commerce Department will release second-quarter G.D.P. data. Analysts expect <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 4.2 percent</span> annualized growth rate.
The Census Bureau will publish durable goods order numbers for August. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">They are forecast to have risen <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 1.2 percent</span>, having <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fallen 1.7 percent</span> in July because of shrinking demand for transportation equipment.
</span>Fox admits defeat over Sky
Twenty-First Century Fox agreed yesterday to sell <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 39 percent</span> stake in the British broadcaster to Comcast <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $15 billion</span>. It’s the end of a monthslong battle, and of a yearslong quest by Rupert Murdoch to regain control of a company he created decades ago.
Fox is selling at the behest of Walt Disney, which struck a deal over the summer to buy most of Mr. Murdoch’s media empire.
Elizabeth Winkler of Heard on the Street says it’<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $15 billion</span> for Disney to spend on its fight with Netflix. But for Comcast shareholders, it’s <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another $15 billion</span> spent on an asset that many didn’t want in the first place.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Fed stands up to Trump
It raised interest rates as expected yesterday, to <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2 and</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.25 percent</span>, citing a “particularly bright moment” for the U.S. economy.</span> President Trump said he was “not happy.”
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">So he shows no sign of returning to the tradition of presidential silence on fiscal policy.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But the Fed still plans another increase before the end of the year, and some of its officials reckon avoiding inflation will require raising rates to the point of restricting the economy.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">For his part, Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chief, said yesterday: “We don’t consider political factors.”
</span>For Nike, Kaepernick is an existential choice
The sportswear company’s decision to feature Colin Kaepernick in its latest ads has been celebrated as shrewd marketing. But Nike nearly dropped the former N.F.L. quarterback after he became the face of player protests.
Then its communications chief, Nigel Powell, intervened, report Julie Creswell, Kevin Draper and Sapna Maheshwari in the NYT:
Powell argued that Nike would face backlash from the media and consumers if it was seen as siding with the N.F.L. rather than Kaepernick. And Nike, along with most apparel companies, is desperate to attract urban youth who increasingly look up to Kaepernick; the largely white, older N.F.L. fans angry at the league over the protests are not a priority for those companies, analysts say.
Another factor: Under Nike’s latest deal with the N.F.L., it can’t sell league-branded merchandise <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 2020.</span> That helped it choose to put Mr. Kaepernick front and center. So far, the wager is paying off.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Could Treasuries end the bull market?
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The stock market may face a new threat: increasingly attractive returns on government bonds.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">More from Peter Eavis of DealBook:
Buying a 10-year Treasury today would provide its holders <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 3 percent</span> a year for a decade with virtually no risk of losing any money in the process.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Such a return might seem particularly attractive to investors who believe the stock market is expensive and is vulnerable to a sell-off.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">And:
If companies’ profits continue to grow strongly, the earnings yield will rise and stocks will look more attractive compared with government bonds.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">But corporate earnings growth is expected to slow next year.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">And the trade war may cause corporate profits to moderate even more.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">In that case, the difference between the 10-year yield and the earnings yield would shrink even more.</span> Investors may be more tempted then to shed stocks and put more money into bonds.

I believed in traditional reporting, but Trump changed me — and it should change the rest of the media too.
Perspective by Margaret Sullivan
<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 12,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2022 at</span> 10:00 a.m. EDT
Despite my nearly four decades in journalism, I was unprepared for the moment of no return that came on a July day <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span></span> as a blazing sun beat down on the streets of Cleveland. Walking around the grounds of the Republican National Convention, I was looking for a column idea. I was new at this, having started at The Washington Post only a few weeks earlier. Wandering and observing, I came upon a table of souvenirs, meant to appeal to the convention attendees who had arrived from all corners of the nation to cheer on the Republican Party’s nomination of Donald Trump. I already had seen some gleefully misogynistic anti-Clinton paraphernalia — “Hillary sucks but not like Monica” — but nothing measured up to the horror I felt as I registered the meaning of a T-shirt featuring the image of a noose and these words: “Rope. Tree. Journalist. Some assembly required.”
Over the weeks and months ahead, as I started to write what I hoped were well-reasoned Post columns about Trump’s relationship with the media, I felt an irrational anger coming at me like an unending blast from an industrial-strength hose. Trump hadn’t invented this anger, of course, but he certainly emboldened it — and used it for his own purposes. On social media, in phone messages, in emails I received, the sheer hatred from Trump supporters shocked and even frightened me. One, unsigned but from a “lifetime member of the NRA,” asserted that people like me wouldn’t be around much longer. Another, signed “A Real, True Patriot,” read:
“Though I would never read a manure-laden pile of toilet paper like Washington Compost, I heard about your Nazi column about ‘reaching the masses’ with your fake news to convince people that your leftist Nazi lies are truth. You are a well-trained serpent of the left, following communist orders as you were taught. ‘If you say and repeat a lie often enough, it will eventually be seen as truth’ — Lenin … Here’s what you (slithering, fake-news/propaganda- generating slimy slug) should do: Go fornicate yourself with a large, sharp knife, and then eat rat poison until your belly is stuffed.”
I was called the c-word repeatedly. One reader suggested I have my breasts cut off. I tried to let all this nastiness roll off my back and even found it amusing when a Post reader sent me an email calling me a “venomous serpent.” John Schwartz, then a reporter for the New York Times who had become a friend, suggested I treat it as a badge of honor and write a book titled “Memories of a Venomous Serpent.”
Now, six years later, we journalists know a lot more about covering Trump and his supporters. We’ve come a long way, but certainly made plenty of mistakes. Too many times, we acted as his stenographers or megaphones. Too often, we failed to refer to his many falsehoods as lies. It took too long to stop believing that, whenever he calmed down for a moment, he was becoming “presidential.” And it took too long to moderate our instinct to give equal weight to both sides, even when one side was using misinformation for political gain.
It’s been an education for all of us — a gradual realization that the instincts and conventions of traditional journalism weren’t good enough for this moment in our country’s history. As Trump prepares to run again <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2024,</span> it’s worth reminding ourselves of the lessons we’ve learned — and committing to the principle that, when covering politicians who are essentially running against democracy, old-style journalism will no longer suffice.
Back <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span></span></span> I was still looking for common ground with the Trump crowd. It fit with my background as a traditional newspaper journalist. During <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 13 years</span> as chief editor of the Buffalo News, ending <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> I had believed that I could listen to or communicate with our readers, whatever their politics — and I was registered to vote as a “blank.” Our editorial board, which I sat on, endorsed candidates from various parties, and I had courteous relationships with officeholders of all stripes. I frequently would go out to speak to civic organizations, such as rotary clubs, in the Buffalo-Niagara region with no regard for whether their members leaned right or left.
At the Cleveland airport after the convention, I interviewed one delegate, a concierge for a car dealership named Mary Sue McCarty, who wore a cowboy hat and pearls as she waited for her flight home to Dallas. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">She had her mind made up about the news media: “Journalists aren’t doing their jobs.</span> They are protecting a certain class.” <span id=""1"" class=""red"">When I pointed out that it was the New York Times that broke the consequential story about Hillary Clinton’s email practices and that mainstream media organizations had aggressively investigated the finances of the Clinton Foundation, she shrugged: “If it’s a Republican, it’s investigated to death.</span> If it’s a Democrat, it’s breezed over.”
This assertion could hardly have been more wrong. After all, the media’s endless emphasis on Clinton’s emails would prove to be a big factor in dooming her campaign. It simply wasn’t the case that the press was giving Democrats a pass.
Clearly, the empirical common ground I depended upon — and believed in — was eroding. Dealing with that growing reality over the next few years would change me as a journalist and even as a person. Some principles and beliefs, I found, were more important than appearing to get along with everyone or responding to criticism by offering to compromise or change course. Journalists have to stand, unwaveringly, for the truth — and if that meant being attacked by zealots who wanted to call such a position evidence of bias, I could live with that. For me, it would soon become a matter of simple integrity to acknowledge that some of the old-school rules and practices didn’t work anymore.

From this new vantage point, it seemed self-evident that the mainstream press was too often going easy on Trump. Well into his presidency, journalists didn’t want to use the word “lie” for Trump’s constant barrage of falsehoods. To lie, editors reasoned, means to intend to be untruthful. Since journalists couldn’t be inside politicians’ heads, how were we supposed to know if — by this definition — they were really lying? The logic eventually became strained, given that Trump blithely repeated the same rank mistruths over and over.
Too many reporters and their editors didn’t seem to want to figure out how to cover Trump properly. From the moment he descended the golden escalator at Manhattan’s Trump Tower in <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2015 to</span> announce his candidacy, the news media was in his thrall. Journalists couldn’t stop writing about him, showing him on TV and even broadcasting images of the empty stage waiting for him to arrive at a rally. Trump had described himself as “the ratings machine,” and for once he wasn’t exaggerating.
As I continued to tackle <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 campaign</span>, I criticized the press’s obsession with the former reality-TV star, yet I was caught up in it, too. I have no regrets about what I wrote, but I certainly was aware that if I wrote a column with Trump’s name in the headline, it probably would find a passionate audience: thousands of comments and retweets, hundreds of emails, requests to talk on TV. And because I wrote about the news media, and Trump never stopped using the news media as a foil, there was so much to say.
In every way, Trump was a deeply abnormal candidate, but the news media couldn’t seem to communicate that effectively or even grasp the problem. Instead, his every unhinged, middle-of-the-night tweet was covered like legitimate news. To be fair, the media was applying a standard that had made sense up until that moment: When a major presidential candidate says something provocative or worse, it’s newsworthy. The problem is that we were applying this old standard to a candidate who was exploiting it for his own purposes — while seeking to undermine democracy itself.

In the late afternoon of Nov.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016,</span> Election Day, I walked into The Post’s newsroom with a column already started about Hillary Clinton’s supposedly inevitable victory. A few hours later, I was scrambling, just like every reporter, editor and commentator. My colleagues and I watched the television screens placed all around the newsroom as one battleground state after another fell to Trump.
Tossing away my useless column, I wrote that the media coverage of <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2016 race</span> had been, as I put it, “an epic fail.” <span id=""2"" class=""red"">They — and I would include myself in this criticism — employed a kind of magical thinking: A Trump presidency shouldn’t happen, therefore it won’t happen.
</span>Soon, word filtered down from the boss, Marty Baron, that I should produce a second column before I left the newsroom that night. He wanted me to write my recommendations for how the traditional press should cover the new president. So, I wrote a call to arms for American journalists: “Journalists are going to have to be better — stronger, more courageous, stiffer-spined — than they’ve ever been.” I filed it, not at all convinced that I’d written anything worthwhile on this momentous night, said good night to my editor and headed out of the newsroom <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 3 a</span>.m.
Stunned and spent, I walked slowly through the deserted streets of downtown Washington. As I neared my apartment, I could see the U.S. Capitol, that seemingly inviolable symbol of American democracy, off to the east. Lit from within, it glowed an ethereal white in the darkness.
In every way, Trump was a deeply abnormal candidate, but the news media couldn’t seem to communicate that effectively or even grasp the problem.
As we would learn over the coming years, the Capitol was not inviolable, and neither is the democracy it represents. American democracy is now on the edge of a precipice. What can members of the press do to help keep it from tipping over as <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2024 campaign</span> looms? What should we have learned since that summer in 2016?
For one thing, I’m convinced that journalists — specifically those who cover politics — must keep a sharp focus on truth-seeking, not old-style performative neutrality. Does that mean we throw objectivity out the window? Of course not. We should be resolutely objective in the sense of seeking evidence and approaching subjects with an open mind. We should not, however, resort to taking everything down the middle, no matter what. Rather than, for example, having equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats (or conservatives and progressives) on every talk show, or devoting equal numbers of words to each side of a political argument, we should be thinking about what coverage serves the public best.
Those who deny the outcome of <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span></span> certainly don’t deserve a media megaphone for that enduring lie, one that is likely to reemerge in the presidential campaign ahead. But the media should go one step further: When covering such a politician in other contexts — for example, about abortion rights or gun control — journalists should remind audiences that this public figure is an election denier.
That’s exactly the model pursued by WITF, a public radio station in Harrisburg, Pa., which decided to remind its audience on a regular basis that some Republican state legislators and members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation had opposed the transfer of power to Joe Biden, despite the lack of evidence to support their claims of election fraud. A story on the station’s website about a state legislator’s efforts to get Pennsylvanians vaccinated was accompanied by a sidebar of text about his behavior after the election. On-air stories have used a tagline to accomplish the same purpose. The decision wasn’t easy, one editor told me, “because this is not the normal thing.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Advertisement
Unfortunately, many media organizations — increasingly owned these days by huge corporations or hedge funds — seem more interested in ratings and profits than in serving the public interest.</span> So, they are extremely hesitant to offend groups of viewers or voters, including the many Republicans who have signed on to the lie about <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 election</span></span> being stolen. The new boss of CNN, Chris Licht, raised eyebrows when he made the rounds on Capitol Hill a few months ago to assure Republican leaders that members of their party would be treated fairly on the network that had been one of the former president’s favorite punching bags. One conservative publication, the Washington Free Beacon, called Licht’s unusual outreach an “apology tour.” Given all this, it’s difficult to picture CNN consistently alerting viewers that a politician is an election denier, even when discussing a different subject. Yet that’s exactly the type of bold measure that is needed.
Media people — not just reporters but their editors and top leaders of newsrooms — also need to take a hard, critical look at the types of stories that constitute traditional campaign coverage. That coverage has historically leaned on such things as live footage of speeches, rallies and debates; on “horse race” articles based on polls or conventional wisdom; and on blowing up small conflicts (campaign staff in disarray!) into major stories. These modes of coverage can have the effect of normalizing a candidate who should not be normalized. They also often constitute a distraction at a time when huge swaths of one party are essentially running against democratic practices.
By no means am I counseling that journalists act as if they are “on the team” of Trump’s rivals. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">That’s not our job.</span> At the same time, we have to be aware that covering someone who doesn’t care about democratic norms — even something as basic as the peaceful transfer of power — requires different judgments about what stories really matter, and how we should or should not cover them.
In making these judgments, we have to relentlessly explain ourselves to our readers, viewers and listeners. Although it didn’t involve Trump, a good example of this came over the summer when the Plain Dealer newspaper in Cleveland decided against covering a rally for U.S. Senate candidate J.D. Vance featuring Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis because of the absurdly restrictive rules the campaign had tried to impose, including a prohibition against interviewing attendees who weren’t approved by rally organizers. Instead, the Plain Dealer published white space, with a note to readers written by editor Chris Quinn headlined, “We reject the free speech-trampling rules set by J.D. Vance and Ron DeSantis for covering their rally.” Quinn was blunt: “Think about what they were doing here. They were staging an event to rally people to vote for Vance while instituting the kinds of policies you’d see in a fascist regime.”
Of course, the press must be just as tough on Democrats, should they adopt similar tactics or start lying all the time or trashing governmental norms. The standards should be the same for all. But journalists shouldn’t shy away from the unavoidable truth: Most of this is coming from Trump-style Republicans.
Perhaps the most important thing journalists can do as they cover the campaign ahead is to provide thoughtful framing and context. They shouldn’t just repeat what’s being said, but help explain what it means. This is especially important in headlines and news alerts, which are about as far as many news consumers get. When Trump rants about the supposed horrors of rigged elections and voting fraud, journalists have to constantly provide the counterweight of truth. We have gotten better at this <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2016.</span> Now we have to stick to it.
All of these suggestions go against the grain of traditional politics coverage. Undoubtedly, this approach will draw accusations of bias from the right; undoubtedly, journalists and news leaders will be put on the defensive. They’ll need to get over that. The stakes are enormously high. Doing things the same old way isn’t remotely appropriate. By now, that’s something we all should have learned.

Sitting before a parliamentary oversight committee last month, two top executives from Tanzania Petroleum Development Corp. declined to reveal details of billions of dollars in gas contracts that the state company had signed with foreign investors. Parliamentarians had a sharp riposte: They called the police.

The two company board members had argued they needed permission from their investors before they disclosed details of the deal. But soon after a police officer showed up, the executives were fumbling with their paperwork, according to lawmakers who attended the hearing—but in the end, they didn’t release any documents.

The executives were escorted out of the parliamentary building and into a police truck. They were briefly taken into custody, detained for a few hours and released without charges.

“Companies must accept the era of secrecy is over,” says Zitto Kabwe, the head of the Tanzanian parliament’s public-accounts committee, who witnessed the scene.

TPDC declined to comment on the police detention of its executives, and Tanzania’s ministry of energy and minerals didn’t respond to requests for comment.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Battles over contract transparency are brewing across Africa, touching on sensitive tax issues among energy and mineral giants trying to tap into a new frontier of the global economy.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The clashes show how once-malleable African governments are fighting for a bigger share of earnings in sometimes-secretive deals, often following the advice of Western groups such as the Soros Foundation and the African Governance Initiative, which is headed by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

</span>The upshot: A raft of legal disputes that have stalled production of some key projects and frayed relationships between African governments and foreign investors.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Uganda remains embroiled in a litany of tax disputes with Tullow Oil PLC and Heritage Oil Corp., nearly a decade after oil reserves were discovered.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The country had amended its income-tax law to introduce a capital-gains tax on the sale of oil rights shortly after the discoveries, prompting Heritage and Tullow to contest the new tax assessments.

</span>Zambia’s mining industry is faltering after the government in October decided to more than triple mine royalties <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 20%,</span> following the advice of Western groups. This compelled miners such as First Quantum Minerals Ltd. and Glencore PLC to <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">suspend $2 billion</span> in expansion projects.

And in Guinea, disputes stemming from government changes to a lease for the Simandou iron-ore mine are dogging the project.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Some experts argue the disputes reveal a blurring between demands for more disclosure from investors and more tax revenue from governments.</span> “It’s about negotiating to get a better deal in terms of money ... <span id=""9"" class=""red"">income, but not necessarily transparency,” says Carlos Lopes, the chief of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.

</span>African governments have found ready partners for both endeavors. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Western organizations such as the Soros Foundation, founded by hedge-fund billionaire George Soros, and international institutions like the United Nations and the World Bank are providing advisory services to resource-rich nations on how to adjust ownership structures and rejigger tax laws for a bigger slice of revenues.

</span>Some analysts say this is a necessary tilting of the scales toward African governments.

“The deals often favor the companies which have access to vast experience and capital, while the governments do not have the experience, institutions or laws in place to manage their natural resources,” says George Boden, an analyst with U.K.-based anticorruption group Global Witness.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The African Governance Initiative—headed by Mr. Blair—has helped Rwanda become the region’s first country to issue mining certificates at the point of export, in an effort to keep conflict minerals out of the supply chain.

</span>In Guinea, Mr. Soros, through his foundations, played a key role in advising the government on its review of mining deals struck by previous governments. This led to the ouster of BSG Resources, the mining arm of Israeli tycoon Beny Steinmetz’s family-owned conglomerate, from the country earlier this year and the ushering in of Rio Tinto PLC.

Mr. Steinmetz has since sued Global Witness—partly funded by the Soros Foundation—which accused his company of obtaining mining rights in the country through corruption. BSG also is in international arbitration with Guinea in a bid to win compensation for being stripped of the Simandou mine. BSG Resources has denied wrongdoing and accused President Alpha Condé’s government of seeking to expropriate its rights by stealth—a claim the government rejects.

Simandou’s current operator Rio Tinto has also sued rival Vale SA and Mr. Steinmetz, alleging that they colluded to rob the Anglo-Australian company of the highly prized iron-ore concession, further complicating the legal battles around the mine. Both parties denied Rio Tinto’s allegations, which a BSG Resources spokesman called “baseless and bizarre.”

In Tanzania, the recent police detention of the oil-company executives capped months of a simmering row at the local parliament over whether the East African nation is getting a fair deal for its newfound vast natural-gas resources.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Mr. Kabwe’s fight to make all contracts public kicked off in August, when part of the contract with Norway’s Statoil ASA and ExxonMobil Corp. was leaked to the local press, showing that the state-run Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation, or TPDC, had agreed to terms yielding 30%-50% of the revenue for state coffers—well below the 50%-80% yields recommended by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

</span>Tanzania <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009 signed</span> the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, an effort led by non-governmental organizations to bring contracts to light. Though most of Africa’s other mineral-rich nations also are signatories, implementation has been uneven.

Mr. Kabwe, who heads the parliament’s public-accounts committee, ordered TPDC to bring all contracts to parliament for scrutiny, but the state-run company cited investor reluctance to publicize the terms. It didn’t comply with a Nov.<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 deadline</span>—at which point the two senior TPDC board members were briefly taken into custody.

An official with TPDC said that confidentiality clauses in the deals prevent the state company from revealing them to third parties.

ExxonMobil, the minority partner in the venture, referred questions to Statoil. Knut Rostad, a spokesman for Statoil, said the deal was “balanced and comparable to commercial terms in other places with similar risks.” He added that his company was making a long-term commitment to the country and has already spent <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $1.5 billion</span> on exploration.

But Mr. Rostad said he wouldn’t comment on parliamentary debates or police detention of TPDC executives. He confirmed his company didn’t release the contracts but declined to answer why, given the demands of the Tanzanian parliament.

611132b18e9901b4cf5d24a6,30538,"<h3>The Website That Shows How a Free Press Can Die</h3>BUDAPEST — Hungary’s leading news website, Origo, had a juicy scoop: A top aide to the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, had used state money to pay for sizable but unexplained expenses during secret foreign trips. The story embarrassed Mr. Orban and was a reminder that his country still had an independent press.
But that was <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span> Today, Origo is one of the prime minister’s most dutiful media boosters, parroting his attacks on migrants and on George Soros, the Hungarian-American philanthropist demonized by the far right on both sides of the Atlantic.
And if Origo once dug into Mr. Orban’s government, it now pounces on his political opponents.
“Let’s look at the affairs of Laszlo Botka!” a headline blared earlier this month in a salacious take on the only mayor of a major Hungarian city not aligned with Mr. Orban’s party, Fidesz. “Serious scandals, mysteries surround the socialist mayor of Szeged.”
If little known outside Hungary, Origo is now a cautionary tale for an age in which democratic norms and freedom of expression are being challenged globally — and President Trump and other leaders have intensified attacks on the free press.
In many ways, Hungary has foreshadowed the democratic backsliding now evident in different corners of the world. Since winning power <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span></span></span> Mr. Orban has steadily eroded institutional checks and balances, especially the independent media. His government now oversees state-owned news outlets, while his allies control most of the country’s private media sources, creating a virtual echo chamber for Mr. Orban’s far right, anti-immigrant views.
The story of Origo’s transformation from independent news source to government cheerleader offers a blueprint of how Mr. Orban and his allies pulled this off. Rather than a sudden and blatant power grab, the effort was subtle but determined, using a quiet pressure campaign.
Origo’s editors were never imprisoned and its reporters were never beaten up. But in secret meetings — including a pivotal one in Vienna — the website’s original owner, a German-owned telecommunications company, relented. The company, Magyar Telekom, first tried self-censorship. Then it sought a nonpartisan buyer.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">But, ultimately, Origo went to the family of Mr. Orban’s former finance minister.
</span>“When Orban came to power <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span></span></span> his aim was to eliminate the media’s role as a check on government,” said Attila Mong, a former public radio anchor and a critic of Mr. Orban. “Orban wanted to introduce a regime which keeps the facade of democratic institutions but is not operated in a democratic manner — and a free press doesn’t fit into that picture.”
On the surface, Hungary’s democratic institutions seem to be operating normally. The judiciary is nominally independent. Elections are held. Newsstands are stacked with dozens of private publications.
“We would never sink so low,” Mr. Orban said in a September speech, “as to silence those with whom we disagree.”
But below the surface, the system has been degraded. The Constitutional Court is stacked with judges appointed by Fidesz. The judiciary and the prosecution service are headed by two of Mr. Orban’s oldest supporters. Both the electoral system and the electoral map have been altered to favor Mr. Orban’s party.
Other than a handful of mainly online outlets, the Hungarian media has been either silent about or supportive of these moves.
According to Freedom House’s press freedom index, Hungary’s media was judged the 87th freest in the world <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span></span> down from joint 40th <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010,</span></span></span> when Mr. Orban entered office.
The index now labels Hungarian media as only “partly free,” while Hungary’s wider political system, once classified as a “consolidated democracy,” has been downgraded to “semi-consolidated democracy.”
And the fate of Origo, Mr. Mong said, is “very symbolic” of that transition.
A Secret Meeting
<span id=""1"" class=""red""><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span></span> Origo was Hungary’s most-read news website, renowned for its hard-nosed investigations into the likes of Lajos Simicska, a friend of Mr. Orban who had long financed his party.
</span>By then, Mr. Orban’s appointees controlled the state media, as well as Hungary’s two main media regulators. He had given regulators more power to fine and punish independent news outlets, or to drive them off air, yet Origo did not seem cowed.
The site had been created in the late 1990s by Magyar Telekom, the country’s leading telecoms company, to lure subscribers to its fledgling internet service. Over time, though, Origo evolved into a journalistic force with its own identity.
But as Origo thrived, its parent company faced challenges.
Since the start of the cellphone era, Magyar Telekom had been Hungary’s leading telecommunications company. When Deutsche Telekom, the German telecoms giant which also owns T-Mobile, bought a majority stake in the company <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2005,</span> Magyar Telekom was considered a marquee purchase.
But things changed with Mr. Orban’s election <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">He levied an “emergency” tax on the telecoms sector, in a bid to reduce government debt after the global financial crisis.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The tax was also seen as part of a wider backlash against foreign firms that had bought up large sections of the Hungarian economy after the fall of communism.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">For Magyar Telekom, it meant an <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $100 million</span> tax bill.</span> Company executives feared more bad news <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span></span> when Mr. Orban’s government was due to renew its frequency licenses. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Ahead of a September deadline, negotiations would determine how much of the market would be assigned to Telekom, and at what price.
</span>The talks were not going well. Months before the deadline, René Obermann, Deutsche Telekom’s C.E.O., became embroiled in a shouting match with Mr. Orban at a private meeting in Germany, two people briefed on the exchange said.
Throughout the year, Magyar Telekom executives met with Janos Lazar, Mr. Orban’s second-in-command, to negotiate the license renewal and a multimillion-dollar contract to install broadband internet throughout rural Hungary. Initially, Origo was not a topic of discussion.
But that changed in the early summer at a secret meeting in Vienna between Mr. Lazar and two senior company executives, according to three people with knowledge of the discussion. Mr. Lazar said that Origo’s journalists had historically struggled to grasp the government’s perspective on certain matters and proposed a remedy: a secret line of communication between Origo’s editors and the highest levels of government.
Mr. Lazar was careful not to frame the request as a quid pro quo for new licenses, or as a form of censorship. But the Magyar Telekom executives took it seriously.
By autumn, Origo had signed a contract with a media consultancy run by Attila Varhegyi, the former director of Mr. Orban’s party. As a consultant, Mr. Varhegyi had played a major role in turning Hungarian state media into a mouthpiece for Mr. Orban and now his attention had pivoted to the private sector.
Under the deal, Mr. Varhegyi’s firm could call Origo’s editor with suggestions about coverage.
That same month, the government extended its license agreements with the country’s three mobile telephone operators.
Magyar Telekom was awarded the biggest share.
Both Magyar Telekom and its parent company declined to comment on the Vienna meeting and Mr. Varhegyi. But in a general statement, Magyar Telekom said: “Dialogue between the government in office and the management of Magyar Telekom is a matter of fact, but its aim has never been to limit publicity or the freedom of press.”
Mr. Varhegyi and Mr. Lazar turned down several interview requests and ignored requests for comment.
An Editor Fired
Outraged, Origo’s editor in chief resigned, refusing to participate in the deal. But his replacement, Gergo Saling, appeared undaunted.
By <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2014,</span> Mr. Saling’s team had even launched an investigation into Mr. Lazar’s foreign travel expenses. Requests by Mr. Varhegyi’s firm to slow the project down were ignored.
But Mr. Saling was living on borrowed time.
The investigation was embarrassing to Magyar Telekom: Mr. Lazar had overseen the company’s license renewal and discussions were still underway over the contract to install broadband in the countryside.
Mr. Lazar complained about the story in a meeting with two Magyar Telekom executives in <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2014,</span> according to two people with knowledge of the discussion, and his disapproval was quickly relayed to Origo’s management. It was one of several attempts by Magyar Telekom management, and Mr. Varhegyi’s firm, to sway the investigation, both before and after the broadband deal was announced later that month, according to four people familiar with the controversy.
Undeterred, Mr. Saling’s journalists continued to scrutinize Mr. Lazar’s travel. They eventually began court proceedings to request specific travel records, and published several embarrassing stories about the minister’s movements.
But by the start of summer, Mr. Saling’s superiors had run out of patience. Mr. Orban had won re-election in April. Mr. Saling was fired in early June, nominally by mutual agreement.
The decision was ultimately made by Miklos Vaszily, Origo’s chief executive. But it came only after months of pressure on Mr. Vaszily from Magyar Telekom’s management and Mr. Varhegyi’s firm, according to three people at the company.
In protest, several of Origo’s best reporters resigned.
For Magyar Telekom, Origo had become a public relations liability and a political hindrance, and executives wanted to sell.
Flush With Government Cash
<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Throughout 2014,</span> Magyar Telekom held talks with prospective buyers but decided against a private sale. The Lazar scandal had caused a public outcry, as critics accused the company of bending to political pressure. Executives wanted the deal to be beyond reproach, so an open bidding process was announced in <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2015 and</span> overseen by Ernst and Young, an international accountancy firm.
The winner was named in November 2015: a firm called New Wave Media, which outbid two rival companies.
New Wave’s profile immediately raised eyebrows. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Their bid was financed by funds controlled by two banks, one owned by Mr. Orban’s government, and another owned by Tamas Szemerey, a cousin of one of Mr. Orban’s former ministers.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">In addition, New Wave was part-owned by Mr. Szemerey’s longtime business partner, company records show.
</span>Mr. Szemerey had made earlier attempts to buy Origo directly. But by his own telling, Magyar Telekom executives had discouraged such a direct attempt, on the grounds that he would be perceived as too close to the government.
Yet Mr. Szemerey ended up helping to pay for Origo all the same.
There was no evidence of favoritism: New Wave had simply made the highest bid. But bolstered by money from the state, New Wave could afford to pay whatever it took to avoid the outlet being sold to businesses not aligned with the government.
“We did not want it in the hands of Soros, or in the hands of people outside Hungary, or people who wanted to influence Hungarian politics against the Hungarian government,” Mr. Szemerey said in an interview.
Magyar Telekom and Deutsche Telekom declined to comment on Mr. Szemerey’s contacts with Telekom officials, but said the deal had been conducted transparently.
Though nominally still private, Origo now became a vessel for the government. Bought in part with government money, Origo now published news that echoed the government’s stance — in particular on migration, Mr. Soros, and the European Union, whose officials have frequently criticized Mr. Orban.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Before, Origo had struggled financially.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Now it was flush with government advertising revenue, which more than tripled following the sale.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red""><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2017,</span></span> the son of Mr. Orban’s former finance minister became New Wave’s CEO and government advertising revenues kept rising, even as Origo’s coverage became even more aggressively pro-Orban.
</span>At the time, <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2015 sale</span> of Origo could have been considered an outlier. Then, Origo became one of <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 31 outlets</span> owned by Mr. Orban’s allies, according to research by Atlatszo, an investigative news website.

611132b18e9901b4cf5d24a6,49862,"<h3>Analysis | AT&T’s ill-fated media play cost it both time and money</h3>AT&T today is a less valuable, more heavily indebted company than it was <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016 when</span> it announced plans to acquire Time Warner and create a media-communications colossus that would dazzle consumers and shower investors with riches.
Now AT&T’s leadership is back with a new plan: unwinding the deal it once touted as “the model that wins over time.” The company said last week it would spin off its WarnerMedia unit in a <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">complex $43 billion</span> deal that unites it with Discovery Inc. in a new publicly-traded entity.
John Stankey, AT&T’s chief executive, called the company’s latest transformative transaction “an opportunity to unlock value” — leaving unanswered the question of who had locked up the value in the first place.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">While AT&T insists its Time Warner acquisition has paid off financially, many analysts said the telecommunications giant <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">squandered $100 billion</span> on a dalliance with the media and entertainment worlds that could have been better spent elsewhere.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">“Telecom companies have no business whatsoever buying assets that are outside their core expertise,” said Allyn Arden, director at S&P Global Corporate Ratings.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“This was a business they had no business being in.”
AT&T’s pursuit of a comprehensive telecom-media-entertainment strategy certainly left investors unimpressed.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The phone company’s share price barely advanced during a period when stocks more than doubled in value.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">From the announcement of Time Warner’s acquisition to word of its spinoff, shares of AT&T gained <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 12.6 percent</span> compared to <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 112.7 percent</span> increase in the S&<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500.</span>
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The company’s market capitalization — the value of all its outstanding stock — has fallen by <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 percent</span> since the end <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2016,</span> according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">After bingeing on debt — and eliminating <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 45,000 jobs</span> — AT&T confronts a future as the nation’s third-largest provider of wireless services and the No.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 broadband</span> company.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">AT&T’s latest reinvention also is bad news for many retail shareholders.</span> The company has long paid a generous dividend, attracting legions of mom-and-pop investors seeking dependable retirement payouts.
But shedding WarnerMedia will shrink annual dividends by nearly half, from <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $15 billion</span> to between <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $8 billion</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $8.6 billion</span>, the company said.
AT&T shareholders will <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">own 71 percent</span> of the new Discovery, so they will benefit from its future growth. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">But many current AT&T investors didn’t sign up for the often bumpy ride of a media growth stock.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">They want reliable income.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">“A lot of holders of AT&T stock are interested in a dividend.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The stock is going to be a lot less attractive to that class of individual investors,” said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, senior counselor at the nonprofit Benton Institute for Broadband and Society.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">One sign of how widely felt AT&T’s cut will be: The Vanguard Group, which holds the company’s shares in dozens of its mutual funds, including the Total Stock Market Index Fund, the world’s largest single fund, is the company’s top shareholder.
</span>By AT&T’s calculations, it’s already made billions of dollars on its original Time Warner deal and expects to make even more through the union of Discovery’s reality television programming and WarnerMedia’s CNN, HBO and Warner Bros. Studios.
<span id=""13"" class=""red"">In the deal with Discovery, AT&T shareholders will get stock in the new company.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Based on Discovery’s stock price on <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 14,</span> the day before the transaction was disclosed, those shares would be <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth $59 billion</span></span>.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">AT&T will <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">get $43 billion</span> in cash, securities and WarnerMedia’s agreement to <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">retain $1.5 billion</span> of its debt.
</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">The telecom giant already has booked an <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $5 billion</span> by selling off WarnerMedia assets, including its stake in the streaming service Hulu, plus billions in cash it’s received from the business <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2018.</span>
</span>“We’re comfortably above <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $100 billion</span> total value we paid when we bought Time Warner,” said Fletcher Cook, AT&T’s vice president for corporate communications.
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">Yet Discovery’s stock has sagged <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 12 percent</span> since the deal was announced — and the transaction is not scheduled to close until the middle of next year — calling into question whether AT&T’s stake in the new Discovery is really <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">worth $59 billion</span></span>.
</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">AT&T’s math also doesn’t include the opportunity cost of <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spending $100 billion</span> on TimeWarner rather than alternatives, such as building out the wireless network needed for an Internet-of-things future.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Limited by the debt it had taken on in the original Time Warner deal, AT&T this year was outspent by Verizon nearly 2-to-1 when the federal government auctioned off mid-band spectrum for 5G networks.</span> As rival Verizon <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">committed $53 billion</span>, AT&T could muster <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only $27 billion</span> for a contest that will be critical to its future.
“If they didn’t have DirecTV and WarnerMedia, they would have gone full throttle on C-band and spent closer <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $50 billion</span>. They were hamstrung,” Arden said.
For AT&T, the about-face on WarnerMedia marks a significant strategic shift after decades of buying and selling other companies.
The corporate saga began <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1984,</span> when the original Bell system was split into the long distance provider AT&T and seven regional phone companies.
More than a decade later, after Congress passed landmark legislation designed to fuel competition among landline, wireless and media companies, AT&T began a series of acquisitions that slowly reassembled much of what had been broken up.
<span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2015,</span> it acquired DirecTV before announcing plans to snap up Time Warner the following year. That purchase was delayed when the Trump administration launched an unsuccessful legal challenge on antitrust grounds.
“AT&T has been an acquisition machine for decades. It’s been instrumental to their growth,” said Scott Cleland, president of Precursor, a research consultancy. “Eventually, that strategy ran out of gas.”
Many analysts say the company would have been better off never having gotten involved with Time Warner or DirecTV, the satellite operator it acquired <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 for</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $67 billion</span>. The strategy of owning both media and telecommunications businesses under a single corporate roof, they say, was ill-conceived.
“AT&T is probably getting out of this, at best, break-even or slightly better than that,” said David Barden, senior telecom analyst for Bank of America.
AT&T’s move comes just two weeks after Verizon unloaded its media assets, Yahoo and AOL, in <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $5 billion</span> sale to Apollo Global Management, a private equity firm. But Verizon’s media mistake was far less expensive: It spent <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just $9 billion</span> to acquire the two fading Internet-era stars <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 and</span><span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017,</span> at a fraction of what AT&T spent.
AT&T belatedly recognized that making a global success of HBO Max against fierce competition from Netflix and Disney Plus would have required daunting investments. Facing a choice between doubling down and getting out, the company blinked.
“They decided their core competency was connectivity not content,” said Barden, who thinks management made the right call.
As investors mulled the outlook for AT&T and the new Discovery-WarnerMedia combination, it was clear that AT&T has been forced to abandon its ambitious plans and retreat to its roots as a communications company.
Yet AT&T may finally have stumbled onto a promising strategy, as the Discovery deal addresses some of its acknowledged weaknesses. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Executives plan to devote all of <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $43 billion</span> raised by the WarnerMedia spinoff to shrinking the company’s debt load, which has grown <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $169 billion</span>.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">That should accelerate ongoing debt reduction efforts by one year and free up the company to increase spending on its wireless network and to more than double <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 30 million</span> homes its fiber broadband connections, executives said.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">In the short run, AT&T stock may be depressed as dividend-seeking retail investors sell.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">But eventually, professional fund managers who in the past have been underwhelmed by the company’s strategy and repelled by its high debt load will be attracted to the new plan, Barden said.
</span>“AT&T bit off more than they could chew,” said Jeff Kagan, an industry consultant. “But it remains a powerful, strong company.”",,,,,,,,1,,,,,3,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,
611132b18e9901b4cf5d24a6,28063,"<h3>Discovery’s departure is ‘shot across the bow’ for Silver Spring, state and region</h3>Across the street from Discovery Communications’ towering headquarters in downtown Silver Spring, Jay Ayaba eyed the line of customers at the Starbucks where he works as a shift supervisor. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">It was almost time for an early afternoon surge, overwhelmingly made up of Discovery employees whom Ayaba has come to know by name, face and order — such as Susie and her extra-hot decaf latte.
</span>“This might be a Discovery rush right here,” Ayaba said, looking over his shoulder.
Ayaba,<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 24,</span> remembers how much Discovery’s arrival enlivened Silver Spring. He says it was as if “a whole new community had been built overnight.” <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Now he’s worried about the impact of the company’s announcement Tuesday that it will move its corporate headquarters to New York and relocate most of <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 1,300 Maryland</span> jobs.
</span>“We’re still going to be open,” Ayaba said, “but it’s going to be slower than usual around here.”
Plenty of others share his concerns. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Discovery’s exit will cost Montgomery County and Maryland tens of millions of dollars in lost payroll, tax receipts and vendor sales.</span> It will deprive Silver Spring of the high-profile anchor company — perhaps best-known for airing “Shark Week” — that sparked the suburb’s commercial revival beginning in the late 1990s. It will also force the county to find a new occupant for the landmark edifice close to the Silver Spring Metro station.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">In addition, for the greater Washington region, Discovery’s decision stirred fresh anxiety about structural weaknesses in the area’s economy that hamper its ability to compete for top-quality companies.</span> The headquarters move — largely to be closer to the entertainment industry mecca that is New York — cripples hopes that the Washington region can develop as a national hub for broadcast and digital entertainment media.
[Discovery Communications is selling Md. headquarters and moving to New York.]
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Montgomery’s failed effort to retain several hundred back-office jobs also highlighted the challenges posed by the area’s high prices.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Discovery is moving those positions to Knoxville, Tenn., where it said the cost of living is <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 40 percent</span> lower.
</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">“It’s unfortunate because this is exactly the type of company Washington is trying to attract: a business that isn’t dependent on government spending and can help diversify the economy,” said Stephen S. Fuller, a regional economist at George Mason University.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“It does damage to our brand and the brand we would like to have, that the Washington area is a good place to do business,” Fuller said.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Discovery executives and Maryland elected officials pushed back against the notion that the company’s decision resulted from an unattractive business climate.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">They said the change was inevitable because of Discovery’s acquisition, <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $14.6 billion</span> cash-and-stock deal that is still in progress, of Scripps Networks Interactive, owner of HGTV, Food Network and the Travel Channel.
</span>The new company would have major offices in three locations — New York, Silver Spring and Knoxville — and it made sense to consolidate operations and reduce that number to two.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">“Our decision has nothing to do with incentives or the business environment in Montgomery County,” chief corporate operating officer David C. Leavy said.</span> “We’ve had a wonderful run [here].”
[Turnabout as fair play? Md. Democrats roast Hogan over Discovery’s move to New York.]
Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said top Discovery executives told him there was nothing the state could have done to prevent the loss.
“They assured us it didn’t have anything to do with Maryland,” Hogan said. “They’re simply going through a merger, as most media outlets are.”
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">But there was no disguising the sobering reality that the state lost out to New York for the high-end, creative jobs — some of which will also go to Los Angeles — and to Tennessee for the low-end positions.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Some technology jobs will also cross the river to Sterling, Va., while several hundred positions will remain in Maryland.
</span>“This is a shot across the bow for this region,” said Bob Buchanan, chairman of <span id=""13"" class=""red"">the Montgomery County Economic Development Corp.</span> “We need to seriously address some of these challenges.”
Discovery’s departure is particularly bitter because it was a homegrown success story, a company founded in Landover <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1985 that</span> grew to be an international powerhouse. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Its exit follows an all-too-familiar pattern in which start-ups take root here, blossom and then are plucked away, often through takeovers, to go to more nurturing business ecosystems.
</span>“We don’t seem to be able to hold on to companies as they scale and become successful,” Fuller said. “Businesses are realizing they get a bigger bang for their buck if they go elsewhere.”
From its origins as the Discovery Channel, dedicated to documentaries and nonfiction television programming, Discovery Communications added channels such as TLC, Animal Planet, the Science Channel and OWN (the Oprah Winfrey Network).
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Discovery was lured to downtown Silver Spring in the late 1990s, when Montgomery County offered an incentives package worth more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $10 million</span> in tax credits, grants and loans to set up shop there.
</span>The company built <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $165 million</span>, 10-story tower. The move was the primary catalyst for the revival of Silver Spring, which enjoyed a surge of development including new restaurants, theaters and minority-owned small businesses.
Discovery’s arrival “put Silver Spring on the map and made it a center of documentary work around the world,” said Doug Duncan, who was Montgomery county executive at the time.
<span id=""16"" class=""red""><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Since 2000,</span> the company has <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">received $12.3 million</span> in local and state tax incentives, grants and loans, according to Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks subsidies.
</span>The company’s departure is “devastating for Silver Spring,” Duncan said. “It is going to be really hard to replace them.”
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">That view was echoed by business owners near Discovery’s headquarter.</span> Half a mile up Georgia Avenue at Crisfield Seafood, Bonnie Swanson was tending to the tail end of the lunch crowd at the restaurant her grandparents opened <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1945.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Swanson said the family business survived waves of economic instability in Silver Spring and <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2008 recession</span>.</span> But Discovery pulling out of Silver Spring was “petrifying.”
Moving forward, Swanson said, the county and state can’t neglect Silver Spring in favor of other development plans, such as those in Bethesda, saying that Silver Spring had long been “Bethesda’s redheaded stepsister.”
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">Facing the loss of lunchtime foot traffic and Discovery employees who host business dinners at Crisfield, Swanson said her restaurant would “just have to buckle our seat belts and hold on.</span> It’s all we can do.”
A few blocks away, Juancarlo Parkhurst still had a few hours before his restaurant, Lina’s Diner and Bar, opened for dinner. <span id=""20"" class=""red"">He’d heard rumors that Discovery might be pulling out of the area for more than a year, but on Tuesday, he was forced to deal with the prospect of losing much of his happy-hour crowd of Discovery employees.
</span>Parkhurst said Discovery was “really big in helping the renaissance of Silver Spring” but also helped drive rent increases that were straining tenants.
<span id=""21"" class=""red"">“Now that there’s no longer this anchor tenant and thousands of employees, it’s very scary as a business operator,” Parkhurst said.
</span>Discovery’s decision dealt a potentially fatal setback to ambitions in the Washington area to become a major player in the entertainment industry.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">Economists said consolidation among media companies has already helped fuel an exodus in the sector.</span> BET Networks, the country’s largest cable network for African American audiences, relocated its headquarters from Northeast Washington to New York last summer. Executives said the move was part of a years-long transition into the Manhattan offices of its parent company, Viacom, which bought BET <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $3 billion</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2000.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">The company had <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 40 full</span>-time employees <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 36 freelancers</span> in Washington.
</span>Silver Spring is still home to Urban One, which <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">operates 55 radio</span> stations targeting African American listeners. But Discovery was the flagship company for this region’s hopes to secure a permanent niche in the industry.
“We have advocacy media and are the information center for political reasons, but not necessarily for documentaries or film entertainment,” Buchanan said.
<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Business leaders said Discovery’s decision highlighted the importance for the Washington region to promote economic sectors where the area already enjoys a competitive advantage and thus has good prospects to succeed.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">Such sectors include cybersecurity, biotechnology, hospitality and financial services, industries with leading companies in the Washington area.</span> A Silver Spring pharmaceutical company, United Therapeutics, has been expanding.
<span id=""26"" class=""red"">The Greater Washington Partnership, an alliance of chief executives of large employers, last month urged greater efforts in the area to train digital technology workers to aid all of those sectors.
</span>“Regions need to focus on their strengths,” said Peter L. Scher, vice chairman of the partnership and chairman of the Mid-Atlantic region for JPMorgan Chase. “What’s important for the region is to keep its eye on the ball. What are the growth sectors, and how do we continue to nurture them?”
<span id=""27"" class=""red"">The need to do more to promote growth separate from the federal government has become acute in recent years because of mandated government budget cuts in the process known as sequestration.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Economic growth has been weak <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010,</span> compared with other big metro areas, as the region struggles to add new, well-paying jobs.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">The jobs it has added — many of them in the service industry — are often low-paid positions with high turnover rates.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">Among the country’<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 15 largest</span> metropolitan areas, the Washington region ranks last in job creation and income growth, according to data from the Stephen S. Fuller Institute at GMU.
</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">As Discovery showed by shipping low-end jobs to Tennessee, the Washington region struggles to compete when business costs are a factor.
</span>Montgomery and Maryland officials offered undisclosed incentives to Discovery to offset the lower costs in Knoxville, but the gap was too wide to bridge.
<span id=""32"" class=""red"">“There’s no question it’s cheaper to do business in Knoxville,” said Leavy, the Discovery executive.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">“They don’t have a state income tax.</span> Property values are in <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 40 percent</span> <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 50 percent</span> range,” compared with those in Montgomery, he said.
<span id=""34"" class=""red"">Discovery also pointed to other cost advantages in Tennessee.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">According to <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2017 business</span> tax index, it said, Tennessee ranked 13th best while Maryland was 42nd.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Tennessee’s corporate income tax rate <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 6.5 percent</span>, compared with Maryland’<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 8.25 percent</span>.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">According to the Council for Community and Economic Research, the cost of living in Knoxville <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 41 percent</span> below that of Silver Spring, Rockville and Frederick.
</span>Discovery’s move did not come as a surprise to close observers of the company. It has cut its workforce in Silver Spring by nearly half over the past decade. Chief executive David Zaslav, a native New Yorker who took over the company <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007,</span> has been living in Manhattan in recent years even though the company’s headquarters was in Maryland.
“When the new guy came in, there didn’t seem to be any connection between him and the county, between him and Silver Spring,” Duncan, the former county executive, said.
That was in contrast with Discovery’s founder, John Hendricks, who had close relations with Duncan and other local officials. A West Virginia native, Hendricks was running a Maryland consulting firm before he launched Discovery <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1985 with</span> <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $5 million</span> investment from Allen & Co., a boutique New York investment firm known for its media expertise. The timing was right. Cable pioneer John Malone was searching for content for his nascent cable system, and he invested in Discovery and agreed to carry the channel. It hit the airwaves with an after-school special on icebergs.

611132b18e9901b4cf5d24a6,58696,"<h3>Amy Klobuchar Talks Health Care, Israel and, Yes, That Comb</h3>There was no real doubt what the first question to Senator Amy Klobuchar would be.
Backstage at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., where Ms. Klobuchar was the first in a series of presidential candidates to be interviewed on Saturday, the interviewer, Kara Swisher, asked: “Do you want to start with the comb or end with the comb?”
“We’re going to start with the comb,” Ms. Swisher, the co-founder of the technology news website Recode and a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, concluded.
“The comb” was a reference to a February New York Times article about how Ms. Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, treats her staff in the Senate. <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2008,</span> The Times reported, an aide bought her a salad in an airport but fumbled the plastic utensils. On the plane, Ms. Klobuchar berated the aide, pulled a comb out of her purse and ate the salad with it.
“It was me sort of doing a mom thing,” Ms. Klobuchar responded at Saturday’s event, co-sponsored by The Texas Tribune. “I didn’t have a fork. I used a comb to eat a salad very briefly on a plane in a MacGyver move.”
The fact that Ms. Klobuchar ate salad with a comb was not the main conclusion of the Times report. She did not mention on Saturday that, after finishing the salad, she handed the comb to the aide and ordered him to clean it.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The article, based on interviews with more than two dozen former aides, also included details about how her Senate office employees who took paid parental leave were expected to stay in their job for three times as many weeks as they had taken off — and that if they didn’t, according to an employee handbook, they would be required to pay back the money earned during their leave.
</span>In response to the article, Ms. Klobuchar’s office said it had never enforced that policy and would change the handbook. She did not address that on Saturday, and Ms. Swisher did not ask.
Ms. Klobuchar, who has previously said she “can be tough on people,” acknowledged — as she has in past responses to reports on her treatment of her staff — that she was “sometimes too tough.” “I can push them too hard,” she said. “I can always do better.”
Ms. Swisher then asked if Ms. Klobuchar felt the coverage of her treatment of staff members was sexist, given that many male politicians act similarly.
“I’m not going to go there,” she said, adding, “Whatever it is, I just can’t waste my time analyzing it, because the stakes are too high, and I care too much. That’s why I announced my candidacy in the middle of a blizzard by the Mississippi River.”
In the rest of the interview, Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Swisher had wide-ranging discussions on health care, technology, foreign policy and other issues. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Ms. Klobuchar expressed support for several policies to lower drug prices, including importing products from Canada (“In Minnesota, we can see Canada from our porch,” she joked); ending the “pay for delay” practice in which big pharmaceutical companies pay manufacturers not to produce generics; and allowing the government to negotiate drug prices with Medicare, a perennial proposal from Democrats.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">She criticized the relatively short sentence given to the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in his financial fraud case this week, citing her experience prosecuting white-collar crime and declaring, “You can’t have two systems of justice, one for the rich and powerful and one for everyone else.”</span> She denounced President Trump for his attacks on the news media, saying he “tweets whatever he wants in the morning but doesn’t respect the amendment that allows him to do it.”
She also said she disagreed with Representative Ilhan Omar’s recent comments about American politicians’ support for Israel, “because I believe you can be true to your country and advocate for another country, whether it is Israel or Canada or Ethiopia” — but condemned Mr. Trump for emboldening intolerance, including anti-Semitism, and noted Ms. Omar’s own background as a refugee.
Asked about a recent proposal by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another presidential candidate, to break up big tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, Ms. Klobuchar refused to commit to it. But she endorsed antitrust action and the breakup of monopolies broadly as “one of the governing principles for ensuring that we have a capitalist system.”
Ms. Warren also appeared at South by Southwest on Saturday, speaking with Anand Giridharadas of Time magazine. Mr. Giridharadas began the interview by telling everyone in the audience who either worked for or hoped to work for one of those tech giants to stand, and then asking Ms. Warren to explain to them why she wanted to break up their companies.
Picking Amazon as her example, Ms. Warren condemned the ability of such giants to, essentially, play on a field they control. Amazon not only runs a marketplace, she said, but uses its vast trove of information about consumers’ behavior in the marketplace to create and promote its own products.
“You can be an umpire — a platform — or you can own teams. That’s fine. But you can’t be an umpire and own one of the teams that’s in the game,” she said. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“Break those things apart and we will have a much more competitive, robust market in America.</span> That’s how capitalism should work.”
“The monopolist will make fewer monopoly profits,” she added. “Boo-hoo.”
Pressed on what this outlook said about her philosophical differences with Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running on a democratic socialist platform, Ms. Warren said she wanted capitalism to work better.
“There’s an enormous amount to be gained from markets,” she said. “But markets have to have rules. They have to have a cop on the beat. Markets without rules are theft.”
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">As in her stump speeches, Ms. Warren also spoke at length about the systemic effects of racism, especially in worsening economic inequality.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">In the 1960s, she noted, when redlining and other forms of housing discrimination were legal, the homeownership gap between black and white Americans <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 27 percentage</span> points.</span> Today, it <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 30 percentage</span> points.
“Race matters,” she said. “And until we say so and attack the problem head on, we are not going to fix it.”
Former Gov. John Kasich of Ohio was also interviewed at the festival on Saturday, as was the Starbucks founder and possible independent presidential candidate Howard Schultz.
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and former Gov. Bill Weld of Massachusetts, who is challenging Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination, were also on the schedule.",,,,,,,,,,4,,,3,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,

How a Dog’s Killing Turned Brooklyn Progressives Against One Another
After a sudden confrontation that left a golden retriever dead, neighbors came together online to support the owner of the dog. But then things changed.
Supported by
Real-world ethics question: In a well-used city park, a man with a history of erratic behavior attacks a dog and its owner with a stick; five days later, the dog dies. The man is Black, the dog owner white; the adjoining neighborhood is famously progressive, often critical of the police and jail system. At the same time, crime is up in the neighborhood, with attacks by emotionally disturbed people around the city putting some residents on edge.
In a dog-loving, progressive enclave, where pushing law and order can clash with calls for social justice, what’s the right thing to do? How do you protect the public without furthering injustice against this man?
Here’s what happened in Park Slope, Brooklyn, when real-life residents faced this situation.
On Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3,</span> Jessica Chrustic,<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 40,</span> a professional beekeeper, was walking her dog in Prospect Park a little <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 6 a</span>.m. when she saw a man rifling through the garbage outside the Picnic House. She had seen the man before — tall, with dreadlocks wrapped in a turban, carrying a long staff and often muttering to himself or cursing — and she usually kept her distance. But this morning there was no room to avoid him.
According to Ms. Chrustic, he started yelling about immigrants taking over the park, then grabbed a bottle of what she later concluded was urine and sloshed it at her and her dog. She tried to run away, but Moose, her 80-pound golden retriever mix, was straining toward the man, trying to protect her.
The man started swinging the stick, she said. One blow hit her, not seriously. Another connected solidly with the dog’s snout. Mary Rowland,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 56,</span> a hospital manager who was walking her dog nearby, said she heard the crack of wood on bone and came running toward them, screaming at the man to get away.
Both women <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">called 911,</span> and four patrol cars arrived within a few minutes. But by then, the man was gone. “Moose was bleeding from his mouth and pulling to get home,” Ms. Chrustic said. “My focus was just on caring for him.”
Ms. Chrustic was physically unhurt, but she was shaken. How could this happen in a park where she had never felt unsafe, even walking her dog late at night?
Moose had a shattered tooth that needed to be pulled. Ms. Chrustic posted a description of the encounter on the neighborhood social network Nextdoor, warning others about the man and asking them to report any sightings to the police. Her post elicited more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 280 comments</span> in the coming weeks, mostly expressing sympathy. A total stranger on the forum offered to make her a bracelet with the name Moose on it.
But then the next weekend, Moose developed sepsis from a perforated intestine, caused by a blow Ms. Chrustic had not noticed. After emergency surgery, Moose died.
Weeks passed, and the man who attacked the dog was still at large. People on Nextdoor, working from Ms. Chrustic’s description, posted that they had seen him in one part of the park or another. Ms. Chrustic, who used to visit the park four times a day, now found it too traumatic to enter unless necessary.
She was especially frustrated that the man, who was well known to people in the park, had not been arrested. “You have a person who is walking around the park who is violent and needs to be removed,” she said. “He’s known by the community. It’s disheartening.”
It was a random incident that might once have been discussed by a group of dog owners. But now it had a forum for a much wider community, with arguments about policing, vigilantism, homelessness, mental health care and progressive obstinacy all feeding into a conversation that evolved beyond the crime that set it off.
“It’s complicated,” said S. Matthew Liao, a professor of bioethics, philosophy and public health at New York University. “It’s a conflict of values, between wanting security and social justice. Everybody has a responsibility in some ways.
“There are a bunch of issues here, a bunch of threats,” he added. “We can deal with them in a compassionate way, or a not compassionate way.”
The Nextdoor effect
Nextdoor, which claims an average <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 37 million</span> users per week, started <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010 with</span> the promise of connecting people with their neighbors and neighborhoods. One slogan went, “When neighbors start talking, good things happen.”
One thing they talked about, a lot, was local crime. In Nextdoor forums for communities all over the country, this included suspected crime and sightings of “suspicious” characters, leading early critics to say that what the platform really propagated was white fear. After complaints about racial profiling <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016,</span> the company instituted diversity training for its operations staff and new protocols for posts about crime and safety. But even <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020,</span></span> Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez characterized it as an outlet for privileged white people to vent criminal fantasies about their Black and brown neighbors. She tweeted, “@Nextdoor needs to publicly deal w/ their Karen problem.”
A Nextdoor spokesperson said the company enables users to report any posts that they find offensive or discriminatory, which are then reviewed by volunteer community moderators or staff members. <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2021,</span> <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 1 percent</span> of posts were reported as hurtful or harmful; about half of these were removed.
When Ms. Chrustic posted about the attack, the first responses were mostly notes of condolence and support. People with dogs posted that they had seen the man in the same area where she was attacked — why weren’t the police arresting him? Donations poured in to offset her veterinary bills.
But gradually, other voices emerged. A vocal minority asked why Park Slope residents, mostly white, were calling for the police to take down a man who appeared to be homeless and emotionally disturbed. Others called the man a “monster,” a “predator” or a “psychopath.” As on other social media platforms, the most ardent voices made the most noise.
Martin Lofsnes,<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 52,</span> a dancer and choreographer who moved out of the neighborhood <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2020,</span></span> came across the conversation while trying to sell some stuff and was appalled by the vitriol directed at an impoverished man, and by what he called “this vigilante attitude.”
He urged people on the thread to put their emotions aside and consider “400 yrs of systematic racism which has prevented black people from building generational wealth through homeownership resulting in the extreme disparity we see today.” Arresting the man, he wrote, would solve none of that.
With all the affluence in Park Slope, he posted, maybe critics should raise money to help the man, not throw him to the lethal jail system, from which he would most likely emerge more dangerous, or not emerge at all.
Others called Mr. Lofsnes naïve or accused him of mansplaining, or told him to take his comments to another thread.
“It’s easy to say that you’re for prison reform and you’re a liberal, until it happens to you,” Mr. Lofsnes said in an interview. “When it happens to you, you have to deal with it. You have to take a step back, even in that heated situation where her dog died, and say, ‘What does this do in the larger scheme of things?’”
To Ms. Chrustic and many on Nextdoor, the issue was simple: A man who killed a dog and attacked its owner was a risk to everyone. She asked people who saw the man to <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">call 911 and</span> to send her photographs so she could confirm that it was really him.
Though most people on the site were supportive, some of the commentary and messages disturbed her. She was accused of not cooperating with the police; some suggested that she did not deserve a dog because she had not protected hers. “People can be horrible,” she said. “And people also take it as an opportunity to vent. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">It becomes a politically divisive conversation I have no interest in being a part of.”
</span>She worked with a police artist to create a sketch of the man, even though part of his face had been covered during the attack. The sketch went up on Nextdoor, and police officers posted it in the park, prompting more reports of sightings.
For Nicole Haddad, who stopped going to the park with her pitbull-vizsla mix, Kingsley, after he was the victim of a similar attack three years ago, Ms. Chrustic’s posts hit home. Since then, Ms. Haddad said, Kingsley has been fearful and sometimes aggressive and has needed expensive behavioral specialists and anti-anxiety medication.
“When I read Jessica’s post, I got really, really triggered,” she said. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">“I just knew the journey that Jessica was going to be in for, because it’s caused me emotional and financial duress.</span> I reached out to her immediately.” The two women compared information and concluded that their dogs were attacked by the same man. To the people who focused more on social justice than removing a threat, Ms. Haddad said: “I tell those people to shut up. They don’t have a leg to stand on.
“I don’t care that it’s being divisive, and that people don’t want to see this guy die in Rikers Island,” Ms. Haddad added. “I’m a New York liberal. I am absolutely for people getting the help they need. But this person is attacking people and killing dogs. He’s targeting women and dogs. He’s violent. He should not be in the park. He should be locked up and paying for his actions.”
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Don’t be a cop, Kris
Kristian Nammack,<span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 59,</span> who works in sustainable financing, read the Moose posts on Nextdoor and grew frustrated that nothing seemed to be happening.</span> So he decided to do something about it. He invited people on Nextdoor and Meetup to form a neighborhood watch group to “take our neighborhood back.” As an enticement, he created a logo and <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">printed 10 T</span>-shirts. “We may also get to wear cool berets,” his solicitation offered, nodding to the Guardian Angels, an anti-crime “safety patrol” prominent in the ’70s and ’80s.
Mr. Nammack’s name for the new group: Park Slope Panthers.
He did not see the backlash coming.
“In my mind it was getting people to provide some visibility of community members in the park, especially at hours when women feel vulnerable, <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">like 6 to</span><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 9,</span>” he said. “Not vigilantes, not with guns, not with the intention to tackle an attacker, but just to be another physical presence. I think just a presence deters crime.”
Mr. Nammack, who was involved in ACT UP and Occupy Sandy, presents himself as a soft-spoken voice of reason, with a Quaker background and a longstanding commitment to progressive causes. He was surprised suddenly to be embraced by people to the right of him. He said he was invited to appear on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” and to meet with Curtis Sliwa, the Guardian Angels founder who ran a tough-on-crime campaign for mayor. Flustered, he declined both.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Then there was the group’s name, which was an immediate flash point: a white financial services guy using the Panther name to take action against a Black man.</span> At the group’s first and only meeting, the scattering of potential volunteers was met by a group of four people, all white, who showed up to disrupt the proceedings.
As described in the news site Hell Gate and the newsletter Common Sense, things went awry almost from the start. A man calling himself Snow told the group, “We are super not into you guys having your meeting, or doing anything in the park,” according to Hell Gate. “The opposite of what we need right now is more cops in this park and more people who want to be helping the cops in this park, when people are already being, like, chased down by the cops.”
To the delight of people who enjoy making fun of Park Slope liberals, one of the disrupters, a woman calling herself Sky, said, “Crime is an abstract term that means nothing in a lot of ways,” according to Common Sense.
A few days after the meeting, someone spray-painted the sidewalk outside Mr. Nammack’s apartment: “Don’t Be a Cop, Kris.” It rattled him. “Even being gay, I don’t know that I’ve ever been the target of hate,” he said. “I felt that I was the target of hate.” He decided he did not have the time or energy to continue the group.
On Nextdoor, people seemed to be dug into their positions. Many bundled the lack of an arrest with the rise of other crimes in the neighborhood. Serious crimes in the 78th Precinct, which includes Park Slope, are <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 50 percent</span> from two years ago, though well below the highs of the early 1990s.
A spokesperson for the Police Department said they were conducting canvasses of the park but would not comment on why there had been no arrest. At a virtual town meeting, Capt. Frantz Souffrant noted that numerous people in the area wear dreadlocks and carry staves. Ms. Rowland — the woman who witnessed the assault — went on at least three rides with officers to confirm a sighting. Each time the person was gone, or it was the wrong man.
Both Ms. Chrustic and Mr. Nammack separately appealed to their representative on the City Council, Shahana Hanif, for help, but they came away feeling her staff members were more concerned with the safety of the man — whom they presumed to be homeless and mentally ill — than with the threat he might pose to others.
Mr. Nammack said he was told: “‘We don’t want the police involved in this.’” He said, “They didn’t seem concerned that there was a public safety threat with this man at large, and that he needs to be dealt with. The bigger concern was keeping this man out of Rikers, and let’s not do anything.”
Under New York law, depending on the level of cruelty, killing a dog can be a misdemeanor or a felony, carrying a prison sentence of up to two years. Michael Whitesides, a spokesperson for Ms. Hanif, called the situation complicated. “We don’t believe that the N.Y.P.D. is the vehicle to bring safety to our community,” Mx. Whitesides said. “When it comes to this individual, they’re clearly a present danger to others and most likely themselves, and figuring out how we can safely de-escalate that situation without putting anyone else in danger is complicated.”
The debate, Mx. Whitesides said, was simply what happens when progressive priorities clash. “Even among the progressives, everyone wants to be safe,” they said. “These debates in the community, while they can feel very tense — this is how we find a solution. It’s going to come through neighbors talking to neighbors.”
Can you support social justice and the police?
On a recent afternoon, nearly two months after the attack, the park was a 526-acre sanctuary from social media and liberal hand-wringing, its tree-lined paths and open fields indifferent to the disputations among its users. Schoolchildren, let out into the exquisite early fall afternoon, fanned excitedly over the gently sloping lawn, as a police cruiser idled nearby, its misery lights flashing. The park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who designed Central Park, both connects and separates the disparate neighborhoods around it.
Ms. Chrustic was willing to talk on a bench outside the park, but not to enter within. Like Mr. Nammack, she felt compelled to stress her progressive bona fides, including volunteer work she’d done for homeless organizations. She wore the M-O-O-S-E bracelet given to her through Nextdoor. “And I don’t even wear bracelets usually,” she said.
She said she still had not moved Moose’s bed or food bowls in her apartment.
“I’m very empathetic toward people who are unhoused and are having hard times and who have mental illness,” she said. “I think that there should be more resources for them. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">There should be more housing situations.</span> But what I emphasize is that this is just one person who needs to be removed from the park. He’s violent. End of story.”
For two months, she has grown increasingly impatient with the police, local officials and neighbors on Nextdoor who seemed more concerned about her attacker’s welfare than her safety.
“Are they waiting for somebody to die?” she said. “Are they waiting for someone to get hurt more severely? I was lucky. My dog was not. What happens to the next person? What happens if it’s a child? How many more people need to be harmed?”
Mr. Nammack, for his part, had come to see his failed effort to start a community watch group, and the disastrous meetup, as a successful exercise in democracy. He had solicited a range of viewpoints, and he got them. “The Saturday meeting, looking back, it was great,” he said. “It brought up a lot of issues. It was quite diverse. It left more open questions than answers. They’re all good questions, but I don’t have the bandwidth to answer. So I feel like I opened a can of worms, and I’m walking away from it.”
For now, he was urging people to sign a petition on Change.org, demanding that Mayor Eric Adams “take appropriate action to rectify this matter.” More <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 600 people</span> have signed the petition.
But Mr. Nammack was not done. After a brief ban from Nextdoor, which was never explained, he returned to the fray. Once again he posted the police sketch of Ms. Chrustic’s attacker, above the headline: STILL AT LARGE. PROSPECT PARK VAGRANT. VIOLENT AND SOCIOPATHIC.
Twenty-seven people clicked that they liked the post. Then Mr. Nammack’s posts were removed again.

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 12,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2014 12</span>:59 pm ET

NORFOLK, Va.—With J.C. Penney Co. and Sears Holdings Corp. racing to close stores, America's weakest malls are being pushed to the brink.

Nearly half of <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1,050 indoor</span> and open air malls in the U.S. have both of those struggling chains as anchor tenants, according to real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">Of those malls, nearly a quarter are struggling with sales <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $300 per</span> square foot and vacancy rates <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 20%,</span> meaning they will have a hard time finding new tenants if old ones leave.

</span>For an already-weakened mall industry, the negative turn for two once-reliable anchors is promising more stress at a time when the Internet is steadily stealing traffic. And the pressure is only growing. Sears Chief Executive Eddie Lampert this week said he plans to close more stores to help return the company to profitability.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Vacancy rates rose and sales plunged at the Gallery at Military Circle, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 5 miles</span> from downtown Norfolk, Va., after the Sears store closed its doors two years ago.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Eventually the mall's owner missed multiple payments on its debt.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Remaining retail tenants worry about what will happen when the Penney store closes this month, darkening another corner of the 44-year-old property.

</span>Bruce Van, who manages Gent's, a locally owned boutique specializing in men's suits and fedoras and Sunday church clothes, said foot traffic fell by more than half after the Sears closed.

""When J.C. Penney goes out in May, it's going to be bad,"" said Mr. Van, who is also pastor at Rivers of Life Fellowship in Hampton, Va.

The first U.S. indoor mall opened in Edina, Minn., <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1956,</span> and construction peaked in the 1980s. Only six new malls have been built <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010,</span> according to CoStar Group, a provider of commercial real-estate information. Meanwhile, the number of ""dead malls,"" those with vacancy rates <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 40%,</span> has nearly tripled <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2006 to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 74 properties</span>.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The fate of the mall business matters, because even as the industry struggles, it remains an important source of economic activity.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Sales per square foot at the nation's malls grew <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 2.6% last</span> year—their slowest pace <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2009,</span> according to International Council of Shopping Centers.</span> Vacancy rates are stubbornly high, at an average of more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 8% at</span> regional malls, not far off <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2011 peak</span> in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 9.4%,</span> according to data company Reis Inc.

""Just because people are making fewer trips to the mall doesn't mean they're spending less,"" said Jesse Tron, a spokesman for the ICSC. Mr. Tron said that malls are trying to reinvent themselves by adding entertainment like indoor golf courses and higher-end restaurants, as well as services such as same-day delivery.

Still, it is tough to reverse such high vacancy rates when large anchor-tenant retailers like Sears and Penney are closing stores and others like Macy's Inc. are opening fewer locations.

Penney, which racked <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up $2.4 billion</span> in losses over the past two years, plans to <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">close 33 of</span> its stores, most of them in malls. Sears, with losses <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $2.3 billion</span> over the same period, has <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">closed 116 of</span> its full-line Sears stores <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2010.</span> Penney and Sears declined to comment.

To be sure, the exit of a troubled retailer can create an opportunity for stronger malls to find healthier tenants. But it is a different situation for struggling malls. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">And the potential damage from losing an anchor tenant is especially high in malls that have both Penney and Sears as tenants, said Gary Balter, a retail analyst with Credit Suisse.</span> ""If one of them goes, it almost forces the other one out, because the mall just won't get enough traffic,"" Mr. Balter said.

The exit of an anchor can cause other stores to leave or renegotiate their leases, contributing to a spiral of declining traffic and investment.

At the Gallery at Military Circle, the cavernous,<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 128,000</span>-square-foot space once occupied by Sears remains empty. ""For Lease"" posters dot the windows of other darkened storefronts.

The mall's situation is already tenuous. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">In November, and again in February and April, Thor Equities LLC, its owner, missed payments on <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $53 million</span> securitized loan, and Thor is in talks to restructure the debt, according to Trepp LLC, a company that collects data on real-estate debt.

</span>The Gallery is hanging on to its other anchors—Macy's at the north end and an 18-screen Cinemark Holdings Inc. movie theater on the south. A Macy's spokesman said the retailer has no plans to leave. Cinemark didn't return calls seeking comment.

At the Southlake Mall in Morrow, Ga., after the Penney there closed in <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 2011,</span> a number of national-chain tenants had their rent payments reduced, real-estate executives said. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The mall's total sales fell <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $58 million</span> in January <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $60 million</span> in the year Penney closed as vacancies rose.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">Several retailers at the mall said their sales have fallen <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 30% since</span> Penney left.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">""J.C. Penney brought people to the mall,"" said Joseph Nguyen, who operates a jewelry-repair kiosk near the food court and was one of the retailers whose sales fell off.

</span>Southlake occupied what was considered prime real estate in suburban Clayton County when the property was built just off <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Interstate 75 in</span><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1976.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Housing developments were springing up as the city expanded southward, bringing in new residents and eager shoppers.

</span>Over the past decade, however, Southlake's fortunes have turned. Newer shopping destinations in neighboring Henry County pulled customers away. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Clayton County lost jobs when a nearby Ford Motor Co. plant closed <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006.</span></span> The mall took a further hit when Clayton County dropped bus service two years ago.

Southlake lost its first anchor <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003,</span> when Macy's closed one of its two stores at the mall. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">Unable to find another retail tenant, General Growth Properties, which bought the mall <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1997,</span> turned the space into offices and a convention center.</span> General Growth filed for <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Chapter 11 bankruptcy</span> protection <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2009 and</span> emerged <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2010.</span> A year later, Penney left Southlake mall.

While the mall's occupancy rate has remained <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 90%,</span> Southlake has lost several national players, including The Limited and Gap clothing chains and the Chick-fil-A fast-food restaurant.

""Two anchors aren't enough to draw people to the mall,"" said Michelle Laidig, who has worked at Southlake <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 25 years</span>. ""The mall used to be a destination. Now the locals just come here to return items they bought at other malls.""

The future may be turning around. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Vintage Real Estate LLC, which acquires and redevelops underperforming malls, bought Southlake in April for an undisclosed price and plans to <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">invest $3 million</span> to revitalize the property.

</span>""We talked to every tenant,"" Vintage Chairman Fred Sands said. ""We found out how they are doing and what the facility needs.""

Mr. Sands said he is negotiating with new restaurants for the food court and is interviewing tenants to take over the former Penney space.

The chairman disputes the idea that the mall was hurt by Penney's closing. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Sales excluding newly opened or closed stores have held steady at <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $320 per</span> square foot <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2011,</span> according to documents Mr. Sands provided.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Lost business from Penney was offset by increased sales from the mall'<span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 16 shoe</span> retailers, including Foot Locker and Athlete's Foot, he said.

</span>RaeQuel Fagin, a 20-year-old-restaurant worker who met a friend at the food court on a recent Tuesday afternoon, said the mall was a good place to come for sneaker releases, but not for much else.

""I wouldn't say this is where I would come if I felt like shopping,"" Ms. Fagin said.

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 8,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019 2</span>:27 am ET

Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, said hackers stole more <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $40 million</span> worth of bitcoin from its platform in what it called a “large scale security breach.”

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The theft offers another example of the vulnerability facing cryptocurrencies and the venues where investors trade them.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Yet the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies barely budged after the robbery was disclosed Wednesday morning in Asia.

</span>Binance said it discovered Tuesday <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 7,000 bitcoins</span> were stolen from a single wallet, amounting to <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 2% of</span> the company’s total bitcoin holdings.

Hackers used phishing, viruses and other techniques, the company said. Binance said they had obtained information about multiple users, including two-factor authentication codes. Industry participants said they believed it was the first major breach at Binance.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Binance, which was founded in China but now operates outside the country, said it was suspending deposits and withdrawals for one week while it conducts a security review, although users will still be able to trade existing funds.</span> Stolen funds would be refunded through its emergency insurance account, the company said.

“The hackers had the patience to wait, and execute well-orchestrated actions through multiple seemingly independent accounts at the most opportune time,” Binance said. “The transaction is structured in a way that [it] passed our existing security checks. It was unfortunate that we were not able to block this withdrawal before it was executed.”

In a video posted on Twitter following the disclosed hack, Changpeng Zhao, chief executive at Binance, described the incident as “a very advanced, persistent hacking effort.” <span id=""4"" class=""red"">He said trading might need to be halted “for a couple of hours here and there” due to system upgrades.

</span>He said Binance has the funds to back the stolen amount. “It does hurt very much but we are able to cover that,” he said in the video. “We are not short on funds right now,” he added.

Hacks were a primary reason for bitcoin’s steep fall last year following its manic rally <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">While bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, is up more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 50% so</span> far this year, it remains down by <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 70% from</span> its record high in <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2017.</span>

</span>“People are quite used to exchange hacks,” said John Patrick Mullin, a cryptocurrency investor and blockchain consultant in Hong Kong. “Markets didn’t move nearly as much as they would’ve one year ago if the same thing happened.”

Bitcoin recently traded <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $5,800,</span> according to CoinDesk.

Cryptocurrency exchanges and investors are often targeted by hackers. More <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $1.7 billion</span> has been publicly reported stolen over the years, mostly from exchanges in Asia, including Japanese platforms Mt. Gox and Coincheck.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Last month, the New York attorney general’s office said an exchange called Bitfinex had covered up a loss <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $850 million</span> of corporate and customer funds by using the reserves of the digital currency it controls, tether.

</span>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies exist on independent networks and operate on the blockchain, a public record of transactions. In an effort to replicate the anonymity of physical cash, those transactions aren’t connected to an identity. The anonymity is appealing to bitcoin proponents but is also attractive to hackers and makes it tough to catch thieves.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">“Hacking risks are part of the business reality for crypto exchanges,” said Henri Arslanian, global crypto leader at PwC. “While crypto exchanges are becoming increasingly better prepared, hackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated as well.”

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 26,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 12</span>:31 pm ET

Anheuser-Busch InBev NV still has a way to go in its quest to woo increasingly fickle American drinkers.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The brewer behind Budweiser and Bud Light on Thursday said U.S. revenue <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 3.1% in</span> the second quarter on the back of lower volumes, as both brands continued to lose market share.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The weak performance was a factor in the company missing overall sales growth forecasts, prompting shares to drop more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 5%.</span>

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Sales of the two brands have fallen as once-loyal American consumers shift away from domestic lagers toward craft beers, Mexican imports, wine and spirits.

</span>In response, the company is trying to persuade consumers to buy more expensive beers, rolling out Michelob Ultra Pure Gold, made with organic grains, and Bud Light Orange, brewed with citrus peels. It also plans to launch pricier variants of Budweiser, including a beer aged on bourbon barrel staves, due to begin selling next month.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">On Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Felipe Dutra said there was “no silver bullet, no short term answer to some of the problems we face,” in the U.S., although he added the company’s efforts to innovate and go upmarket were bearing fruit.

</span>AB InBev pointed to some signs of improvement, noting quarterly share losses in the U.S. had slowed, with <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 0.35 percentage</span> point drop in the last quarter its best quarterly performance in almost four years. It said Michelob Ultra—marketed as a beer for people with an active lifestyle—continued to perform well.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Overall, AB InBev reported a jump in net profit <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1.94 billion</span> for the three months to <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 30,</span> <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $1.5 billion</span> a year earlier, as lower costs helped offset <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1.2% fall</span> in revenue <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $14.01 billion</span>.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Stripping out currency changes and acquisitions, sales <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">grew 4.7%,</span> missing analyst estimates for growth <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 5.4%.</span></span> Shares <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped 4.2% in</span> Brussels following the results.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">While some multinationals have said tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are pushing up costs, Mr. Dutra said AB InBev’s costs haven’t risen yet as the company is still protected by hedges.</span> It will begin to feel the impact from these next year.

Outside of the U.S., results were buoyed by Brazil, Mexico, China and Western Europe, helped by the soccer World Cup in Russia, and AB InBev’s efforts to sell pricier drinks.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">The World Cup didn’t help sales in the U.S., where viewership was lower than for past tournaments as a result of the American team’s failure to qualify.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">AB InBev said its sponsorship of the soccer tournament was an opportunity to boost sales of Budweiser in international markets as revenue for the beer outside of the U.S. was up by more <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10%.</span>

</span>Volume growth in Brazil was slightly hampered by a truck strike, offsetting gains from the World Cup.

The company also announced some organizational changes to spur growth.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">It will combine ZX Ventures, a unit founded <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2015 to</span> develop new products for emerging consumer needs, with its marketing arm.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The innovation unit in April bought a U.K.-based spirits, e-commerce and import business.

</span>“In order to continue to grow, we have anticipate the future,” said Chief Executive Carlos Brito on a call with investors. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Bringing the two units together “will help us achieve our objective of anticipating market and consumers trends,” he added.

</span>AB InBev is also creating a new position: a head of nonalcoholic beverages. Millennials and so-called “Generation Z” are drinking less than older generations, spurring booze makers to launch more low-alcohol and nonalcoholic products.

Nonalcoholic drinks—which mostly include energy drinks and nonalcoholic beers—make up more <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10% of</span> AB InBev’s volumes.

The company is also restructuring its management, collapsing nine geographical divisions into six in a move it said would help it become more agile following its integration of SABMiller, the London-based brewing giant it acquired <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span>

We can definitely see some advantages. A quick programming note: The <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Health 202 is</span> publishing three days this week. But we’ll be back to our regular schedule next week — see you Monday!

Today’s edition: Nearly half of adults give the U.S. health system a poor or failing grade, per a new report. Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) is rolling out a new campaign critical of drug middlemen. But first ...

Abortion access is at stake in GOP-run states that could elect Democratic governors

The future of abortion access in a handful of battleground states may rest with who wins the governor’s mansion in November.

Democrats are leaning into that message on the campaign trail, seeking to make the November elections a referendum on what they describe as the Republican Party’s extreme position on abortion. This dynamic is playing out in gubernatorial contests in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona — all of which have GOP-controlled state legislatures.

“The landscape changes from state to state, but our message has stayed focused on making sure voters know what a Republican can do to either chip away at current rights or advance existing restrictions,” said Christina Amestoy, a spokesperson for the Democratic Governors Association.

The notion of abortion access changing by the party in power is driving increased attention to statewide races up and down the ballot, even as control of Congress hangs in the balance of this year’s midterm elections. Meanwhile, GOP officials believe the party has a chance to make inroads with late-deciding voters, particularly as the months pass since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, our colleague Annie Linskey reported yesterday.

What the Michigan midterms mean for the future of abortion

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and activists explain <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Proposal 3,</span> a midterm ballot measure which would enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution. (Video: Hannah Jewell, Lindsey Sitz, Ross Godwin/The Washington Post, Photo: Emily Elconin/The Washington Post)

The landscape: The midterms are less than five weeks away. Voters <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 36 states</span> will choose their governor — <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 20 Republicans</span> <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 16 Democrats</span> holding offices that will be up for election this year.

Groups on both sides of the abortion debate — such as NARAL Pro-Choice America and SBA Pro-Life America — are pouring their resources into governor’s races.

Here are the key contests we’re watching:

Wisconsin: Gov. Tony Evers (D) is in a competitive race against Republican nominee Tim Michels. The state has a pre-Roe ban on the books, which Evers filed a lawsuit to repeal and the state’s Democratic attorney general has said he won’t enforce. However, clinics halted all abortion procedures shortly after the Supreme Court’s ruling.

Michigan: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) is running against Republican challenger Tudor Dixon. Abortion in the state is legal after a state judge invalidated a pre-Roe ban on the procedure. Whitmer has asked the state Supreme Court to strike down the ban as well.

But even if Dixon wins, a Republican-controlled legislature could have a hard time enacting bans on the procedure. That’s because voters will decide whether to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution this November.

Arizona: Katie Hobbs (D) and Kari Lake (R) are fighting to fill this open seat. Earlier this year, Gov. Doug Ducey (R) — who is term-limited — signed legislation banning abortion <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 15 weeks</span>. However, an Arizona judge revived a near-total ban on abortion dating back to the mid-19th century a day before the 15-week limit was set to go into effect.

Pennsylvania: This is another contest with no incumbent. State Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D) and state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R) are fighting to succeed the state’s Democratic governor. Abortions are still legal in the state, but that could change if Mastriano wins and the GOP-controlled legislature sends restrictions on the procedure to his desk.

Georgia: This gubernatorial battle is a redo <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2018.</span> Gov. Brian Kemp (R) is again facing Democrat Stacey Abrams, who has made abortion rights a centerpiece of her campaign. The state has a ban on abortion after fetal cardiac activity, which is at roughly six weeks.

Democrats are working to keep the midterms focused on abortion, believing the issue is a powerful motivator to drive voters to the ballot box. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">However, those efforts are colliding with increased Republican efforts to focus on crime and the economy.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Nationally, recent Google News searches for inflation have been about even with inquiries on abortion.</span> This is the case for battleground states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Georgia, Annie reports.

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">* “The moderate and independent voters needed to build winning coalitions in competitive governors races are worried about the economy, crime, and education,” Joanna Rodriguez, a Republican Governors Association spokesperson, said in a statement to The <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Health 202.</span></span></span> The focus on abortion shows to those voters that Democrats “not only don't care about their greatest concerns, but also that they have no plans to address them,” Rodriguez said.,

Here's one interesting figure: Democrats in local, statewide and congressional races across the country have vastly outspent Republicans on advertising on abortion. Since Jan.<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> Democrats have spent <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $236 million</span>. Meanwhile, Republicans have spent <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $62 million</span>, according to AdImpact, which tracks commercials. (h/t Azi Paybarah, who crunched the numbers for us.)

Meanwhile,<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 66 clinics</span> <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">across 15 states</span> have stopped offering abortions, according to a report out today from the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research center that supports abortion rights. <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Roughly 40 are</span> offering services other than abortion, <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">while 26 have</span> shut down. Before the Supreme Court's ruling, those states had a total <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 79 clinics</span> providing abortions. <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">The 13 that</span> are still performing the procedure are located in Georgia, where there's a ban after fetal cardiac activity is detected.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Biden administration’s Project Covid Shield hits a snag

The Biden administration’s plan to create a new accelerator for coronavirus vaccines and treatments has hit a standstill, complicated by fading interest among the public and lawmakers alike to continue treating the pandemic as a priority, Politico reports.

</span>Now, senior health officials are raising alarm bells about the nation’s defenses against the rapidly evolving virus without a long-term operation to ensure that its arsenal of tools stay up-to-date with the latest variants.

Key context: The initiative, dubbed Project Covid Shield, was intended to serve as a follow up to Operation Warp Speed, a Trump-era program that doled out federal dollars to private drugmakers to speed up the production of coronavirus vaccines. Officials had hoped to replicate the approach with new candidates to continue developing increasingly advanced shots and therapeutics to fight the virus — all while maintaining the nation’s edge in the global war against covid-19, Politico’s Adam Cancryn and Erin Banco write.

The White House has yet to secure <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $8 billion</span> from Congress it says it needs to get Project Covid Shield off the ground due to a stalemate with Republicans over new coronavirus aid. Meanwhile, even GOP lawmakers open to the concept have categorized the administration’s effort to date as disorganized and vague.

Americans give failing marks to U.S. health-care system

New this a.m.: Nearly half of adults give the country’s health care system a poor or failing grade, according to a new West Health-Gallup poll, which found that Americans across party lines see lobbying and partisan politics as major barriers to finding solutions to address the rising costs of medicine.

By the numbers:

* Sixty-six percent of Americans report their household pays too much relative to the quality of care that it receives, up six points compared with April of last year, according to the poll, which surveyed more <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 5,5000 adults</span>., * <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Six <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 10 Americans</span> report that cost is an important factor when considering a recommended medical procedure or medication., *</span> Half the country — an <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 129 million</span> adults — have low levels of confidence that they can afford health care as they age., * Two in three Americans <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 65 believe</span> Medicare will not exist when they reach the age of eligibility.,

First in The Health 202: Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), a pharmacist, is rolling out a campaign attacking pharmacy benefit managers often known as drug middlemen. In a new 20-page pamphlet, Carter alleges that PBMs use “various tactics to limit patient medication and increase drug costs” and includes interviews with patients.

It’s another salvo in the drug-pricing wars, where PBMs and other industry players spar over who’s driving up the costs. Carter points to various pieces of legislation he wants to see passed, such as a bill he introduced that would ban the use of spread pricing in Medicaid managed care. Spread pricing is when PBMs charge payers more than they pay to the pharmacy and keep the difference.

PBMs hit back. “Americans consistently reject the use of blame game tactics, especially when real patients’ health and lives are at stake,” JC Scott, the president of Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, said in a statement to The <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Health 202.</span></span> “This is especially true when it comes to blaming PBMs, the one entity reducing costs in the health care system,” Scott said.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Over the past two years, as Florida’s Walt Disney World Resort and Southern California’s Disneyland Resort have emerged from the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic, the company has made a host of changes that have sent the cost of a visit to a Disney resort skyward.

The outcome is a bonanza for Disney: <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Even as the company limits the number of visitors and keeps attendance at its U.S. theme parks below prepandemic levels, they are generating record sales and profits.

</span>The results reflect a major strategic shift on Disney’s part, where the company is focused less on maximizing the quantity of visitors and more on increasing how much money each visitor spends, an approach the company refers to as yield management. Improving the visitor experience, the thinking goes, will prompt guests to spend more hours—and therefore more money—at the parks because they are having such a good time.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The biggest change in the past two years—and the most lucrative for Disney—is the introduction of a smartphone-app feature called Genie+ that <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">costs $15 per</span> person a day, on top of the price of admission, and allows parkgoers to skip the unreserved lines for some attractions, which the company refers to as “standby.”</span> But Genie+ doesn’t cover everything. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">To skip the standby lines at the most sought-after attractions, including some Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy-themed rides, reservations now cost an <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">additional $10 to</span><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $17.</span></span> Standby waits for popular attractions can last hours.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">At the same time, many benefits that used to be free—from parking for certain annual passholders to airport shuttles to MagicBand wristbands that serve as combination hotel-room keys and park passes—have been eliminated or now come with a price.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Disney has raised prices on hotel rooms, food and merchandise over the past year as inflation has climbed to record levels in the U.S.

Disney’s theme-park pricing is determined by “pure supply and demand,” said a company spokeswoman.</span> “No different than airplanes, hotels or cruise ships.”

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">In the quarter that ended Jan.<span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span> Disney’s domestic parks set records in both quarterly revenue and operating income, then broke both of them six months later.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">For the quarter that ended <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2,</span> the business unit that includes the theme parks also posted record revenue <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $5.42 billion</span> and record operating income <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $1.65 billion</span>.

Josh D’Amaro, the chairman of Disney’s parks, experiences and products division, said that the changes have given visitors more choice about how to spend their time and money at the parks, while at the same time making the parks “extremely commercially successful.”

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">In <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fiscal 2021,</span> the first year that both of Disney’s two main U.S. resorts had reopened following the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, attendance at Disney’s U.S. parks fell <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 17% compared</span> with the previous year, the company reported, but per-capita spending by guests grew <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 17%,</span> or nearly three times the average annual growth rate during the previous decade.</span> Disney doesn’t disclose attendance for its theme parks.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">At the same time, the changes driving the increases in revenue and profit have drawn the ire of what Disney calls “legacy fans,” or longtime parks loyalists, including annual passholders who feel they are being pushed to the side in favor of big-spending families taking once-a-year, or even a once-in-a-lifetime, vacations.

</span>“Disney has this love-hate relationship with annual passholders,” said Len Testa, a computer scientist who runs Touring Plans, a travel company that offers apps to help visitors find deals and navigate their trips to Walt Disney World and publishes a popular guide to Disney theme parks.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">On one hand, they provide a reliable source of revenue—the investment bank UBS estimated early last year that annual passholders at Disneyland account for about one half of annual visits—but on the other, annual passholders tend to spend less than other visitors per visit, Mr. Testa said.

</span>A typical annual pass holder might ride only one ride during a visit, eat an ice cream cone and walk around for a few hours, taking up capacity that might otherwise be used by out-of-state visitors, Mr. Testa said.

“Those people would have stayed all day,” he said. “They would have eaten multiple times in the restaurants, they may have stayed in the hotel. They would definitely be buying more merchandise.”

Since its introduction in the fall <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2021,</span> Genie+ has become an increasingly popular tool. About half of visitors to the parks pay for and use Genie+, Disney said in a recent conference call with Wall Street analysts. And of those who pay for Genie+,<span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 70% say</span> in post-visit surveys that they plan to do so again, Disney says.

Disney has stopped selling nearly all new annual passes to Disneyland and Walt Disney World and has done away with a host of free perks that annual passholders used to enjoy. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Existing annual passholders can renew their passes, although earlier this month, the company raised the renewal price for its highest-tier annual passes to Disneyland <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 14%,</span> <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $1,599 from</span><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $1,399,</span> while at the same time introducing more blackout days when passholders can’t visit, angering some of the park’s most ardent fans.

</span>The parks have grown considerably since Walt Disney World opened <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1971.</span> Over the past decade, Disney has added rides based on popular franchises such as Star Wars, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Toy Story films and <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2009 film</span> “Avatar.” A roller coaster at Magic Kingdom based on the Tron films is under construction.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The parks business has buoyed Disney’s stock price and boosted financial results at a time when the company is losing billions on other businesses, like the popular but cost-heavy Disney+ streaming service.

</span>Mr. D’Amaro, the parks chief, is a 24-year veteran of the company who ran both Disneyland and Walt Disney World individually in previous roles.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">He keeps a high profile with fans and employees, making frequent appearances at the parks outside of major events and posting about his visits on social media.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">By contrast, his predecessor, Bob Chapek, who is now Disney’s chief executive, walked the park grounds less frequently and wasn’t as outgoing with visitors, according to Disney employees who worked under him.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">On a recent, hourlong walk through Disneyland, Mr. D’Amaro was stopped more <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20 times</span> by visitors and cast members—as Disney employees are known in company lingo—who asked to take selfies with him and thanked him for his work.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Mr. D’Amaro <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">has 144,000 followers</span> on Instagram, where he posts pictures of himself inside the parks alongside costumed employees, riding roller coasters, brandishing lightsabers and eating soft-serve.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Mr. D’Amaro said he’s aware of the tension caused by rising prices and other changes, especially for annual passholders, but describes it as the inevitable result of progress, and insists that every change Disney has implemented at the parks is in service of improving visitors’ trips.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">Other top Disney executives say the company is merely reacting to consumer behavior.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">“Demand has not abated” at the parks, Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy told analysts in a conference call in August, explaining why the company wasn’t considering opening up the parks to more days for annual passholders.</span> The new reservation system has allowed the company to limit attendance without having to turn visitors away when the parks become overcrowded, as it occasionally did in previous years.

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">The company also points out that it offers frequent promotions, including discounted room rates at its hotels, packages that become more economical the more days a visitor spends at the park, and discounts for residents of Southern California and Florida.

</span>Other theme-park operators are also reaping the benefits of increased guest spending. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Six Flags Entertainment Corp. and Cedar Fair LP, which operates Cedar Point in Ohio and Knott’s Berry Farm in California, have both raised prices, while SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. implemented <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 5% surcharge</span> on food and beverages.

</span>Sara Suvada, a Starbucks shift supervisor and barista from Auburn Hills, Mich., took her first trip to Walt Disney World in January, at the age <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 42,</span> along with her husband and 6-year-old daughter. She said the trip was the fulfillment of a fantasy from her childhood, when money was tight in her family.

The family spent <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $5,000</span>—most of it paid for by Ms. Suvada’s in-laws—on admission, meals and lodging at Disney’s Saratoga Springs Resort. Ms. Suvada spent <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around $400 on</span> souvenirs and concessions, while her husband told her he nearly maxed out his credit card on trinkets and snacks.

<span id=""25"" class=""red"">The memories made up for the price tag, though, she said.</span> She cried when she saw Cinderella Castle for the first time. Her daughter loved riding the Space Mountain roller coaster and meeting her favorite princess, Tiana, from 2009’s “The Princess and the Frog.” And the family savored tasting their first Dole Whip frozen treat. Ms. Suvada is already thinking about returning with her mother.

“The memories are worth more than gold,” she said. “Even if I did suffer from overdraft fees once I got home, when the reality set in.”

Some longtime fans who come to the park regularly, and aren’t splurging on once-in-a-lifetime memories, complain about the new fees.

“I just really resent the nickel-and-diming,” said David Arone, a 50-year-old gym teacher and volleyball coach from Redondo Beach, Calif. Mr. Arone has been a Disneyland annual pass holder for five years, and says he visits the park more <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 100 times</span> a year, primarily because it reminds him of his best childhood friend, a Disney superfan who died of a heart attack <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013.</span></span>

“I know it sounds hokey, but every time I go, I feel like he’s there with me,” Mr. Arone said of his friend. Most visits, he doesn’t ride any attractions at all. Instead, he just walks around for a few hours, eats ice cream, watches fireworks and reminisces about visiting the park with his late friend.

But he chafes at recent changes. Previously, he could stop by Disneyland for a few hours after work any day he wanted. Now he can’t go on the growing number of blackout days for annual passholders.

<span id=""26"" class=""red"">On a recent visit, Mr. Arone sported a homemade T-shirt with the words “Chapek Killed The Magic” on it — a reference to Mr. Chapek, the CEO, who he blames for rising prices and other changes.

</span>The company said annual passholders like Mr. Arone “are amongst our most special guests.”

<span id=""27"" class=""red"">This month, the company reported that ticket-price increases were offset by an “unfavorable attendance mix” at Disneyland, which many fans interpreted as a reference to annual passholders who typically spend less per visit than individual ticket-buyers.</span> Fans recently started posting pictures of themselves at the parks on social media, wearing T-shirts reading “Unfavorable” in protest.

<span id=""28"" class=""red"">Disney said that “unfavorable mix” is financial parlance meant for investors, and “not a consumer term.”

</span><span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2021,</span> a Disneyland annual pass holder sued Disney, alleging that the company engaged in deceptive practices by artificially limiting how many of them could visit the park on certain days. In May, a U.S. District Court judge in California ruled that the suit could go forward. The plaintiff has said she is seeking class-action certification.

<span id=""29"" class=""red"">Even some customers who come on special annual visits say they are getting fed up with rising prices.

</span>Renea Warren has made the pilgrimage to Walt Disney World nearly every year <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2001.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">But after tallying up the costs of this year’s vacation, the retail executive and mother of one said she has had enough.

</span>On a nine-day family trip to Florida in late July with her mother and daughter, Ms. Warren tried to save money by spending just two days at Disney theme parks, instead of the usual four. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Despite the family’s efforts, visits to Magic Kingdom and Epcot blew up their budget.</span> Park passes set them back more than $800; food was about $200; and they <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">dropped $300 on</span> souvenirs.

Since Ms. Warren, who lives in Benton Harbor, Mich., owns a timeshare <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 20 minutes</span>’ drive from Walt Disney World, her family will likely return to central Florida next year, but they’ll consider rival attractions at Universal Studios Florida and SeaWorld, she said. Returning to Disney every year is no longer an option.

“Because of the astronomical expenses, I definitely think the magic is being taken away,” she said.

The Genie+ app feature replaced a system known as FastPass that used to come free with any ticket sold at Disneyland or Walt Disney World. The new service—along with a free version, known simply as Genie—does more than make Disney money: It also helps the parks’ operators direct traffic and spread people around the parks more evenly, to reduce waiting times overall, and upsell visitors by offering them promotions on food, merchandise and ride-reservation fees.

Each park has an operation center with a “heat map” that tracks where Genie+ users are in the parks using GPS technology. Park operators can direct traffic using the app by notifying visitors where the shortest lines are and offering food and merchandise promotions to cajole them to other areas.

“If I’m seeing too much activity on the west side, I’m able to spread where I direct people to the east side,” Mr. D’Amaro said. “Our attractions will be load-balanced better, and lines will be shorter, and what that means is the experience will be better.”

<span id=""32"" class=""red"">In an analysis for The Wall Street Journal, Touring Plans analyzed room prices, including taxes, at three popular Walt Disney World hotels over the past decade, and found increases that far outpaced inflation, which in July hit a record high <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 9.1%.</span>

</span>At Pop Century, a “value” hotel at the Orlando resort, the cheapest room rate rose <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $168 this</span> year from $95 <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in<span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013.</span></span> At the deluxe Animal Kingdom Lodge, a standard room now costs as much <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $790 a</span> night, versus up <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $486 a</span> decade ago.

<span id=""33"" class=""red"">Prices for tickets and certain food items have also climbed faster than inflation over the past decade, the Touring Plans analysis found.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">Disney fan blogs have noted that classic purchases at Disney parks, including the pineapple Dole Whip frozen treat ($5.99 last year,<span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $6.99 this</span> year at some locations) and studded Mickey Mouse-ears headbands ($29.99 last summer, <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">now $39.99</span>) are quickly getting costlier, outpacing inflation.

</span>In other cases, Disney has curtailed benefits. Guests staying at Disney-owned and certain other hotels at Walt Disney World before Covid could avail themselves of Extra Magic Hours, during which hotel guests could enter certain theme parks early or stay at them later into the night.

Today, Disney offers early entry at all four of its Walt Disney World parks each day to hotel guests, but only <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 30 minutes</span>; before the pandemic, it offered an hour of early admission, but only every other day. Evening extended hours are now only available to visitors staying at the most-expensive “deluxe” tier of hotels.

Disney says some guests prefer the new arrangement.

Mariana Epperson, a 29-year-old mom from Kentucky who works as an account manager for a credit-ratings firm, spent part of her honeymoon at Disneyland, and Walt Disney World is the site of some of her final happy memories with her father, who died a few weeks after she took a trip there with her family in May.

“A lot of people will say, ‘Oh, I can go to Europe for cheaper,’ ” she said. “But Disney now holds the last really good memories of my dad, so for me it’s so important. I can always make more money.”

Even so, this summer, her husband told her he needed a break from the theme parks. They’ve visited Disney resorts six times <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2017,</span> and the parks are getting way too expensive, she said. For their family vacation next year, they are thinking about a Disney cruise. Packages for three-night cruises from San Diego or Miami start at just <span id=""66"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $1,000.</span> An ocean-view cabin costs more. So do between-meal snacks and excursions ashore.

Which options are worth paying for?

Updated Feb.<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 22,</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 12</span>:01 am ET

Amir and Mojgan Moghadam <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">spent $1.4 million</span> on their new home in Irvine, Calif. But to make it absolutely perfect, they spent a <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">further $550,000 on</span> builder upgrades—<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including $28,200 for</span> a conservatory,<span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $2,600 for</span> a Sub-Zero ice maker <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and $495 for</span> five exterior wall-light outlets.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Buying a newly built home is a lot like buying a new car at the dealership—optional features cost extra.</span> Buyers will pay more for premium granite, a fancier fridge or an epoxy-coated garage floor. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">And upgrades can be a lucrative part of a builder's business, with profit margins as high <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 60%,</span> depending on the option, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting.

</span>Indeed, buyers like the Moghadams are helping builders return to profitability after a long downturn. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">During the housing boom, homes were loaded with expensive features, and buyers snapped them up, regardless of price.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">These days, however, upscale buyers are choosier, selecting pricey options that are within their budgets and still practical for the resale market.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">An <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 10% to</span><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30% of</span> a home's base price is spent on upgrades.</span> And companies say these optional features have been spurring growth in high-end home construction.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Record-low interest rates are driving much of this spending, with a 30-year, fixed-rate average <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3.68% for</span> conforming loans, which are <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $417,000 in</span> most markets, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">or 4.13% for</span> larger loans, according to HSH.com, a mortgage-research website.</span> Monica Kaiser, for instance, added <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $70,000 worth</span> of upgrades to <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $1 million</span>-plus San Diego home she and her husband purchased in December. The Kaisers decided to spend the money now—instead of later—for the upgrades they wanted. The Kaisers opted for <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $10,000 staircase</span> with wrought-iron balusters and <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $4,500 for</span> tile and stonework in the home's 41⁄2 bathrooms, along with other features from builder Standard Pacific.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">""With interest rates so low, you're not going to be able to get what you want any cheaper at any time,"" says Ms. Kaiser, a mother of three who works for local media outlet.</span> ""To put a lot of these upgrades in down the line would have just been silly, because we'd be paying more to take out a loan or dipping into other assets.""

Some builders present buyers with thousands of choices that let them build a near-custom home that won't resemble anything else in their community. Customizing a home can make a customer less likely to cancel the deal. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">""They're emotionally attached to what they have designed,"" says Joan Marcus-Colvin, senior vice president of sales, marketing and design for the New Home Co.</span> ""They have actually pictured themselves living in that surrounding.""

To this end, builders construct lavish model homes to showcase the full range of options. Toll Brothers, a luxury builder based in Horsham, Pa., is known for models that ""pretty much upgrade everything,"" says Denise DiBlasio, who manages Toll's design studio in Bucks County, Pa. Toll will put a fireplace in the master bath or a wine grotto in the basement.

In North Palm Beach, Fla., Toll poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into upgrades for the model home at its upscale Frenchman's Harbor community, where single-family homes start <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at $1.7 million</span>. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The company says it is not unusual for a buyer to replicate the model or to copy the kitchen, regardless of cost.

</span>Toll, like many other builders, has bricks-and-mortar design centers stocked with samples of everything from carpet colors to granite slabs that customers can touch and coordinate with other items. Interior-design specialists are on hand to guide buyers on what's hot and help them avoid design disasters.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">The New Home Co., a three-year-old upscale builder in California with starting prices as high <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $2 million</span>, took <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in $9 million</span> from its design studios <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> up <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from $7.6 million</span> the prior year.

</span>Publicly traded builders, who sell more homes but generally don't disclose profits from upgrades, can rake in much more. Jeffrey Burnett estimates he and his wife spent three full days at Toll's Boca Raton, Fla., design center, one <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 15 nationwide</span>, selecting extras for <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his $2.5 million</span> home under construction in Frenchman's Harbor. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">In the end, Mr. Burnett, chief executive officer of Labor Finders International, a nationwide blue-collar staffing company based in Palm Beach Gardens, <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">added $800,000 worth</span> of upgrades, including <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $100,000 tennis</span> court and a steam room.

</span>In the past decade, builders have increasingly been allowing buyers to pick favorite items through a website or app. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Buyers can almost think of it like a game: They choose options to build their dream homes, then add or delete items as the budget permits.

</span>""It was like I was going to the store,"" says Ms. Moghadam, the Irvine, Calif., buyer of the New Home Co. house. ""I would sit on my iPad and I would just pick out all the options I liked: cabinets, sinks, hardware, faucets. You could just do it at home and have fun with it.""

The most money is usually spent on kitchens, bathrooms and flooring, according to BDX, the marketing-services and technology company behind the Envision online design center that helps customers select options. Buyers upgrade <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">flooring 73% of</span> the time, <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cabinets 70% and</span> <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">appliances 63%,</span> the company says.

In the kitchen, large, granite-topped islands that seat four to eight people are popular, as are supersize showers with sitting space, says Jeffrey Lake, Standard Pacific's national head of architecture.

Northeasterners like crown molding and wainscoting, while Florida buyers often spring for a screened-in lanai and a bathroom specifically for the pool area. On the West Coast, consumers are more likely to add large glass doors that can be opened to seamlessly combine the family living space with the outdoors, he said.

Builders warn buyers to keep an eye on spending to avoid appraisal woes. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">An extensively upgraded home could appear overvalued when compared with recent nearby sales.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">If that happens, the builder may have to cut the price or ask the buyer for extra money at the closing.</span> For that reason—and to help pay for the purchase and installation of the upgrade—some builders require upgrade deposits in advance. The Moghadams, whose purchase contract for extras <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">covered 32 pages</span>, paid <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 50% of</span> their upgrades upfront, though that was spread across multiple payments.

<span id=""14"" class=""red"">M.D.C. Holdings, a builder that operates under the Richmond American Homes name, may ask for an additional deposit if a buyer's interior-design upgrades <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">exceed 13% of</span> the base price.</span> Typically, the additional deposit <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 50% of</span> the amount spent <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 13%.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Above 18%,</span> the buyer may have to place a deposit equal <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 100% of</span> additional upgrades. The company may also ask buyers to pay for unusual choices upfront. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">""If you order the pink carpet, we're probably going to ask you to put the full deposit on that one,"" says Bob Martin, the Denver-based builder's vice president of finance and business development who is currently picking out upgrades for his new home.</span> ""Nothing against pink,"" he adds.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">And, given consumer demand, more builders are making some upscale features—things like granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances—standard, even in lower-priced homes.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Some builders, like Miami-based Lennar, purchase popular options in bulk at a discount and include them in the home's base price.</span> This approach appeals to buyers who don't want to make many decisions or feel nickel-and-dimed when opting for an upgrade like an extra electrical outlet.

One upgrade tends to hold its value: land. Former NFL player Michael Hamilton decided to build a new Standard Pacific home in San Diego after seeing a roughly half-acre lot with views of coastal sage shrub and other native plants <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">near 1,600 acres</span> of preserved open space.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">Premium lots in the upscale Bellasario at Stonebridge Estates community cost up <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $215,000 above</span> the neighborhood'<span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $900,000 base</span> price.</span> The upgraded lot gave Mr. Hamilton room for another upgrade, <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $100,000 backyard</span> cottage for guests. ""I wanted that lot and I wanted the casita,"" he said, adding that ""I wish I would have gotten a couple more upgrades.""

611132b18e9901b4cf5d24a6,21067,"<h3>Looking to themselves, Palestinians expect little from Israeli changes.</h3>Wide-Ranging Israel Coalition Reaches Deal to Form Government
Negotiating as the clock ran down, Israeli parties ranging from the left to the far right, including an Arab bloc, agreed on a coalition government.
This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the Israeli election and its aftermath here.
JERUSALEM — Israeli opposition parties on Wednesday reached a coalition agreement to form a government and oust Benjamin Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history and a dominant figure who has pushed his nation’s politics to the right.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The announcement by the parties could lead to the easing of a political impasse that has produced four elections in two years and left Israel without a stable government or a state budget.</span> If Parliament ratifies the fragile agreement in a confidence vote in the coming days, it will also bring down the curtain, if only for an intermission, on the premiership of a leader who has defined contemporary Israel more than any other.
The new coalition is an unusual and awkward alliance between eight political parties from a diverse array of ideologies, from the left to the far right. It includes the membership of a small Arab party called Raam, which would become the first Arab group to join a right-leaning coalition in Israeli history.
While some analysts have hailed the coalition as reflecting the breadth and complexity of contemporary society, others say its members are too incompatible for their compact to last, and consider it the embodiment of Israel’s political dysfunction.
The alliance would be led <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2023 by</span> Naftali Bennett, a religiously observant former settler leader who opposes a Palestinian state and wants Israel to annex the majority of the occupied West Bank. He is a former ally of Mr. Netanyahu often described as more right-wing than the prime minister.
If the government lasts a whole term, it would then be led <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2023 and</span><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2025 by</span> Yair Lapid, a centrist former television host considered a standard-bearer for secular Israelis.
The son of American immigrants, Mr. Bennett,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 49,</span></span> is a former software entrepreneur, army commando, chief of staff to Mr. Netanyahu and defense minister. His home is in central Israel, but he was once chief executive of an umbrella group, the Yesha Council, that represents Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. Until the most recent election cycle, Mr. Bennett was part of a political alliance with Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right leader.
Though Mr. Bennett’s party, Yamina, won just seven of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 120 seats</span></span> in Parliament, the anti-Netanyahu forces could not form a government without his support, allowing him to set the terms of his involvement in the coalition.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Mr. Lapid,<span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 57,</span> is a former news anchor and journalist who became a politician nine years ago and later served as finance minister in a Netanyahu-led coalition.</span> His party placed second in the general election in March, <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">winning 17 seats</span>. But Mr. Lapid considered the ouster of Mr. Netanyahu more important than demanding to go first as prime minister.
Yair Lapid, the leader of the Israeli opposition, had until midnight on Wednesday to cobble together an unlikely coalition to topple Benjamin Netanyahu. He needed almost every minute — leaving it until 11:22 p.m. to inform Reuven Rivlin, Israel’s largely ceremonial president, that he had assembled an eight-party alliance.
“The government will do everything it can to unite every part of Israeli society,” Mr. Lapid said in a statement released shortly after his call with Mr. Rivlin.
Mr. Lapid’s celebrations will be put on hold for several days, however. The speaker of the Israeli Parliament, Yariv Levin, is a member of Mr. Netanyahu’s party, Likud, and can use parliamentary procedure to delay the confidence vote until Monday, <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 14,</span> constitutional experts said.
In the meantime, Mr. Netanyahu’s party has promised to pile pressure on wavering members of Mr. Lapid’s fragile coalition, formed of hard-right parties, leftists, centrists and Arab Islamists, in a bid to persuade them to abandon the coalition. Many of them already feel uncomfortable about working with each other, and have made difficult compromises to join forces in order to push Mr. Netanyahu from office.
Mr. Lapid himself agreed to give Naftali Bennett, a hard-right former settler leader who opposes Palestinian statehood, the chance to lead the government <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">until 2023,</span> at which point Mr. Lapid will take over.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">In a sign of the friction to come, Raam, the Arab Islamist party, announced that it had joined the coalition after receiving assurances about improvements to the Arab minority’s land and housing rights that many hard-right Israelis deem unacceptable, including the regularization of three illegally constructed Arab towns in the Negev desert.
</span>An hour before the deal was announced, one hard-right lawmaker, Nir Orbach, whose party colleagues say he has been particularly unsure about joining the coalition, tweeted: “We are not abandoning the Negev. Period.”
The fact that these tensions were on full display even before the coalition was officially formed has left many Israelis wondering whether it will last more than a few months, let alone its full term.
Should the coalition collapse, analysts believe Mr. Lapid may emerge with more credit than Mr. Bennett. While Mr. Bennett gets first crack at the premiership, his decision to work with centrists and leftists has angered his already small following.
“Lapid has made a very strong set of decisions, conveyed an amazing level of maturity and really made a big statement about a different kind of leadership,” said Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli political analyst and pollster at the Century Foundation, a New York-based research group. “That will not be lost on the Israeli public.”

Now that opposition parties have reached agreement on a coalition government, it has up to seven days to present the government to Parliament for a vote of confidence.
Some disagreements within the fractious coalition were still being ironed out until shortly before the deadline on Wednesday, at midnight in Israel.
And with the fate of the new coalition dependent on a narrow margin and hanging on every single vote, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies were on the hunt for potential defectors leading up to the announcement, and signaled that they would continue until the vote of confidence.
The coalition, ranging from right to left, is united primarily by its opposition to Mr. Netanyahu, the prime minister <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2009.</span>
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Israel has held four parliamentary elections in two years, all of them inconclusive, leaving it without a stable government or state budget.</span> If the opposition fails to form a government, it could lead to yet another election.
Naftali Bennett, who is poised to become Israel’s next prime minister, is a former high-tech entrepreneur best known for insisting that there must never be a full-fledged Palestinian state and that Israel should annex much of the occupied West Bank.
The independently wealthy son of immigrants from the United States, Mr. Bennett,<span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 49,</span></span> first entered the Israeli Parliament eight years ago and is relatively unknown and inexperienced on the international stage. That has left much of the world — and many Israelis — wondering what kind of leader he might be.
A former chief of staff to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, Mr. Bennett is often described as more right-wing than his old boss. Shifting between seemingly contradictory alliances, Mr. Bennett has been called an extremist and an opportunist. Allies say he is merely a pragmatist, less ideological than he appears, and lacking Mr. Netanyahu’s penchant for demonizing opponents.
In a measure of Mr. Bennett’s talents, he has now pulled off a feat that is extraordinary even by the perplexing standards of Israeli politics. He has all but maneuvered himself into the top office even though his party, Yamina, won just seven of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 120 seats</span></span> in the Parliament.
Mr. Bennett leveraged his modest but pivotal electoral weight after the inconclusive March election, Israel’s fourth in two years. He entered coalition talks as a kingmaker, and appears ready to emerge as the one wearing the crown.
Mr. Bennett has long championed West Bank settlers and once led the council representing them, though he is not a settler, himself. He is religiously observant — he would be the first prime minister to wear a kipa — but he will head a governing coalition that is largely secular.
He would lead a precarious coalition that spans Israel’s fractious political spectrum from left to right, and includes a small Arab, Islamist party — much of which opposes his ideas on settlement and annexation. That coalition proposes to paper over its differences on Israeli-Palestinian relations by focusing on domestic matters.
Mr. Bennett has explained his motives for teaming up with such ideological opposites as an act of last resort to end the political impasse that has paralyzed Israel.
“The political crisis in Israel is unprecedented on a global level,” he said in a televised speech on Sunday. “We could end up with fifth, sixth, even 10th elections, dismantling the walls of the country, brick by brick, until our house falls in on us. Or we can stop the madness and take responsibility.”
One of the most unlikely kingmakers involved in the formation of a new government is Mansour Abbas, the leader of the small Arab party known by its Hebrew acronym, Raam, with four seats in the current Parliament.
Under an 11th-hour deal, Raam formally agreed to join a Lapid-Bennett coalition government, though it would not hold any Cabinet seats. That was something of a surprise, as the party was expected to remain outside the coalition, while supporting it in a confidence vote in the Parliament. Some Arab lawmakers played a similar role by supporting Yitzhak Rabin’s government from the outside in the 1990s.
For decades, Arab parties have not been directly involved in Israeli governments. They have been mostly shunned by other parties, and are leery of joining a government that oversees occupation of the Palestinian territories and Israel’s military actions.
But after decades of political marginalization, many Palestinian citizens, who make up a fifth of Israel’s population, have been seeking fuller integration.
Israel’s early, leftist governments included Arab parties that were closely affiliated with the mostly Jewish parties. Raam would be the first independent Arab party in government, and the first Arab party of any kind in a right-leaning government.
Raam has been willing to work with both the pro- and anti-Netanyahu camps since the March election and to use its leverage to wrest concessions for the Arab public. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">The party has refused to commit to a deal unless it gets assurances for greater resources and rights for Israel’s Arab minority, including reforms to housing legislation that potential hard-right coalition partners do not accept.

Sitting in her office in Parliament on Wednesday afternoon, Idit Silman, a hard-right lawmaker, flicked through hundreds of recent text messages from unknown numbers.
Some were laced with abusive language. Some warned she was going to hell. All of them demanded that her party abandon coalition negotiations with an alliance of centrist, leftist and right-wing lawmakers seeking to replace Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 12 years</span>.
“It’s very hard,” Ms. Silman said. “People would rather put pressure on Idit Silman than see Benjamin Netanyahu leave Balfour Street,” she added, in a reference to the location of the prime minister’s official residence.
As opposition negotiators race to meet a midnight deadline to agree on a new government, supporters of Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud party were working overtime to pressure Ms. Silman and other members of the right-wing Yamina party.
Many right-wing Israelis see Yamina’s turn against Mr. Netanyahu as a betrayal.
This onslaught gave Ms. Silman and her colleagues pause for thought — and an incentive to be seen as prolonging the negotiations for as long as possible. Though Yamina did finally join the coalition on Wednesday night, Mr. Netanyahu’s party, Likud, is likely to continue to play on these fears.
Parliament might not hold a vote of confidence in a new government for <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another 10 days</span>, giving Mr. Netanyahu more time to persuade Yamina lawmakers to reverse course.
His party has already promised to keep goading Ms. Silman and her colleagues.
“Behind the scenes,” said a senior Likud official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, “the Likud party is ramping up the pressure, particularly on the weakest links.”
The pressure has been relentless for days, since the phone numbers of Ms. Silman and her colleagues, they say, were posted on several WhatsApp and Facebook groups. That has prompted a barrage of messages — and not just from Israelis. Evangelical pastors in the United States have weighed in, and so have Hasidic activists in Britain, among many others.
The Likud party denies accusations that it posted any numbers publicly.
When Ms. Silman turned up at her local synagogue last week, she found several slick posters outside, each with her portrait overlaid with the slogan: “Idit Silman stitched together a government with terror supporters.”
For days, protesters have picketed her home, shouted abuse at her children, and trailed her by car in a menacing fashion, she said.
Yamina’s leader, Naftali Bennett, decided to negotiate with the opposition on Sunday night, after months of wavering. His calculus was based on realism, analysts say: Mr. Netanyahu cannot form a coalition, even with Mr. Bennett’s support. So Mr. Bennett can either fall in with the opposition, who have offered him the chance to be prime minister — or force the country to a fifth election in little more than two years.
“We always ask ourselves this question,” Ms. Silman said on Wednesday afternoon. “Is it right? Can we do something else?”
Patrick Kingsley and
Naftali Bennett, who leads a small right-wing party, and Yair Lapid, the centrist leader of the Israeli opposition, have joined forces to try to form a diverse coalition to unseat Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister.
Spanning Israel’s fractious political spectrum from left to right, and relying on the support of a small Arab, Islamist party, the proposed coalition, dubbed the “change government” by supporters, could signal a profound shift for Israel. Its leaders have pledged to end the cycle of divisive politics and inconclusive elections.
The opposition parties announced a coalition agreement on Wednesday. But even if they survive a vote of confidence in the Parliament and form a government, toppling Mr. Netanyahu, how much change would their “change government” bring, when some of the parties agree on little else besides antipathy for Israel’s longest-serving leader?
Mr. Bennett, whose party won seven seats in Parliament, is often described as further to the right than Mr. Netanyahu. While Mr. Netanyahu eroded the idea of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr. Bennett, a religiously observant champion of Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, openly rejects the concept of a sovereign Palestinian state and has advocated annexing West Bank territory.
Still, though the coalition will include several parties that disagree on both those issues, they have agreed to allow Mr. Bennett to become prime minister first.
If the coalition deal holds, Mr. Bennett would be replaced for the second part of the four-year term by Mr. Lapid, who advocates for secular, middle-class Israelis and whose party <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">won 17 seats</span>.
By conceding the first turn in the rotation, Mr. Lapid, who has been branded as a dangerous leftist by his opponents on the right, smoothed the way for other right-wing politicians to join the new anti-Netanyahu alliance.
In a measure of the plot twists and tumult behind this political turnaround, Mr. Bennett had pledged before the election not to enable a Lapid government of any kind or any government reliant on the Islamist party, called Raam.
The coalition would stand or fall on the cooperation between eight parties with disparate ideologies and, on many issues, clashing agendas.
In a televised address on Sunday night, Mr. Bennett said he was committed to fostering national unity.
“Two thousand years ago, there was a Jewish state which fell here because of internal quarrels,” he said. “This will not happen again. Not on my watch.”
<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Even as the country and its Parliament remained deeply divided over the formation of a new government, Israeli lawmakers came together on Wednesday to elect a new president, Isaac Herzog, a former leader of the Labor party and government minister.
</span>Displaying a rare degree of consensus in a secret ballot, they voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Herzog, who currently serves as the chairman of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency for Israel, which helps deal with immigration, interacts with the Jewish diaspora and runs social programs.
The president plays a mostly symbolic role as a national unifier in Israel’s fractious parliamentary democracy, where the prime minister wields the most power.
One of a president’s main responsibilities is to grant a candidate the task of forming a government after elections. In Israel’s current, fragmented politics, which have produced four inconclusive elections in two years, that involves more than the usual level of skill, legal interpretation and discretion.
The president can also play an important role in Israeli diplomacy and has the power to pardon convicted criminals and exercise clemency by reducing or commuting sentences.

Less than a month ago, an eruption of intense fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip plunged Israeli and Palestinian communities into chaos. As the civilian casualties grew, overwhelmingly on the Gaza side, the conflict polarized Israeli society, and the world, in ways seldom seen before.
At <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 230 people</span> were killed in Gaza during the war, including at <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 65 children</span>, while in Israel at <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 12 were</span> killed, including two children. Gaza’s infrastructure, already ailing, was gutted by Israeli airstrikes on the densely populated territory. And Israeli towns and cities within range of Hamas rockets went into repeated, frightening lockdowns in shelters.
The war also spurred unrest within Israel and the occupied territories that has been more explosive than any in years. It has inspired a new era of Palestinian activism, and has shifted the ground politically, coloring the drama that was playing out in Israel on Wednesday.
Here is what to know about the 11-day war, and its lasting effects.
JERUSALEM — For Israelis, the possible downfall of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the country’s longest-serving leader, is an epochal moment. Israeli media have barraged their audiences with reports and commentary on the opposition attempts to form a government.
But for many Palestinians, the political drama has prompted little more than a shrug and a resurgence of bitter memories.
During Mr. Netanyahu’s current 12-year tenure, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process fizzled, as Israeli and Palestinian leaders accused each other of obstructing the process, and Mr. Netanyahu expressed increasing skepticism about the possibility of a sovereign Palestinian state.
But to many Palestinians, his likely replacement as prime minister, Naftali Bennett, would be no improvement. Mr. Bennett is Mr. Netanyahu’s former chief of staff, and a former settler leader who outright rejects Palestinian statehood.
Instead, many Palestinians are consumed by their own political moment, which some activists have framed as the most pivotal in decades.
The Palestinian polity has long been physically and politically fragmented between the American-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank; its archrival, Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza; a Palestinian minority inside Israel whose votes might make or break an Israeli government; and a sprawling diaspora.
But spurred by last month’s 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and the worst bout of intercommunal Arab-Jewish violence to have convulsed Israel in decades, these disparate parts suddenly came together in a seemingly leaderless eruption of shared identity and purpose.
In a rare display of unity, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians observed a general strike on <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 12 across</span> Gaza, the West Bank, the refugee camps of Lebanon and inside Israel itself.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“I don’t think whoever is in charge in Israel will make a great deal of difference to the Palestinians,” said Ahmad Aweidah, the former head of the Palestinian stock exchange.</span> “There might be slight differences and nuances, but all mainstream Israeli parties, with slight exceptions on the extreme left, share pretty much the same ideology.”
The strike in mid-May, Mr. Aweidah said, “showed that we are united no matter what the Israelis have tried to do <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 73 years</span>: categorizing us into Israeli Arabs, West Bankers, Jerusalemites, Gazans, refugees and diaspora.”

May’s increase was driven in part by sharp rises in the prices for energy, which <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 34.6% from</span> a year earlier, and groceries, which <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">jumped 11.9% on</span> the year, the biggest increase <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1979.</span></span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">But inflation pressures were distinctly broad-based in May, said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.

</span>“Given everything from the implications of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Chinese lockdowns and just the sheer appetite for travel...what we’ve seen is the perfect storm of those factors hitting, along with some major refinery closures,” she said. “Inflationary pressures were seen nearly everywhere.”

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The inflation news hit stock and bond prices, with investors’ fearing the Federal Reserve could be forced to act more aggressively to tame surging price increases.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Prices for used cars and trucks—a key engine of the past year’s inflation surge—<span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 1.8% in</span> May from April, reversing three months of declines.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Shelter costs, an indicator of broad inflation pressures, accelerated on a monthly basis in May and were <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 5.5%,</span> compared with a year ago.

</span>Airline fares <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 12.6% on</span> the month, the third straight double-digit rise.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">“We suspect that the formidable momentum in inflation could push the headline rate for CPI close <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 9% as</span> early as next month,” said Ms. House, adding that it is likely to stay near those levels through the autumn.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">The May inflation figures came as consumer sentiment soured further on the economy.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">The preliminary estimate of the consumer sentiment index published Friday by the University of Michigan fell <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 50.2 in</span> June <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 58.4 in</span> May, marking its lowest reading on record.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Nearly half of those surveyed attributed their negative views to inflation, up <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 38% the</span> prior month, and long-term inflation expectations rose to the highest level <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span>

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">High inflation is a downside of strong U.S. growth, fueled in part by low interest rates and government stimulus to counter the Covid-19 pandemic’s impact.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">The annual rate of inflation has risen sharply since <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2021,</span> when the U.S. economy’s rebound from the pandemic accelerated, leading to supply disruptions and other imbalances that put upward pressure on prices for longer than policy makers anticipated.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">Economists and policy makers had been watching closely for signs that inflationary pressures are ebbing.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">But May’s resurgence in price increases ratchets up pressure on the Fed to raise rates aggressively to tame inflation, said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">“The breadth of inflation pressures in the economy should alarm the Fed,” he said.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">On a monthly basis, the CPI jumped a seasonally <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">adjusted 1% in</span> May after <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rising 0.3% in</span> the prior month.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">The so-called core-price index, which excludes the often volatile categories of food and energy, <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">increased 0.6% on</span> the month, the same as in April.</span> That compares with an average monthly gain <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 0.2% for</span> both measures in the two years before the pandemic.

<span id=""22"" class=""red"">On a 12-month basis, the core-price index <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">increased 6% in</span> May, down <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 6.2% in</span> April.</span> March’<span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 6.5% rise</span> was the highest rate since <span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">August 1982.</span>

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">Inflation was highest in the South, <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 9.2%,</span> and the Midwest, where prices <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 8.8%.</span></span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Residents of the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater area of Florida swallowed <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">an 11.3% increase</span> over <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 12 months</span> ended in May, driven in part by a sharp rise in rental prices.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Inflation was <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 6.3% in</span> the New York City metropolitan area, due in part to relatively low rental-price gains.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">“I understand inflation is a real challenge to American families,” said President Biden, speaking at the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, Calif.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">He added the administration would do “everything we can to lower prices for the American people and Congress has to act,” and cited efforts to reduce backlogs of supplies at U.S. ports.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Energy prices rose in May as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continued to push up prices for crude-oil and natural gas.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">Gasoline prices have breached record levels in recent weeks.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">The average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gas in the U.S. <span id=""56"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">hit $5 Friday</span> night, according to OPIS, an energy-data and analytics provider.

</span><span id=""31"" class=""red"">The strength in energy price rises will keep putting upward pressure on inflation, said Ms. House, the Wells Fargo economist.

</span>Consumers’ grocery bills have risen by an annual rate of more <span id=""57"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10% since</span> earlier this year, a pace last seen in the early 1980s. <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Food price increases are unusually broad, and every single grocery category measured in the report rose in May from a year ago—most of them by double digits.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">There are numerous causes, unlike early in the pandemic when meat prices drove much of the increase, said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.

</span>“It’s not just the weather—it’s diseases affecting citrus trees and chickens. <span id=""34"" class=""red"">It’s the Ukraine conflict,” which has affected prices for baked goods and cereals, he said.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">Drought, too, is hitting prices for vegetables and other crops.

</span>“For people on lower incomes, this is not discretionary spending,” Mr. Ashworth said. “Other than substituting out cheaper food types—cheaper meat cuts, whatever it might be—people need to continue buying food.”

<span id=""36"" class=""red"">Price pressures are strong across much of the economy in part because of an unusually tight U.S. labor market, with demand for workers outstripping supply.</span> <span id=""37"" class=""red"">Employers <span id=""58"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">added 390,000 jobs</span> last month, and the unemployment rate hovered near a half-century low.</span> <span id=""38"" class=""red"">Still, even after the economy gained more <span id=""59"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 6.5 million</span> jobs in the space of a year, fewer Americans are employed as a share of the population than before the pandemic.

</span><span id=""39"" class=""red"">Those dynamics are driving wage growth, adding to inflationary pressures.</span> <span id=""40"" class=""red"">Strong gains in wages and hiring are pumping more money into Americans’ bank accounts, propping up demand as inflation erodes spending power for many.</span> <span id=""41"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, higher labor costs stemming from worker shortages are prompting many employers to raise prices.

</span><span id=""42"" class=""red"">Demand for travel and other services has surged as the impact of Covid-19 recedes and people spend more freely on experiences they missed out on during the worst of the pandemic.</span> <span id=""43"" class=""red"">This is pushing up prices for these services.</span> <span id=""44"" class=""red"">Airline fares <span id=""60"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">surged 37.8% from</span> a year ago, while hotel prices <span id=""61"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 19.3% higher</span>.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">Restaurant prices <span id=""62"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 7.4%,</span> the sharpest rise <span id=""63"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1981.</span>

</span><span id=""46"" class=""red"">Despite strong demand for summer activities such as travel, higher prices are eating into many business owners’ profitability.</span> In <span id=""64"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2020,</span> Suzanne Hoffman, an author who runs wine tours in Italy, canceled group tours to Piedmont because of the pandemic. A number of guests rolled over their deposits and are finally taking their trips this summer.

<span id=""47"" class=""red"">“The demand is there; people are just champing at the bit,” said Ms. Hoffman, who is based in Edwards, Colo.

</span><span id=""48"" class=""red"">But the people taking those long-delayed trips are <span id=""65"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paying 2019 prices</span>, she said, while fuel, dining and other costs to conduct the tours have gone up.</span> That is hurting Ms. Hoffman’s bottom line to the extent that she might stop running future tours given the uncertain outlook.

“I canceled my October tour. I just don’t want to make any commitments beyond this summer,” she said.

<span id=""49"" class=""red"">Some main drivers of inflation could be easing.

</span><span id=""50"" class=""red"">The backlog in cargo ships waiting to unload in Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., fell for the fourth straight month in May, said Oren Klachkin of Oxford Economics.</span> Target Corp. recently said the need to unload unwanted goods would cause its profit to drop. Clothes retailers have also been caught with swelling inventories of casual clothes and home items as shoppers scaled back spending on goods that had been popular throughout the pandemic.

<span id=""51"" class=""red"">But supply bottlenecks are easing too slowly and too sporadically to ease inflationary pressures, economists say.</span> <span id=""52"" class=""red"">Energy disruptions caused by the Ukraine war and the lack of workers to fill vacancies in the U.S. are exacerbating strains on the economy’s ability to meet demand without price rises.

</span><span id=""53"" class=""red"">The breadth and persistence of these supply problems means that for inflation to ease, demand must come down, said Mr. Knightley of ING.</span> <span id=""54"" class=""red"">“To get demand into better balance with the supply the onus is on the Federal Reserve to do the heavy lifting,” he said.

Dec.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 11</span>:00 pm ET

NINGDE, China—The price of nickel, a metal used to make stainless steel for everything from sauce pans to guitar strings, spiked <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">past $50,000 a</span> metric ton <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2007 from</span> less <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $10,000 just</span> a few years earlier.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">With nickel largely controlled by Western companies, China's swelling economy was especially vulnerable—until some of its steel producers figured out how to substitute a lower-grade ""nickel pig iron,"" unlocking a mother lode of cheap supply.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The innovation has sent nickel prices tumbling to less <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $14,000 a</span> metric ton, and turned China into a leading nickel producer.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">The country now turns out more <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 400,000 metric</span> tons of nickel pig iron a year, equal to a fifth of world-wide demand.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Economists for years warned that rising demand for natural resources by China and other emerging markets would outstrip supply, leaving the world short of everything from nickel to coal, copper and corn.

</span>But a remarkable period of innovation and investment has produced a far different picture. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Expanded supply has helped moderate commodity prices over the past year after a decade of demand from China helped push many prices into the stratosphere.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The International Monetary Fund's index of all commodity prices is down <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 12% from</span> recent peaks; it had roughly tripled <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Between 2000 and</span></span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2011.</span></span> Copper is <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 28% from</span> its record high <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2011,</span> while thermal coal has fallen by more than half since <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2008 peak</span>.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">Of course, price declines are also driven by weaker demand, especially in China, where economic growth has slowed.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">And prices for many commodities, including oil, remain far above their average <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 10 or</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 15 years</span> ago.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">But the global supply picture is the best in years.</span> ""It's kind of basic econ 101: Scarcity induces some sort of innovation,"" said David Jacks, an associate professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who has studied commodity cycles over the past century.

The most widely known innovation is the oil-field technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which fueled the shale boom by injecting water and other materials into the earth to unlock oil and natural gas.

But in agriculture, farmers are tapping new patches of arable land, and turning to higher-yielding hybrid seeds.

In the mining industry, drilling companies are using diamond-coated drill bits to reach miles farther beneath the earth's surface. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">They also employ aircraft radar to map the geology of remote areas.</span> Firms that mix chemicals into minerals to make desired metals rise to the top or sink to the bottom now extract more product than ever from lower-grade deposits.

On top of all that, many projects that were funded years ago—including new or expanded copper, silver and nickel mines—have started producing.

As as result, mine production has nearly doubled or tripled for every major metal over the past two decades, according to the U.S. Geological Survey and other organizations.

<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Between 2000 and</span></span><span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012,</span> aluminum output increased <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 45.7 million</span> metric tons <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 24.7 million</span>, according to the Raw Materials Group Stockholm, a consultancy. Production of iron ore, used in steelmaking, hit two billion metric tons from <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 975 million</span> over the same period.

Global production of corn, meanwhile, rose by <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 270 million</span> metric tons over the past decade, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. That growth was the biggest 10-year increase on record and more than triple the gains of the previous decade.

Output of palm oil, used in cookies and instant noodles, has more than doubled since the start of the last decade, and so has the harvest of walnuts and almonds.

All this expanded production has often come with environmental costs, which in various places include air pollution, clear-cut forests and water tainted by chemicals.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">And it remains unclear how the world can sustain the commodity-production gains still needed to meet future demand.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Per capita consumption of energy and other resources in China remains lower than in the West, which means more production increases will be needed in the future as the Chinese economy grows.</span> Many easy-to-reach minerals have been exhausted, likely raising future production costs.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">But innovations of the past decade show how market signals help unlock new supply.</span> The period compares with advances in copper production during the 1920s, Mr. Jacks said. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">And demand during World War II led to the expansion of synthetic rubber production.

</span>Minerals companies, for example, have improved the chemical process to extract raw materials from waste rock. Rio Tinto in Utah extracts silver, gold and molybdenum from the muddy sludge that is a byproduct of mining copper. In Minnesota, a company called Magnetation Inc. has developed machines that use magnets to extract iron ore from mining waste.

China's nickel production is one of the most dramatic examples of fresh thinking. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">In the early 2000s, prices were <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below $10,000 per</span> metric ton.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Then China's economy took off, along with new demand for stainless steel, which requires nickel and iron.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Nickel prices <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">surpassed $51,000 per</span> ton in mid-2007.

</span>Chinese stainless steel producers were furious, especially since much of the world's nickel supplies were dominated by such foreign companies as BHP Billiton Ltd., Vale SA of Brazil, and Russia's MMC Norilsk Nickel.

Most nickel production at the time came from so-called sulfide deposits in places like Canada and Russia, where mines were being depleted.

There were plenty of lower-grade laterite deposits in Indonesia and elsewhere. It could be refined into nickel pig iron, which contains a relatively small portion of nickel—usually less than 15%—mixed with iron. But processing the laterite ore required lots of energy and created lots of pollution.

<span id=""18"" class=""red"">Analysts figured it <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">cost $20,000 or</span> more per metric ton to make nickel pig iron, more than double the market price for nickel in the early 2000s.</span> Mining companies often tossed laterite nickel aside.

<span id=""19"" class=""red"">But when nickel prices climbed, China saw a competitive advantage: it still had scores of old, inefficient blast furnaces.</span> Beijing had been pressing steelmakers to shut them down. But with some fine-tuning, the blast furnaces could refine laterite ore into nickel pig iron, which can be used to make some steel alloys, including stainless steel.

Early Chinese producers burned coal, oil, wood chips and other materials to refine the laterite, which came mostly from Indonesia. The final product had only a small amount of nickel, but also iron, both needed ingredients.

<span id=""20"" class=""red"">As prices continued to climb, nickel pig iron became economical, and furnaces along China's eastern coast were put to work.

</span>The Tsingshan Holding Group was among the leaders. As one of China's major producers of stainless steel, it needed lots of nickel.

The company was encouraged by early trials with nickel pig iron, but the refining process was still crude and dirty. So Tsingshan began experiments, including at a plant near Ningde, a coastal town in Fujian province surrounded by low green mountains and grape farms.

The company tried rotary kiln electric furnaces, which use less energy than blast furnaces and can extract more nickel from the ore.

Many people were skeptical, said John Li, a Tsingshan-subsidiary vice president in Ningde. One day, he said, a furnace started leaking iron slag everywhere.

But the process eventually succeeded, trimming electricity needs by as much <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 40%,</span> said Jiang Xinfang, president-director of another Tsingshan subsidiary in Shanghai. Tsingshan now pumps out nickel pig iron <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 11% nickel</span>, the company said, compared <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 2% or</span> less using older techniques.

""At its core, this is a sort of revolution in the way nickel units are made,"" said Andrew Shaw, a commodities analyst at Credit Suisse in Singapore.

Tsingshan now gets about half the nickel it needs from its own nickel pig iron, Mr. Li said. At its Ningde-area operations, a port unloads ships of Indonesian ore, which is piled in tall dark-brown mounds that cover an area roughly the size of a football field.

<span id=""21"" class=""red"">Later, the ore is transferred to a smelting plant where it is fed into a tangle of rust-colored pipes, smokestacks and rotating kilns for conversion into liquid nickel pig iron.

</span>A blanket of foul-smelling smog envelops areas near Tsingshan's operation, though there are many other factories nearby, making it hard to know where all the pollution comes from. Some residents blame the pig iron plant.

Analysts say mining of Indonesian ore involves destructive stripping of the land in that country, as well.

But the rotary-kiln process has made refining significantly cleaner, according to analysts. Mr. Jiang at Tsingshan said his company's newest-generation operations include antidust equipment and low-sulfur coal.

Tsingshan's breakthroughs have been replicated across China. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">As nickel pig iron technology has improved, analysts say, the cost of processing it has fallen to as low <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $12,500 per</span> metric ton.

</span>""There's been this huge deflationary effect on the nickel industry as nickel pig iron has developed,"" said Gayle Berry, an analyst at Barclays in London. ""It certainly has destroyed the world"" for traditional nickel, added Jim Lennon, a nickel expert and consultant to Australia's Macquarie Bank, though supplies could tighten again in the future.

<span id=""23"" class=""red"">One concern for producers is that Indonesia may restrict exports of nickel ore next year to entice mining companies to build refining operations there.</span> Tsingshan is one of several companies taking steps to do so.

<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, Western miners are scrambling to deal with the new supply.</span> Analysts estimated that as much <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 40% of</span> the nickel mining industry is losing money these days. <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Some predict China will keep finding ways to supply its own needs.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive of Glencore-Xstrata, the world's fourth-largest nickel miner, said earlier this year he was pessimistic about the metal's future price.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">In October, his company announced it would mothball its Falcondo mine in the Dominican Republic because of falling nickel prices, eliminating as many <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 1,000 jobs</span>.</span> The company mines nickel ore in five countries, including Indonesia and sells much of it to China to make nickel pig iron.

""China is becoming self-sufficient"" in nickel, said Vladimir Potanin, chief executive of Norilsk, the world's top nickel producer. ""They are producing steel, which they need for their industrial development. They need this nickel pig iron close to where the steel is made. I think they're smart enough, and powerful enough to keep doing both forever.""

Mr. Li, of the Tsingshan subsidiary, was pleased with his country's revamping of nickel production, with benefits extending around the world. ""If we didn't have this nickel process in China,"" he said. <span id=""28"" class=""red"">""I think prices would <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">be $80,000.</span></span>""

Updated Aug.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2022 11</span>:10 am ET

The U.K.’s annual rate of inflation moved into double digits in July and is set to rise even higher by the end of the year, heaping greater pressure on stretched household budgets and threatening a lengthy economic contraction.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">That pickup in inflation has been replicated in other parts of Europe, even as consumer prices have started to slow in the U.S.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">That is because energy prices have continued to accelerate across Europe as Russia withholds supplies of natural gas, with the continent facing a possible crunch this winter.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The U.K.’s Office for National Statistics Wednesday said consumer prices <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 10.1% higher</span> in July than a year earlier, up <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 9.4% in</span> June.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">That was the highest rate of inflation in more than four decades and the fastest increase in prices recorded in one of the Group of Seven rich countries since the current surge started in <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2021.</span>

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">“Inflation figures continue to paint a worrying picture for consumers and businesses alike, and price pressures are set to build further,” said Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the Confederation of British Industry.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Figures to be released Thursday by the European Union’s statistics agency are expected to show the eurozone’s annual rate of inflation rose <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 8.9% in</span> July <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 8.6% in</span> June.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">By contrast, U.S. inflation eased <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 8.5% in</span> July <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 9.1% in</span> June.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Economists at JPMorgan see increasing signs that global inflation is set to ease, with prices of food and many commodities down from recent peaks.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">However, they expect that disinflation to be evident first in the U.S., with Europe set to lag behind despite some recent easing in the prices of goods leaving factory gates.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">“Europe, however, faces ongoing pressure from surging natural gas prices that have more than doubled over the past three months,” they wrote in a note to clients.</span> “We expect the combined drag of a squeeze on purchasing power and depressed sentiment to tip the region into recession this year.”

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">July is unlikely to mark the peak in U.K. inflation, since household energy costs are set to rise sharply when a cap on prices is lifted in October.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The Bank of England estimates that could send the annual rate of inflation <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 13% as</span> the year draws to a close.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">The U.K. is suffering a particularly severe surge in prices in part because of <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 2016 decision</span> to leave the European Union, which has caused costs for importers to increase, while a weaker pound has also raised the prices of goods and services purchased overseas.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Brexit has also reduced the availability of foreign workers in some lower-paid services industries, such as hospitality, pushing costs and prices higher.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">However, the U.K. might not be the only one of Europe’s three G-7 members set to face the double-digit inflation that has already hit Spain, Greece and a number of the EU’s eastern members.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Germany’s gas regulator Monday announced a surcharge on gas prices designed to cover most of the increased costs to home energy suppliers since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Economists estimate that will send Germany’s annual rate of inflation <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 10% from</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7.5% in</span> July.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">U.K. figures released Tuesday by the ONS showed wages excluding bonuses <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were 4.7% higher</span> in the three months through June than a year earlier, a pickup from <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 4.4% rate</span> of growth recorded in the three months through May.

Much of the pickup came from the private sector, where wages were <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5.</span>9% when</span> bonuses are included.</span> Many businesses are giving workers one-off payments to help cover surging energy and food costs, as well as standard pay rises. <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Labor union Unite on Monday said British Airways had agreed to pay its check-in staff a lump sum equivalent <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 5% of</span> their salaries this month, with a <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">regular 5% pay</span> rise to follow in September, and a <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">further 3% increase</span> in January.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">“Like most other workers, our members in BA are struggling with the cost of living crisis,” said Oliver Richardson, a Unite official.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">The acceleration in wage rises will worry the Bank of England, which wants to avert a self-reinforcing series of wage and price rises of the kind that kept inflation high for many years in the 1970s.

</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Investors now expect the central bank to raise its key interest rate by a half percentage point when policy makers next meet in mid-September, having broken with a quarter-century tradition of only increasing borrowing costs by a quarter point in each step earlier this month.

</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">“Today’s ugly inflation print combined with the stronger earnings read should keep the MPC on track to deliver multiple 50bps hikes this year,” said Sanjay Raja, an economist at Deutsche Bank.</span> “Relative to our base case, risks are tilted to an even more front-loaded and protracted hiking cycle.”

<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Even as it picked up, wage growth fell further behind the rate of inflation, with the result that real wages <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 4.1%,</span> the largest decline since records began <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2001.</span></span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">That blow to consumer spending threatens to push the economy into an even deeper contraction than the central bank already expects.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">The European Central Bank is also seeking to strike a balance between tackling surging inflation and limiting the hit to the eurozone economy from higher energy prices.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">It also broke with recent practice by raising its key rate by a half percentage point in July, and many economists expect it to repeat that move next month.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">The U.K. government has already announced three packages of support to help households meet higher energy bills without having to cut back on other essentials, but economists expect a fourth package to follow the election of a new prime minister early next month.

</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">The government’s response to what has become known as the cost-of-living crisis has been on hold since Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ousted as head of the ruling Conservative Party in early July, and the lengthy process of choosing his successor is due to end on Sept.<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 5.</span>

</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">“We’ll prepare all the options, ready for the incoming prime minister so that they can hit the ground running on what more we can do,” said Nadhim Zahawi, the U.K.’s Treasury chief.

</span>The German government, and others in Europe, are also considering additional support for households that face skyrocketing energy costs.

“We’re putting together another relief package,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote in a tweet Monday. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">“We don’t leave anyone alone with the higher costs.”

611132b18e9901b4cf5d24a6,88390,"<h3>Inside Mitch McConnell’s decades-long effort to block gun control</h3>Mitch McConnell was just finishing up his first term as the junior senator from Kentucky when a mass shooting rocked his hometown of Louisville.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">On Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 14,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1989,</span> a disgruntled employee entered the Standard Gravure printing plant in downtown Louisville and, armed with an AK-47 and other guns, killed eight and <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">wounded 12 others</span> before taking his own life — in what remains the deadliest mass shooting in the state’s history.

</span>At the time, mass shootings had not yet become the staple of American life that they are now, and McConnell said he was “deeply disturbed,” declaring, “We must take action to stop such vicious crimes.”

But he also added: “We need to be careful about legislating in the middle of a crisis.” And in the days and weeks after, he did not join others in calling for a ban on assault weapons like the AK-47 used by the shooter.

The Standard Gravure massacre provided an early glimpse of how McConnell — now the Republican Senate minority leader — would handle mass shootings and their aftermath over the next three decades, consistently working to delay, obstruct or prevent most major gun-control legislation from passing Congress.

McConnell would go on to follow a similar playbook time and time again during his seven terms in Congress, offering vague promises of action, often without any specifics, only to be followed by no action or incremental measures that avoided new gun regulations. As a Republican leader, he also helped dissuade his conference — as after <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2012 mass</span> shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. — from supporting gun legislation and, as majority leader, refused to bring up significant gun-control measures for a vote.

Now, the latest devastating and high-profile mass shootings — a massacre Tuesday at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Tex., that <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">left 19 students</span> and two teachers dead, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 10 days</span> after a racist slaughter at Buffalo supermarket that <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">killed 10 </span>— have thrust Congress back into a fiery debate over what, if anything, lawmakers can do to curb gun violence.

On Thursday, McConnell told CNN that he had encouraged Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) to reach out to Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) — who made gun control a personal project after Sandy Hook — to begin discussing what bipartisan measures might be possible.

But many Democrats and anti-gun advocates remain skeptical, predicting that McConnell and his fellow Republicans are poised to obstruct any consequential gun-violence-prevention bills yet again.

“If there’s any one individual in the United States to blame for our inability to put things in place to prevent gun violence, it’s Mitch McConnell,” said Peter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords, a group devoted to fighting gun violence. “McConnell understands he’s hostage to that extreme base that just doesn’t tolerate any departure from any of their views.”

Many Republicans say that McConnell is less a singular obstacle than a savvy leader who is able to his read his conference and make decisions that help his senators and protect them politically. “McConnell knows where his members stand and makes the tough calls to protect their interests,” a senior Republican aide said, explaining McConnell’s overall motivations in addressing gun violence and gun legislation.

McConnell declined to comment.

<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1990,</span> the year after the Standard Gravure shooting, McConnell was up for reelection and found himself in a close race with Democrat Harvey Sloane, then the Jefferson County judge executive and a former Louisville mayor, who had called for banning assault weapons.

<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2013,</span> following Sandy Hook, Sloane recounted in Louisville’s Courier-Journal newspaper that as his race with McConnell tightened in the final stretch, McConnell and the National Rifle Association “blistered the state falsely as to how this ban would eventually take away ‘your hunting gun and the hand pistol you need for personal protection.’ ”

McConnell defeated Sloane by five percentage points and, in his second term in the Senate, went on to vote against both the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1993 and</span> the Federal Assault Weapons Ban <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1994.</span>

“Mitch is really Machiavellian,” Sloane said in an interview with The Washington Post last week. “He’s single-handedly held up any kind of gun legislation that’s meaningful.”

‘It didn’t change a thing’

In <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2019,</span> a group of gun-control advocates — including Kris Brown, the president of Brady, a gun violence prevention organization; Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights icon; and Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.), who lost her 17-year-old son in <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 2012 shooting</span> — gathered on the West Lawn of the Capitol for a rally in favor of tougher background checks.

After the rally, some in the group — which also included some McConnell constituents — decided to make their way to the then-majority leader’s office for what Lewis might have called “good trouble.”

“So we walked over, John Lewis kind of leading us, talking about the importance of peaceful resistance,” Brown recalled, adding that Lewis asked if someone should get Depends — a brand of adult diapers — because the group might be there for a while.

“His staffers had no idea what to do with us,” Brown said. “McConnell didn’t have the human decency to sit down with John Lewis.”

Instead, a McConnell staffer ushered the group into a conference room and met with them for over an hour. Brown said that the staffer clearly seemed moved by Lewis, telling him that she held him in high esteem, and by the victims of gun violence, who recounted their stories one after another.

“She was moved to tears, but it didn’t change a thing,” Brown said, saying the staffer essentially told the group “that it was just the wrong time to bring this bill forward.”

Doug Andres, a McConnell spokesman, said McConnell had been unable to meet with the group at the time because it was a surprise visit and he already had constituent meetings planned. He said the staffer simply explained to the group that then-President Donald Trump was unlikely to sign the bill they were pitching, and McConnell was not going to advocate for legislation he knew would fail.

For McConnell, however, the time has rarely seemed right.

Almost immediately after Sandy Hook, then-President Barack Obama tasked then-Vice President Joe Biden with putting together a robust policy response. McConnell — then the Senate minority leader — downplayed the effort.

Asked about gun-control issues on ABC’s “This Week” in <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2013 </span>— less than month after Sandy Hook — <span id=""1"" class=""red"">McConnell said he was waiting to see Biden’s proposal but did not plan to prioritize it over other issues like “spending and debt” in the coming months.

</span>Then, later that month — after Obama <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">signed 23 executive</span> orders on guns in response to the tragedy that <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">left 20 kindergartners</span> dead — McConnell recorded a robocall and sent it out to gun owners in his state.

“President Obama and his team are doing everything in their power to restrict your constitutional right to keep and bear arms,” McConnell said in the recording. “Their efforts to restrict your rights, invading your personal privacy and overstepping their bounds with executive orders, is just plain wrong.”

McConnell also refused a meeting with the Sandy Hook families, according to someone familiar with the request, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal details. But eventually, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W. Va.) and Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) negotiated a modest bipartisan background checks bill, known as Manchin-Toomey.

At the time, McConnell was still adjusting to the rise of the hard-right tea party movement in the Republican base; in <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2010 Republican</span> Senate primary in Kentucky, Rand Paul vanquished Trey Grayson, McConnell’s handpicked candidate, by riding the tea party wave in what some also viewed as a stinging rebuke of McConnell. And <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2013,</span> McConnell was already preparing for <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2014 reelection</span> bid.

When Manchin-Toomey finally came to the Senate floor for a vote in <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2013,</span> McConnell pushed his conference to oppose the bill, which ultimately <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">failed 54 to</span><span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 46,</span> falling short of <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 60 votes</span> needed for passage.

“McConnell whipped hard against it. McConnell is obsessed with protecting his right flank,” said Adam Jentleson, who at the time worked for then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), explaining why McConnell helped tank the background check bill. “It’s why he’s been able to survive as leader for so long.”

Jesse Benton — a conservative activist who managed Paul’<span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2010 Senate</span> campaign and who McConnell enlisted to manage <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2014 one</span> — said that McConnell at the time “said something to me like, ‘I hope you know I’m not planning on supporting any of this crap.' ”

“He’s not a firebrand like some of the [pro-gun] activists want, but he makes it clear to his team that he is a Second Amendment believer,” Benton said. “He respects the legislative process and the fact that there are differing opinions in his own caucus, but he works it in his own way, as only he can.”

McConnell was, at other times, willing to entertain the idea of some legislation on guns, partly as a way of releasing pressure from members of his caucus who wanted to show some legislative action after mass shootings.

But that approach has also earned him the ire of some Second Amendment advocates, some of whom ran ads against him during <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">his 2014 primary</span>.

“When the going gets tough, Mitch McConnell has always been absent from the fight,” said Dudley Brown, the president of the National Association for Gun Rights, a hard-line alternative to the NRA. “He has never stood up when it was really tough.”

‘An obstacle to taking any action’

For McConnell,<span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 opened</span> with a mass shooting at Marshall County High School near Benton, Ky., where a 15-year-old student killed two and injured more than a dozen others that January. The following month, another school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">left 17 dead</span> and drew yet another national outcry for stronger gun measures.

At the time, Trump offered messaging whiplash. In a meeting with Democratic and Republican lawmakers two weeks after Parkland, he called for “comprehensive” gun legislation and chided Republicans for being “petrified” of the NRA. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">But the next day, he hosted an NRA lobbyist in the Oval Office, declared the meeting “great” on Twitter and seemed to lose interest in working on gun legislation.

</span>Still, a McConnell aide said, the combination of the Florida and Kentucky school shootings prompted McConnell, by then the Senate majority leader, to help pass two modest bills on background checks (the Fix NICS Act) and school safety (the Stop School Violence Act).

The Fix NICS Act helped improve the criminal background checks system to make background checks more thorough and accurate, and the stopping school violence measure authorized additional funding for improving school security and early intervention and school violence prevention programs.

Another big push for gun legislation came in the summer <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2019,</span> following back-to-back shootings on Aug.<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 and</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4 at</span> a Walmart Supercenter in majority-Hispanic El Paso and in a nightlife corridor in Dayton, Ohio, which left a <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">combined 23 people</span> dead and dozens more injured.

The Democratic blowback was fierce and directed squarely at McConnell — who was again campaigning for reelection — since the House had already passed a background check bill.

“I hope that Sen. McConnell would bring the Senate back tomorrow and pass the background check bill and send it to the president,” Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown said after the shootings.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">The same day, Shannon Watts of Moms Demand Action, a gun violence prevention group, declared, “We need Mitch McConnell to allow a vote.”

</span>The Twitter account of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) retweeted both statements, and several days later, Pelosi wrote a public letter to Trump asking him to call on McConnell — whom she described as “an obstacle to taking any action” — to call the Senate back into session.

By the night of Aug.<span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4,</span> protesters had gathered outside McConnell’s Kentucky home with profane chants. Days later, dozens gathered outside his Louisville office.

That Thursday, Aug.<span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span> McConnell went on Louisville’s WHAS-AM radio to say he had spoken with Trump and was ready to take action. The president, he said, was “anxious to get an outcome, and so am I.”

“What we can’t do is fail to pass something,” McConnell said. “What I want to see here is an outcome.”

He added that background checks — which he said had “a lot of support” publicly — and red flag measures would probably lead the discussion.

But a special session was never called.

The week before returning to Washington, McConnell did an interview with Hugh Hewitt on Sept.<span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 that</span> laid out a different benchmark, deferring to Trump: “I said several weeks ago that if the president took a position on a bill so that we knew we would actually be making a law and not just having serial votes, I’d be happy to put it on the floor.”

By the time McConnell brought the Senate back in session, his focus had shifted. In his first remarks on the Senate floor, McConnell made no mention of the gun issue. Just over a week later, The Post reported on a whistleblower complaint about Trump’s communications with a foreign leader, eventually leading to Trump’s first impeachment for his efforts to withhold military aid to Ukraine — drawing Trump’s attention away from guns.

This past Wednesday, the day after the devastating Uvalde elementary school shooting, McConnell — now the Senate minority leader again — took to the Senate floor to declare himself and the nation “sickened and outraged by the senseless evil” that left at <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 19 students</span> and two teachers “murdered for no apparent reason at all.”

He did not mention guns or any possible legislation, instead focusing on the “innocent young lives” that were prematurely extinguished.

“Words simply fail,” McConnell said.

On Thursday, however, McConnell tasked Cornyn with negotiating with Democrats.

“Maybe this will provide some impetus” for compromise, Cornyn told reporters at the Capitol on Thursday. “This is horrible. Hard to imagine anything that could be worse than parents worrying about the safety of their kids going to school.”

But most Republicans signaled in recent days that major legislation remains unlikely.

“There are no right words to describe the heartbreaking and horrific tragedy that happened at Robb Elementary School,” said Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), before adding later: “We must be thoughtful about how we discuss and handle school safety and mental health issues. Federal changes should not be made in haste, and there’s still many details we do not know as the investigation continues.”

After a vigil for the Uvalde victims, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) stormed away from an interview when a British reporter asked him why mass shootings happen “only in America.” Cruz accused the reporter of having a “political agenda.”

Cruz also dismissed Democratic gun violence prevention proposals, saying that none of them would have stopped the Uvalde shooting, and later suggested legislation to “harden schools” — such as having only one usable door.

On Friday, Trump — still the de facto leader of the Republican Party — joined other Republican officials in delivering a defiant response to the Uvalde massacre at an NRA annual meeting in Houston, arguing that new gun restrictions were pointless.

Support for stricter gun laws has increased after mass shootings at schools. In <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2018,</span> shortly after the Parkland shooting,<span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 67 percent</span> said in a Gallup Poll that laws should be more strict — an increase <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 60 percent</span> who said the same in <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">October 2017.</span> Similarly, support for stricter laws jumped <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 43 percent</span> <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 58 percent</span> after the Sandy Hook shooting.

In contrast to support for gun restrictions in general, support for expanding background checks has stayed very high over time. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">A Pew Research Center poll last year <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">found 81 percent</span> of Americans supported making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks, <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 70 percent</span> of Republicans <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 92 percent</span> of Democrats.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">A 63 percent</span> majority supported a ban on assault-style weapons, <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">including 83 percent</span> of Democrats and less than half as many Republicans (37 percent).

But many gun-control advocates and Democrats remain skeptical that Republicans are prepared to change their approach. Matt Bennett — a co-founder of Third Way, a Democratic think tank — said polarized politics prevents the handful of Republicans who may privately support some gun safety laws to do so publicly.

“The ones who believe in their hearts that they should do something — and who knows how many there truly are — don’t want to do it, because they don’t want to get crosswise with the base,” Bennett said.

John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, latched onto McConnell’s declaration on the Senate floor that “words simply fail.”

He said he agrees completely.

“I don’t want to mince words. The Republican senators are what is costing American lives. And McConnell is the head of the Republican Senate,” Feinblatt said. “I am encouraged that McConnell gave the green light to Cornyn. That is what I would call step one.”

“But,” he added, “There is no question about it: Inaction is not an option.”

Updated Nov.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 21,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 6</span>:57 pm ET

An international race to lower corporate taxes is back in the global spotlight after Britain recommitted to slashing rates and as the election of Donald Trump puts U.S. corporate-tax overhauls on the front burner.

</span>U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday officially endorsed a move by Britain’s previous Conservative government to lower the main corporate rate there <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 17% by</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2020,</span> from today’<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 20%.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">President-elect Donald Trump promoted on the campaign trail <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 15% U</span>.S. headline corporate tax-rate—down from the <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">current 35%.</span>

</span>Mr. Trump’s plan is far from a done deal. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">It faces domestic political hurdles and fiscal reality.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">And Mrs. May backed a tax cut already approved by Parliament but stopped short of endorsing her predecessor’s further recommendation—made after the Brexit vote—to go down <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15%.</span>

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">Still, the rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic represent the latest volleys in a long tradition of trying to use national corporate-tax codes to spur investment at home or lure foreign firms.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The new attention being paid to corporate tax in both places follows close on the heels of recent moves in Japan, Canada, Italy and France to attract investment with lower rates of their own.

</span>For Britain, the Brexit decision has made the pressure to keep the welcome mat out especially intense. The country, in particular London, has been a magnet for global firms looking to set up European beachheads or global offices. It benefits from a convenient time zone between Asia and the Americas, strong legal protections and a large pool of well-educated, English-speaking workers.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">But after Britain’s <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 23 vote</span> to leave the European Union, many companies based there have scrambled to assess whether they will continue to benefit from two other, big advantages that come with EU membership: unfettered access to Europe’s common market and the free movement of labor across the bloc.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Britain’s Institute of Directors, a group of company directors and senior business leaders, found in a poll shortly after the vote that more than a fifth of respondents said they were considering moving some of their operations outside the U.K. because of the vote.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Mrs. May has tried to assure British and foreign companies that the U.K. will continue to be a competitive place to do business.</span> Her charm offensive has included closed-door meetings with corporate heads such as Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Nissan Motor Co., the second-largest car maker in the U.K. Mr. Ghosn had considered passing over Sunderland and picking a factory in continental Europe to build a new model, but he backtracked after meeting with Mrs. May.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Mrs. May’s announcement, made in a speech to U.K. business leaders, reassured companies that she was still prepared to carry through on the tax reductions approved by Parliament during her predecessor’s government.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">She didn’t mention a specific tax-cutting target.

</span>That left unclear whether she would be willing to embrace a further cut <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 15%,</span> which was proposed—but never acted upon—by then-Prime Minister David Cameron’s government in the immediate wake of the Brexit vote. An aide to Mrs. May said only she was committed to the plans already in place to cut the rate <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2020 to</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17%.</span>

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Still, business leaders took it as a strong signal of support for keeping corporate tax low.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">“It’s good to see the government reaffirm its commitment to lower corporation tax,” said a spokesman for the Confederation of British Industry, a trade group.

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">The plan to gradually move to <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 17% corporate</span>-tax rate would give Britain the lowest headline corporate-tax rate among the Group <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 20,</span> a collection of the world’s richest nations.</span> At the <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">current 20%,</span> its headline rate is already one of the lowest in the G-20, equal to that of Turkey, Russia and Saudi Arabia. <span id=""14"" class=""red""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">At 17%,</span> it would still be above Ireland’<span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 12.5%,</span> but well below most other large economies.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">It might also be at the limit of what Britain’s finances can stand.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">“Britain has a large deficit and is very constrained on how much tax-cutting it can do,” said Charles Beer, managing director of independent tax advisory Taxand in Britain.</span> He said the government could speed up implementing <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 17% rate</span>, “but it’s hard to see how they can do a major move down.”

Vodafone Group PLC said in the days immediately after the June vote that it might have to reconsider its U.K. headquarters. It has since backtracked, saying it is happy to be British based. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">A spokesman declined to comment on Mrs. May’s tax pledge.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The race to lower corporate taxes comes amid a broader tax shake-up that has played out over recent years.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Almost 100 countries</span>, including the U.S. and most of Europe, have agreed to close—or at least narrow—legal loopholes that big companies use to shift profits to places where they pay little or no income tax.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">EU regulators have also taken aim at tailor-made tax deals between certain member countries and companies.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">“Once those loopholes are closed the main way countries can compete is by lowering their base corporate tax rate,” said Paolo Giacometti, a partner at Italian law firm Chiomenti.</span> “So we will see this trend continue.”

<span id=""22"" class=""red"">It is often hard to compare corporate-tax rates in an apples-to-apples fashion.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Some countries have wider corporate-tax bases, for instance, or charge different rates for different-sized companies.</span> Companies also have to contend with an array of regional taxes, such as U.S. state taxes. Still, the national rate is often the easiest-to-convey message of welcome—or warning—a government can send to corporate executives.

Germany and Ireland made big cuts at the beginning of this century in a bid to attract corporate investment. <span id=""24"" class=""red"">Berlin clawed back much of what it lost in revenue by making it harder for companies to take deductions.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">Ireland’s sharp headline corporate-tax cuts early in the decade helped it become one of Europe’s most attractive destinations for many companies looking for European or global headquarters.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">But it is also now pulling back on other corporate-tax benefits.</span> Two years ago, for instance, Dublin said it would end <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2020 a</span> gambit it called the “Double Irish.” <span id=""27"" class=""red"">The structure allowed multinationals to lower their taxable profit in one Irish subsidiary by paying royalties into another Irish-registered subsidiary that was managed in a tax haven—making it exempt from Irish income tax.

</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">Italy in <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2015 moved</span> to lower its national corporate tax rate <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 3.5 percentage</span> points, <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 24%.</span></span> That reduction takes effect next year. Even France, long a holdout, has embraced the trend in the past few years, though rates in the country are still higher than in most of Europe.

Japan, struggling to promote growth as the country’s population ages, has been cutting the rate to encourage investment. This year, the rate <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fell 2 percentage</span> points <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 30%,</span> bringing the drop <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 10 points</span> in just a few years.

In the U.S., however, the policy debate has been stalled for years, despite bipartisan consensus to lower corporate taxes. <span id=""29"" class=""red"">The U.S. rate is now the world’s highest, though effective tax rates are lower than <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 35% marginal</span> rate.</span> House Republicans have proposed <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 20% rate</span>, saying they want to leapfrog other countries that have been reducing their rates more incrementally. President Barack Obama several years ago proposed <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 28% rate</span> <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 25% for</span> manufacturers.

<span id=""30"" class=""red"">Unlike many other countries, the U.S. doesn’t have a value-added tax—akin to a federal sales tax—that it can increase while cutting the corporate tax rate.</span> <span id=""31"" class=""red"">That means Washington has had to look for offsetting revenue elsewhere.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">All the likely sources—a broader corporate tax base, higher taxes on small businesses and wider budget deficits—are politically problematic.

611132b18e9901b4cf5d24a6,28411,"<h3>Pinkerton: Why Buying Greenland Is One of Donald Trump’s Best Ideas</h3>Last week, the Wall Street Journal had a scoop of sorts; the headline read, “President Trump Eyes a New Real-Estate Purchase: Greenland: In conversations with aides, the president has — with varying degrees of seriousness — floated the idea of the U.S. buying the autonomous Danish territory.”
Greenland, of course, is a huge island in the Atlantic, most of it north of the Arctic Circle. As such, even though it <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">boasts 836,000 square</span> miles of territory — more than a quarter the size of the continental U.S. — it counts a population of <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 55,000.</span>
In other words, the great landmass is ripe for development, so it’s no wonder Trump, real estate man, wants to take a crack at developing it — on behalf of the nation, if not for himself. Indeed, wits were quick to riff on what a Trumpified Greenland would look like.
Needless to say, the Journal’s report sparked a wide variety of reactions; the Danish government immediately said “no,” while one New York City tabloid laughed, even as other organs of the mainstream media heaped on their own ridicule. Not surprisingly, one MSNBC talking head went beyond attacking Trump to attack Trump supporters, chortling, “Can anybody at the MAGA rally point out Greenland on a map?”
In response, Trump kept the door open, telling reporters on August 18:
Strategically, it’s interesting, and we’d be interested, but we’ll talk to them a little bit. It’s not number one on the burner.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow added:
We’re looking at it …</span> Greenland is a strategic place. They’ve got a lot of valuable minerals … the president, who knows a thing or two about buying real estate, wants to take a look.
A few others were supportive; Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) tweeted on August 15:
This a smart geopolitical move. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The United States has a compelling strategic interest in Greenland, and this should absolutely be on the table.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Indeed, America’s strategic interest in Greenland has long been recognized.</span> As Foreign Policy magazine noted, the U.S. has tried, twice, to buy Greenland — once after the Civil War and again after World War Two. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">(During WWII, Uncle Sam used Greenland for military basing and supply; to this day, there’s a major Air Force base at Thule, less <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 1,000 miles</span> from the North Pole.)
</span>In fact, <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1917,</span> America purchased the Danish West Indies from Denmark; we <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">paid $25 million</span>, renaming them the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Indeed, in its history, the U.S. has bought plenty of land, including the Louisiana Territory from the French <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1803 and</span> Alaska from the Russians <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1867.</span> In each case, the pittance Uncle Sam spent was repaid a thousand-fold, not just because of the natural resources involved, nor just because expansive land helped Americans spread out and own their own property, but also because, by taking possession of that territory, we kept a hostile power from possessing it. (We can pause to consider how much more difficult America’s existence would have been, for example, if Napoleon had controlled the Mississippi River, or if the Russians had enjoyed a foothold in North America.)
So now, Greenland is a possible new frontier. The Danes have controlled it for centuries, and frankly, they haven’t done much with it. One reason, of course, is that it’s frigid and, indeed, mostly covered in glacier ice. And yet with the right mindset, inclement weather is only an obstacle, not a roadblock. As plucky Americans have proven in Alaska and elsewhere, we’re perfectly capable of dealing with harsh weather; after all, ice, cold, and isolation are irresistible to hardy vacationers and those who simply wish to really get away from it all.
Moreover, if profit beckons, miners and drillers can always punch their way through. And how much profit is to be had? The truth is, we really don’t know how much natural wealth is to be found in Greenland because nobody has ever seriously looked.
So why haven’t they looked? It’s because the Danes have chosen to treat the territory, for the most part, like a giant nature preserve. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">And that’s why the native population of Greenland mostly lives in relative poverty as poor dependents of the masters in Copenhagen.</span> Yes, it’s an odd kind of neocolonialism there in the North Atlantic as the politically correct Danes pat themselves on the back for their “enlightened eco-consciousness,” even as Greenlanders stay poor.
Yet even from afar, we know that Greenland offers a fantastic development opportunity. And so, if the Danes are too green and politically correct to extract that wealth, perhaps the U.S. can blaze a rich new trail.
Of course, some will say that all this is a pipe-dream, even if the U.S. were to become sovereign in Greenland. That is, the greens in America would work just as hard as the greens in Denmark to stop any such development, preferring to leave Greenland as it is, undeveloped. Yes, American greens, backed up by numerous billion-dollar foundations, would do precisely that: They’d organize, agitate, and litigate to leave Greenland to the seals and polar bears.
So we can see: Green power is not to be underestimated. As a matter of fact, the greens are so powerful in the U.S. that they have, in much of the country, taken the issue of natural resource development off the table. That’s why, for example, efforts to fully exploit America’s hydrocarbon resources have been stymied. As has been pointed out by Breitbart News, the total value of oil and natural gas, under federal lands and waters, <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is $128 trillion</span>. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">That’s a lot of wealth — six times America’s annual GDP, six times our national debt — and yet green power is such that few even talk about tapping into our natural abundance.
</span>So if Greenland were on the agenda, we could at least ask: What’s the value of underground resources in Greenland? And the answer is, simply, nobody knows. And yet we should be confident that the number is, well, yuge.
There’s a good reason — a cosmic reason, one might say — why we should be confident that there are plenty of resources to be found in Greenland. And that’s because valuable elements, and the resulting compounds and minerals, have been scattered all over the earth by the same gargantuan forces that created the universe in the first place. That is, all the naturally occurring elements in the periodic table — from copper to iron, from silver to gold — were created by nucleosynthesis, either as the result of the Big Bang eons ago or by subsequent stellar activity. All that nucleosynthesis has had the effect of hurling gases and matter around the universe until some of it was accreted into celestial bodies, such as our sun and its planets — and including our earth.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">So that’s why raw resources are both so abundant and so widely distributed here on this third rock from the sun; as Charlton Heston might have thundered at his Ten Commandments best, we can behold the mighty hands of God that have whipped treasures all around the globe, including in Greenland.
</span>Now here’s where human mind-power comes into the equation. All through human history, smart and hard-working people have unlocked value from seemingly barren patches of land; that is, they have learned to find, refine, and otherwise gain the riches of the earth. That was the story, for example, of Texas and Oklahoma, a century or more ago: tumbleweeds turned into oil rigs.
Indeed, ever since, the smart and the hard-working have found yet more ways to find additional oil and other hydrocarbons. In doing so, they have the defied most “experts.” You see, back in the early 1970s, savants opined that the world was in the midst of an “energy crisis,” and so we had to cut back on everything and live with less.
Yet in the decades since, in defiance of those brainiacs, we have proven that there was no such natural energy crisis. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The biggest problem was the unnatural imposition of U.S. price controls, finally lifted by President Ronald Reagan <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1981.</span></span> After Reagan de-controlled oil, its production surged. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Indeed, it surged so much that prices actually fell.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">In other words, the free market delivered an unabashed win-win: more production and lower prices.
</span>In the meantime, a whole new group of entrepreneurs and innovators came along, finding new ways to squeeze oil out of old fields; one such was George P. Mitchell (1919-2013), the Texas-born pioneer of fracking. As a result, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1980,</span> proven oil reserves in the U.S. have risen by more than a third, and around the world, reserves have nearly tripled.
So now, looking to the future, there’s every reason to believe that the same sequence would happen in Greenland: new thinking + new production = new wealth.
Of course, the greens would oppose all of this. They would say that they are worried about the puffins, of course, and they would also say they’re worried about climate change. That is, if we extracted and burned more carbon-based fuels, more carbon dioxide would enter into the atmosphere.
Yet seen through the proper prism of informed imagination, Greenland offers great hope for addressing that issue as well. That is, if the concern is that too much carbon dioxide is entering the atmosphere, there’s a simple enough thing to do: capture it. After all, if it was put into the atmosphere, it can be pulled out.
So how, exactly, to pull out the CO2? That can be done in lots of ways, including direct-air capture, as advocated by Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY). And there’s the related, perhaps simpler, idea of planting a lot of trees — call that organic carbon capture.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">As this author has argued here at Breitbart News, carbon capture by any means — industrial or biological — would be a powerful engine of rural economic development.
</span>So now we come back to Greenland. As noted, Greenland is more than a quarter the size of the <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Lower 48.</span> So that gives us plenty of vacant land to work with — to dig, to drill, to otherwise enjoy — and then, at the same time, the land can be used for carbon capture. Yes, it’s mostly ice, and yet useful things can be built on top of ice. And carbon could be the key ingredient.
After all, thanks to its marvelous bonding properties, carbon is the building block of just about everything, and so if we use our brains, we can figure out how to solidify carbon to make new structures — applying, for instance, 3-D printing to the construction of homes, towns, even whole cities. Heck, if we wanted to, we could make a carbon-nanotube space elevator; now that would be the world’s coolest carbon sink.
And if we need energy in Greenland, and we don’t find it in carbon fuels, we would have plenty of other options — if we keep our minds open. For instance, one visionary has suggested creating energy from moving weights around to power generators, and those weights could even be made of ice. (And if the ice melts, carbon capture might help restore the ice.)
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">By this reckoning, Greenland could be just the beginning of a whole new worldwide economic boom.</span> If we can develop that icy island, then there’s the rest of the Arctic, and also the Antarctic. And come to think of it, closer to home, there’s all the un-utilized land in the U.S.; the federal government <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">owns 28 percent</span> of all our territory. We need never touch the Grand Canyon or other precious parks; instead, we can start with <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 61 percent</span> of Alaska that the feds are sitting on.
So let’s give Trump credit for his Greenland idea. Even if nothing comes of it during his presidency, he has expanded the “Overton Window” — that is, the range of acceptable political discourse — reminding us that greatness comes from expansion and innovation, not from contraction and enervation.
One fine day, development will come to Greenland, as well as to other desolate places. Such development can, and should, be done cleanly as well as profitably.
There may never be a Trump Tower in Greenland. But even so, the MAGA spirit could be extended to include the new phrase, MGGA — Make Greenland Great Again.

611132b18e9901b4cf5d24a6,23219,"<h3>Assange's Arrest Was Possible Because Ecuador Abandoned Socialism</h3>The shocking news Thursday morning that the government of Ecuador invited British police into its embassy in London to arrest Wikileaks founder Julian Assange left many questioning why the Latin American country, which protected Assange for over half a decade, now felt comfortable letting him go.
The move by President Lenin Moreno – a socialist in name only who has used his tenure in office to liberalize the country after a decade of socialist rule – is the latest salvo in his ongoing campaign to erase the legacy of predecessor Rafael Correa.
Moreno is a member of Correa’s socialist party and became president after the latter threatened to dismantle the entire government if Ecuadorians did not elect his hand-picked successor. Yet he has all but eviscerated the relationship Correa cultivated with Marxist dictators in Venezuela and Cuba, demanded a revision of the country’s ties to communist China, and led a probe into Correa’s tenure that culminated in an arrest warrant for the former head of state.
This week, Moreno cut yet another Correa-era alliance, this time with a controversial antagonist whose only use to Correa was to annoy the U.S. government and help him cover up for authoritarian acts against Ecuadorian journalists.
“Ecuador is a generous country and a nation with open arms. Ours is a government respectful of the principles of international law, and of the institution of the right of asylum,” Moreno stated in a video message distributed on social media explaining the reasoning behind allowing Assange’s arrest. “Granting or withdrawing asylum is a sovereign right of the Ecuadorian state, according to international law.”
Moreno called Assange “disrespectful and aggressive” and accused him of “threatening declarations against Ecuador.” Beyond Assange’s personal behavior, however, Moreno argued that keeping him protected at the embassy violated international law.
“Ecuador’s patience with the behavior of Mr. Assange has reached its limit,” he concluded.

Correa</span></span> was among the first on Twitter to condemn Moreno, writing from exile in Belgium.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">“Lenin Moreno, the nefarious president of Ecuador, has demonstrated his poverty of humanity to the world, handing over Julian Assange – not just a refugee, but also an Ecuadorian citizen – to British police,” Correa wrote.</span> “This risks Assange’s life and humiliates Ecuador. Day of national mourning.”
Correa does not mention that Moreno’s government, not his, extended the courtesy of citizenship to Assange.
Lenín Moreno, nefasto presidente del Ecuador, ha demostrado su miseria humana al mundo, entregando a Julián Assange -no solo asilado, sino también ciudadano ecuatoriano- a la policía británica.
Esto pone en riesgo la vida de Assange, y humilla al Ecuador.

Correa</span></span> went on to call Moreno “the biggest traitor in Ecuadorian and Latin American history” in a barrage of Twitter posts. At press time, Correa has insulted Moreno on <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Twitter 12 times</span>, not counting retweets of others’ insults.
Reports and rumors that Moreno sought to evict Assange have circulated repeatedly in the past year, reaching a fever pitch when Assange attempted to file a lawsuit against the Ecuadorian government in October for “violating fundamental rights and freedoms” while he stayed at the embassy. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Assange was particularly offended by Ecuador’s demand he pay his internet bill if he wished to use the service, though reports also listed among Ecuador’s requests matters less clearly related to “fundamental rights and freedoms” such as Assange’s refusal to clean up after his cat.</span> The Ecuadorian courts dismissed the suit.
The Ecuadorian government’s issues with Assange aside, his status as a Correa-era bargaining chip proved of little value to Moreno. When Assange took refuge in the embassy <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> socialism was ascendant in South America and then-Ecuadorian President Correa had allied himself with the region’s worst leftist dictators: Cuba’s Fidel Castro and Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez. Correa had just begun emulating the Chávez tactic of shutting down opposition media networks when Assange’s legal situation made state protection – from any state – a must. Correa took the opportunity to lend Assange a hand, claiming to protect the right to a free press and a win against perennial Latin American leftist bogeyman “imperialism” in the process.
“They don’t realize Latin America is free and sovereign. We won’t tolerate interference, colonialism of any kind,” Correa said of the British at the time.
That language, which often featured anti-American tropes, defined the Correa era, as it did that of many leaders in the region at the time: Chávez, Castro regime henchmen, Bolivia’s Evo Morales, Peru’s Ollanta Humala, Argentina’s Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, among others. When right-wing challengers arose to replace many of these leaders later in the decade, many assumed Correa’s socialist movement to be among the few survivors of the continent’s rejection of socialism because of Lenin’s victory. Correa had supported Lenin vocally, at one point telling voters that, should they vote for his conservative rival, Correa would use an obscure procedural rule to dismantle the government and force another election over and over until voters got it “right.”
It took little time for Moreno to use his presidential powers to shift Ecuador rightward. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Under Moreno, Ecuador reversed policies to silence critics in the media and liberalized the economy.</span> It stopped pouring funds into Telesur, a far-left propaganda network largely controlled by Venezuela and Cuba. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">It has begun reevaluating oil deals with China that may have cost the Latin American country millions, presumably in exchange for political support on the global stage.</span> Those deals resulted in Ecuadorian courts first subpoenaing Correa to testify, then ordering his arrest. Moreno’s government has also enacted presidential term limits to block Correa for running for office again.
Most spectacularly, Moreno cut ties to Correa’s closest foreign ally, Venezuela. In an acrimonious declaration in August, Ecuador’s Foreign Ministry cut ties with the Maduro regime, resulting in an exchange of words with the Venezuelan Foreign Minister in which the latter referred to Moreno as a “liar” and a puppet of the United Nations. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Ecuador’s government issued a formal response calling the minister an “embarrassment” and a “poor excuse for a human being,” and his government “sinister.”
Tensions between Moreno and Latin America’s leftists, who once considered him one of their own, will likely continue to worsen as the Venezuelan political crisis continues, bringing the economies of its allies like Cuba down with it.</span> With Assange’s arrest, Moreno has signaled to those powers that he has no intention of returning to their circle.

611132b18e9901b4cf5d24a6,49697,"<h3>Skiing Kosovo, Abandoned Lifts and All</h3>The flakes stumbled into the windows, gathered themselves and then wobbled on like revelers caught between pubs. At times it snowed so hard I could hardly see anything out there at all. A wood hut. A concrete wall. When the storm finally broke three days later, <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">some 40 inches</span> of snow had fallen and everything sprang to life.
The timing was ideal. A few hours earlier, I had arrived in Pristina, the red-roofed capital of Kosovo, just as the first flakes corkscrewed their way to earth. It was February, frigid, and a worsted wool blanket stretched across the Balkan sky. I threw my skis into the back of a 4Runner with two Serbs I had hired to pick me up, and we rode south in silence toward the Sharr Mountains along the Macedonian border. In an hour we’d be at Brezovica, the most delightfully dysfunctional ski resort in Europe.
You’ve probably heard of Kosovo but not of skiing in Kosovo. Landlocked between Albania and Serbia, Kosovo was the last of the nations to congeal in the caldron of old Yugoslavia. For years it remained a largely autonomous province tucked in southwestern Serbia, but a full-blown war for independence erupted there <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1998 between</span> Orthodox Serbs and ethnic Albanians, who are Muslims. The fighting grew so ugly with a Serb-sponsored campaign of ethnic cleansing that NATO eventually intervened on the Albanians’ behalf <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1999.</span> Today, to the United States and <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 110 other</span> countries that recognize it, Kosovo stands as Europe’s newest country, an eight-year-old diamond of roughly two million friendly, westward-looking people still struggling to get on their feet.
But before all of that there was skiing, and Yugoslavia had plenty of it, from Kranjska Gora in the north to Papova Shapka in the south. The sport soared in popularity when the Olympics came to Bosnia <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1984 and</span> a Slovenian, Jure Franko, won silver in the giant slalom to clinch Yugoslavia’s first Winter Olympic medal ever. Brezovica, <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 250 miles</span> southeast of Sarajevo, served as a backup for those games, but Yugoslavia’s more hard-bitten skiers already knew the place for offering the steepest slopes and deepest powder for the fewest dinars.
There near the Serbian enclave of Strpce <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 35 miles</span> south of Pristina, storms slam into <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 8,000</span>-foot Sharr Mountains that rocket out of the Metohija basin with abrupt ridges and mighty shoulders cupping some of the continent’s most extensive pasturelands. Back in the ’80s, the resort’s hey-decade,<span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 10 lifts</span>, including five surface tows, serviced nine named runs, though the real magic happened in the go-anywhere terrain of the open north-facing bowls. D.J.s from Belgrade and Skopje kept the parties going until dawn. In the morning you might awake to find so much snow had fallen that even the wild chamois were stuck.
Brezovica survived the wars but not the peace that followed. Throughout the early 2000s, INEX, the Serbian socially owned enterprise that managed the resort, stopped investing in Brezovica and everything began to crumble. One of the main hotels, a graceless rectangular prism, became a drafty concrete husk. The disco floor went cold. One by one the lifts failed, and <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2013 none</span> of them worked. The storied resort was all but dead.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Then last April, a French consortium signed a contract with Kosovo’s Trade and Industry Ministry to bring Brezovica back to life; the plan was so ambitious that many locals weren’t sure if it was true.</span> A group of some of the world’s biggest leisure resort development firms — MDP Consulting, the engineering firm Egis and the Compagnie des Alpes, the world’s largest ski area management company behind French ski resorts like Val d’Isère, Tignes and Méribel — agreed to invest half a billion dollars, <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 410 million</span> euros, over the <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">next 17 years</span> to make Brezovica one of the largest, if not the largest, mountain resorts in the Balkans. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">According to Jill Jamieson, a consultant who has worked on the finance package, that is the single largest private investment in the country since the war, if not ever.
</span>The scope of the proposal is mind-boggling. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">The consortium has until May to put the financing in order, meaning work could begin this summer.</span> When complete, the resort, <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 8,000 acres</span>, will be the size of one and a half Vails, nearly all of which is skiable and inside a national park. It will have the vertical drop of a Crested Butte, <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 2,600 feet</span>. The number of hotel beds will grow <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 700 to</span><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7,000 </span>— three times as many currently available across the entire country. Visitors will <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">have 100 miles</span> of slopes, high-speed lifts and three gondola-linked villages. Two international airports, Pristina and Skopje, are no more than a 90-minute drive. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">One day Brezovica might even provide a more budget-friendly alternative to skiing in the Alps.
</span>Skeptics abound, of course. Can the next greatest place to ski in Europe really be in a tiny war-weary country so obscure it’s hard to imagine anyone vacationing there at all? Is a mega-resort the most sustainable way to attract tourists? Will they even find enough snow on a warming planet? Never mind Kosovo’s rampant corruption and politics that are so cantankerous that politicians themselves have lobbed tear gas canisters in their own chambers at least six times in the last few months to disrupt their own proceedings.
And yet there is hope.
“If we can do this, we can do anything,” said Manik Begolli, an Albanian Kosovar who worked on a public-private partnership team contracted by the United States Agency for International Development to help find an investor.
Maybe. For the moment, though, I just hoped I could ski.
Seven-Elevens have bigger parking lots than Brezovica’s but that’s where the Serbs dropped me off just after dark as the storm gathered intensity. Igor Nikolcevic met me there in a camouflage snowboard jacket. He <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 42,</span> a Serb with closely cropped hair and soulful eyes. He grabbed my ski bag and led me up an icy path to a pizzeria that he started with his wife, Draginja, and which he named after his daughter, Tina. Tina now lives in Pristina. I could have her room, fuzzy kitten posters and all.
I followed Igor into the heart of the village, a collection of mostly hand-built cottages run by hangers-on who have eked out a living by offering basic services to the few who make it this far. There was the Cafe Braca and Restaurant Ljuboten. Skis lined the racks in a shop called Dane. The main chairlift out of the village, an ancient double chair, stood eerily quiet, the seats glazed in ice.
“What time will the lifts start running?” I asked.
“You mean, if they start running,” Igor replied.
That was actually an improvement over the last time I was here, <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013,</span> when INEX was hundreds of thousands of euros behind on its power bill and the utility company had cut electricity to the lifts. All was not lost. Instead, for €7 — <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $9 at</span> the time — the Dane guys would give you a ride to the top in a snow-grooming machine, where an entire resort’s worth of untracked powder tugged at my tips.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">It was some of the best skiing I’d ever had for less than a nickel a turn: an unlimited supply of deep, creamy snow on a steep, consistent fall line.</span> Others just hiked up a small rise with sleds or sipped brandy outside while music pumped from competing loudspeakers. I loved the vibe and vowed to return.
This time, two years later, there was at least the possibility that the lifts might run. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Sometime <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2014,</span></span> as the French were quietly studying the resort’s prospects, a cadre of groups, including the Kosovo Electricity Corporation, local officials and the minister of trade and industry, hashed out a deal to get two of the chairlifts spinning again.</span> The equipment was still old, maybe even from the 1970s, and too unsafe to operate in a blizzard. I would have to wait for fairer skies to ride them.
Igor pushed open a door and the pizzeria sighed a breath of warm air. Christmas lights hung from the log cabin frame and spilled a molten glow on the snow outside. Snowshoes, wooden skis and photographs of wintry scenes from the resort’s early days decorated the walls. A fire crackled in the wood stove. A pizzeria in Kosovo is one of the coziest places I know.
I took a seat at a long wooden table next to a local with an even longer face. His house two doors down had just succumbed to a chimney fire. With no firefighters to navigate the winding, snowy road up from Strpce in time, the men of the village had rallied to form a bucket brigade and fell a flame-licked tree. That saved the village but the house, a lovely wood and stone cottage, was a loss.
“It went up like paper,” said the owner, Andrej Kavcic. He poured two shots of slivovitz, the plum brandy, and handed me one. “What am I going to do?” he asked. “You pick yourself up and move on. What else.”
Stoicism seems to be a national trait in Kosovo, but there is no mistaking that the country is picking itself up. <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Some 80 percent</span> of the population was displaced during the war. Now new furniture stores sit along new highways lined with new gas stations. The Pristina airport underwent a €180 million expansion <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2013 and</span> is now the third-busiest airport in the old Yugoslavia after Belgrade and Zagreb. Problems persist, but the country is making strides to protect its landscape, integrate into Europe and normalize relations with Belgrade, the reason behind parliament’s self-tear-gassing attacks.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">The resort’s rebirth comes at a time when Kosovo could really use jobs.</span> Drive around the country and you’ll see smartly dressed people in cafes, in parks, in front of stores, anywhere but at work. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The resort could provide as many <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 3,000 jobs</span>, some temporary, many permanent, in a country where half the population is <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 30 and</span><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 58 percent</span> of the work force is “inactive.”
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">But more than that, travel insiders around the Balkans have long yearned to trade the region’s oily image of strife for that of the crisp fabric of an emerging adventure-travel destination.</span> The efforts appear to be working. <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2014,</span></span><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.7 million</span> international tourists visited Albania, up from <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 645,000 in</span><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2004.</span> And in Montenegro, you can sea kayak through the watercress on Skadar Lake or catch feisty trout in green Macedonian streams, both with guides.
Few Balkan countries beyond Croatia and Greece can entice transoceanic travelers as stand-alone destinations at the moment but, collectively, places like Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania can make for a wildly fascinating itinerary. Kosovo wants in on that action. Brezovica may be its best shot.
“Kosovo is absolutely ready for something like this,” said Pascal Roux, the chief executive of MDP Consulting and leader of the French consortium. “Brezovica could be the pearl of the Balkans.”
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Maybe so, but “it’s just hugely important to be sure it’s done right,” said Christopher Doyle, executive director for Europe of the Adventure Travel Trade Association, which champions sustainable adventure travel markets.</span> What is needed, he said, are “thoughtful supporting efforts to engage the local community and protect the environment.”
Across the Balkans, there is little doubt that skiing is having a moment. Ecosign, a Canadian mountain resort planning firm that has designed Alpine skiing venues for five Winter Olympics, has <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">completed 15 master</span> plans for new or drastically reorganized resorts, including three in Macedonia, four in Serbia and two in Greece. A Dubai-based firm in December announced plans to build <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $5 billion</span> “tourist city” with thousands of holiday homes near Bosnia’s Bjelasnica mountain, where the Olympics were held. Kopaonik, Serbia’s most developed ski resort, added a new six-person heated chairlift last year and a new hotel. Poiana Brasov in Romania recently spent €30 million expanding its terrain, adding snow-making and upgrading lifts.
If anyone stands to lose on the Brezovica deal, it’s Igor. His grandfather, Radojko Nikolcevic, was the ski area’s first general manager after the resort opened <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1954.</span> In the ’70s he built a hut that would become Tina’s pizzeria under Igor <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1993.</span> Today the Nikolcevices earn enough money selling pizzas in winter to last them the rest of the year. Now the consortium will level almost everything — the hotels, the village, the lifts. The Nikolcevices will get <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $250,000 in</span> expropriation fees, but money isn’t the issue.
“We’re happy people want to invest in the resort but never in my life have I been as afraid for my future as I am right now,” Igor said. “The mountains are in me.”
Over the next three days a frustrating pattern emerged. Each morning I awoke to another foot of snow, and each morning the lifts weren’t running. The Dane guys weren’t offering the seven-euro special. Hiking up alone would be misery. Still, I hoped for the best.
I lounged around Tina’s watching the snowflakes hit the windows or took naps under a shaggy blanket in Tina’s old room. The Nikolcevices treated me like family. We sat near the fire talking about life in Kosovo. On the war: “Stupid politicians caused it.” On being Serbs surrounded by Albanians: “We never have an argument.” On why I should not clear the table: “This is Balkans,” Draginja said. “Women do this.”
I helped anyway and then serviced my macho deficits by grabbing a shovel to clear snow off the pizzeria’s roof. The electricity flickered on and off.
“There is something beautiful when everything is broken,” Draginja told me later over a meal of tangy mountain cheese, winter cabbage and a Serbian dish of shredded pork called duvan cvarci. “Everyone comes together.”
On the fourth day, the storm thinned into a delicate fog, and, miracle of miracles, the lifts creaked to life. At last I could ski.
I raced out the door. Classic rock blared from the Che & Fox cafe. Vendors jammed folding tables into the snow to peddle Serbian beer, Austrian juices and Lucky Strikes. A man in the parking lot sat next to a delivery truck with a cardboard sign: ski rentals €5. I clicked into my own skis and scooted up to a double chair called Livada, or “meadow” in Serbian. It rose lazily over an abandoned stone mansion called Stojko’s house, one of the few buildings that will remain. A man stood next to the entrance ready to check my lift ticket. I didn’t have one. I asked where to buy it.
“No, no, you don’t need a ticket,” said a voice in English behind me. I turned to see two men on skis. One of them in a red jacket shuffled forward, said something in Serbian and pressed <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3 worth</span> of coins into the attendant’s palm. “Come, come,” my new friend said, and off we went.
Rexhep Krasniqi,<span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 58,</span> had fled <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Kosovo 23 years</span> ago as a refugee and now worked as a contractor in London. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">He had returned to ski with his younger brother, Isak, who had run a refugee camp in Macedonia before landing a job in finance.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Isak was now unemployed but not worried.</span> “We are good at surviving,” he said.
I spent most of the day skiing with the Krasniqis, who explained the ticket system. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">A price list said I could buy anything from a single ride <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 10 days</span> of unlimited rides, but almost no one consulted it.</span> Instead they negotiated rates with the attendant. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">A single ride cost <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $3.25,</span> though Rexhep had bargained to get both of us at least two rides for that.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">As best as I could tell a day pass cost <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $11.</span>
Now, new for this winter, workers have installed an electronic ticket-reader and day passes have jumped to <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $21,</span> a fortune when the average worker earns <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $380 a</span> month.</span> “No more corruption,” a local told me later, “but less skiers.”
We picked our way through a steep notch called the Lion’s Gate and found untracked lines through the trees. Wind-powered snow roared off the ridge behind us in great white flames. The snow hissed violently off the bottoms of my skis to form blue contrails. Most of the terrain was intermediate to expert-only. The revamped resort will have more beginner runs.
Eventually we stopped for lunch on a patio at a slopeside hut called Cafe Collmar, where a waiter brought us coffee, brandy and cheesy bread. Rexhep refused to let me pay <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $5 bill</span>. “No Albanian in Kosovo will ever let you pay,” he said, politely but firmly. “You are American, and to us Americans are like Jesuses.”
My last day dawned a piercing blue and the air shimmered with suspended snow crystals. This time Igor and a friend from Belgrade, Marko Nikolic, showed me a wild backcountry run that dropped through miles of open powder into a tight stream bed. Marko, a mountain guide, then invited me to climb to a high point in the resort,<span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,274</span>-foot Pribreg mountain, where we could find the longest, most challenging runs back to the base.
We rode Livada up as high as it went, then I slung my skis over my shoulder and kicked steps up the sastrugi beyond the top station. We gained an easy ridge and made the summit <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 45 minutes</span>. A lift once came all the way up here but it hadn’t worked in years, and the top wheelhouse was completely entombed in tons of feathered ice. The slope below was so steep it gave me vertigo.
Soon all of this would be very different. I tried to picture a brand-new lift stitched into the rock, the sprawling village where Tina’s once stood, and the legs I’d need to ski all those new runs. I had one foot in Macedonia, the other in Kosovo, and five more countries in view.
It may have been selfish, but Brezovica felt perfect as is. We have so many polished resorts already but so few that can foster skiing at its most authentic without any flash. Even more selfish: What do you do when you know one of your favorite places to visit, a secret, is about to blow up? Don’t you long for it to stay the way it is?
Brezovica has to change, of course. As anyone in Kosovo knows, stop moving for long enough and someone will come bury you.
Marko wasted no time. He strapped on his snowboard. I lowered my goggles. Then we both pushed off and floated through a beautiful, broken world.
IF YOU GO
Getting There
Pristina (PRN) and Skopje (SKP) are the closest airports to Brezovica. There are no direct flights to either city from the United States. Check fares on Turkish Airlines, Swiss, Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, SAS, EasyJet, Delta, Alitalia and Norwegian for connecting in Europe.
What You Should Know
This winter will likely be the last to see Brezovica in all of its rundown glory. In its current state, the resort is not for everyone. The lifts may not run every day. There is no such thing as customer service. It’s unclear what facilities will be open next winter. For updates check the Sar Planina-Brezovica Facebook page or the Brezovica Resort Facebook page. The ski area also has a website but it isn’t very helpful: brezovica-ski.com.
Guides
Hiring a guide to help you find a place to stay and arrange airport transfers is a must at the moment. Igor Nikolcevic is neither a guide nor an outfitter but he speaks very good English and can help arrange transfers, especially from Pristina, lift tickets, guides and lodging. Message him through the Pizzeria Tina Facebook page. Outdoor Albania, an outfitter based in Tirana, also runs custom trips to Brezovica. (OutdoorAlbania.com; info@outdooralbania.com).
Transfers and Lift Tickets
Expect to pay <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 50 euros</span> each way for transfers from Pristina. <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Lift tickets now cost €20 a day.</span>",,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,4,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,

DealBook Briefing: Does Facebook Have Room for More Than One Founder?
Good Thursday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)
Founders may think twice about selling to Facebook
Selling your start-up to Facebook will make you rich, but it might not make you happy. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, who sold Instagram to the social networking giant for <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $715 million</span>, resigned earlier this week, reportedly over tensions with Mark Zuckerberg about growth.
Brian Acton, one of the co-founders who sold WhatsApp to Facebook <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $22 billion</span>, went further. In a dishy interview with Forbes, he spoke of similar tensions with Mr. Zuckerberg. (Facebook wanted ads; he didn’t.)
“They are businesspeople, they are good businesspeople,” Mr. Acton said. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">“They just represent a set of business practices, principles and ethics, and policies that I don’t necessarily agree with.”
</span>A senior Facebook executive, David Marcus, pushed back against Mr. Acton, writing in a post that “attacking the people and company that made you a billionaire” is “a whole new standard of low-class.”
Yes, founders take their money and make a choice. But Facebook’s acquisition strategy appears to be stuttering, and its newer products may head in unexpected directions with their founders out of the picture. <span id=""1"" class=""red"">That’s a problem: Facebook’s acquisitions have been oases of calm and growth compared to its main business.
</span>SoftBank’s founder has the biggest dreams in tech
Masa Son has raised <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly $100 billion</span> for his company’s Vision Fund to invest in tech companies, on what he says is a 300-year strategy. But in a Bloomberg Businessweek profile, he says that’s only the start: He wants to raise <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another $100 billion</span> every two or three years, and expand the Vision Fund’s team of deal makers <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 300.</span> Counting him, it’s currently ten.
That’s an incredible amount of money, and competing investment firms are (understandably) frightened. It’s very different at start-ups, Businessweek points out:
SoftBank has given them the equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet of foreign investment dollars. “You think they can’t eat any more,” says Jules Maltz, a partner with IVP, a Sand Hill Road firm. The entrepreneurs “cram it in, put it in their pockets, take doggy bags, whatever.”
The bigger worry might be to SoftBank’s investors: The Vision Fund will need a lot of home-run investments to cover bets that huge.
Silicon Valley tells lawmakers to go easy on regulation
Executives from Google, Apple, AT&T and more appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee yesterday to answer privacy questions. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">“We have arrived at a moment where, I believe, there is a strong desire by both Republicans and Democrats, and by both industry and public interest groups, to work in good faith to reach a consensus on a national consumer data privacy law,” Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the committee’s chairman, said in an opening statement.
</span>But a clear message emerged from the tech giants: Don’t go too far.
• Amazon’s associate general counsel, Andrew DeVore, asked lawmakers to “ensure that additional overhead and administration demands any legislation might require actually produce commensurate privacy benefits.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">• Keith Enright, Google’s new chief privacy officer, told them to “take into consideration the impacts on service functionality, the consumer benefits of free and low-cost products, the future of the open web and app ecosystem.”
</span>Nothing will happen quickly. “I think we might have a pretty good idea what a draft would look like,” Mr. Thune concluded. “But I suspect we probably wouldn’t get it acted on until next year.”

Coming up today
The Senate Judiciary Committee will hear from Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford. Dr. Blasey, who accused the Supreme Court nominee of sexual assault, will testify first, starting <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 10 a</span>.m. Eastern. Judge Kavanaugh is also expected to be questioned about accusations from other women, including one who came forward yesterday.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Steven Mnuchin might talk trade.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The Treasury secretary, who has kept a low profile recently, is scheduled to speak at a Washington event sponsored by The Hill.
</span>The Commerce Department will release second-quarter G.D.P. data. Analysts expect <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 4.2 percent</span> annualized growth rate.
The Census Bureau will publish durable goods order numbers for August. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">They are forecast to have risen <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 1.2 percent</span>, having <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fallen 1.7 percent</span> in July because of shrinking demand for transportation equipment.
</span>Fox admits defeat over Sky
Twenty-First Century Fox agreed yesterday to sell <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 39 percent</span> stake in the British broadcaster to Comcast <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $15 billion</span>. It’s the end of a monthslong battle, and of a yearslong quest by Rupert Murdoch to regain control of a company he created decades ago.
Fox is selling at the behest of Walt Disney, which struck a deal over the summer to buy most of Mr. Murdoch’s media empire.
Elizabeth Winkler of Heard on the Street says it’<span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $15 billion</span> for Disney to spend on its fight with Netflix. But for Comcast shareholders, it’s <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">another $15 billion</span> spent on an asset that many didn’t want in the first place.
<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Fed stands up to Trump
It raised interest rates as expected yesterday, to <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2 and</span><span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.25 percent</span>, citing a “particularly bright moment” for the U.S. economy.</span> President Trump said he was “not happy.”
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">So he shows no sign of returning to the tradition of presidential silence on fiscal policy.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">But the Fed still plans another increase before the end of the year, and some of its officials reckon avoiding inflation will require raising rates to the point of restricting the economy.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">For his part, Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chief, said yesterday: “We don’t consider political factors.”
</span>For Nike, Kaepernick is an existential choice
The sportswear company’s decision to feature Colin Kaepernick in its latest ads has been celebrated as shrewd marketing. But Nike nearly dropped the former N.F.L. quarterback after he became the face of player protests.
Then its communications chief, Nigel Powell, intervened, report Julie Creswell, Kevin Draper and Sapna Maheshwari in the NYT:
Powell argued that Nike would face backlash from the media and consumers if it was seen as siding with the N.F.L. rather than Kaepernick. And Nike, along with most apparel companies, is desperate to attract urban youth who increasingly look up to Kaepernick; the largely white, older N.F.L. fans angry at the league over the protests are not a priority for those companies, analysts say.
Another factor: Under Nike’s latest deal with the N.F.L., it can’t sell league-branded merchandise <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">after 2020.</span> That helped it choose to put Mr. Kaepernick front and center. So far, the wager is paying off.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Could Treasuries end the bull market?
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">The stock market may face a new threat: increasingly attractive returns on government bonds.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">More from Peter Eavis of DealBook:
Buying a 10-year Treasury today would provide its holders <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 3 percent</span> a year for a decade with virtually no risk of losing any money in the process.</span> <span id=""14"" class=""red"">Such a return might seem particularly attractive to investors who believe the stock market is expensive and is vulnerable to a sell-off.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">And:
If companies’ profits continue to grow strongly, the earnings yield will rise and stocks will look more attractive compared with government bonds.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">But corporate earnings growth is expected to slow next year.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">And the trade war may cause corporate profits to moderate even more.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">In that case, the difference between the 10-year yield and the earnings yield would shrink even more.</span> Investors may be more tempted then to shed stocks and put more money into bonds.
