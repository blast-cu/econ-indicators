You never want to get too caught up in a single number.\u201d\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Gains from the tax cut are likely to be stronger in the second quarter as adjusted individual withholding

<span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">That was the fastest pace <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2011 and</span> it comes as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is

to tighten more aggressively this year and that will lay the seeds for an economic slowdown starting next year,\u201d economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics told clients.\n</span><span id=\"14\"

Yellen, had \u201creally made it clear that she\u2019d like to re-engage those sidelined in recent years by allowing the unemployment rate to fall below what most consider full employment.</span> It\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to regain living standards lost in recent years.\u201d\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The Fed faces an uphill battle, she and other analysts suggested, as the United States now appears to be importing some of the economic malaise that has infected other parts of the world, particularly China and Europe.\nMs. Swonk, who labeled the employment numbers a \u201cbody blow,\u201d warned that the economy was likely to be plagued by subpar growth for a while.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Industry has been hurt by the strong dollar and weak global demand; the oil industry has cut back sharply on investment in response to the fall in energy prices; and farming has suffered because of slumping agricultural commodity prices.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Last month, the sectors that absorbed the greatest job losses were mining, logging and manufacturing.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">By contrast, health care, leisure and hospitality, and professional and business services remained strong, highlighting other signs of sturdiness in the economy that countered the otherwise disheartening jobs news.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Consumer demand at home has been on the upswing and vehicle sales have been strong.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">And a broader measure of unemployment, which includes part-time workers who want full-time jobs and those too discouraged to even search, dipped <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 10 percent</span> in September, its lowest mark since <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 2008.</span>\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">\u201cAgainst the backdrop of accelerating real consumption, it\u2019s hard to see what\u2019s driving this softening and what could sustain it,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, sounding a more optimistic note.</span> \u201cWe have to expect better numbers next month, and the odds still strongly favor upward revisions, despite the unexpected downward revision to August.\u201d\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">But Mr. Shepherdson was drowned out by a chorus of more negative reactions to the estimate that employers created <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 142,000 jobs</span> in September.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Adding to the gloom, the Labor Department revised August\u2019s employment numbers, registering <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 136,000 new</span> jobs for that month, well below <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 173,000 originally</span> reported.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">With Friday\u2019s revision, job gains have averaged <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 167,000 a</span> month for the last three months, compared with an average of <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 260,000 for</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014.</span></span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Average hourly wages in the private sector dropped slightly, as did the average length of the workweek.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">With the presidential campaign already underway, neither party wasted much time in using the jobs report to attack the other side.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Republicans criticized the president for promoting a program that they argue stifles economic growth.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">The slowdown may provide a political opening for Republican contenders to attack Mr. Obama and the Democrats on an issue that was not resonating as much with voters when the job market was on the upswing.\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">In response, President Obama vowed on Friday not to sign another temporary spending measure after the one passed this week in an effort to raise the pressure on Congress to reach a long-term agreement to finance the government.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Speaking to reporters at the White House, Mr. Obama warned that the economy could be endangered by the continual game of budget chicken encouraged by conservative Republicans in hopes of forcing Democrats to give ground on other issues, like health care and the fate of Planned Parenthood.\n</span>The short-term spending bill passed this week to pay for government operations only until Dec.<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11,</span> he said, was a \u201cgimmick\u201d that \u201csets up another potential manufactured crisis just two weeks before Christmas.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is not the way the U.S. should be operating.\u201d\n<span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">To prevent a recurrence, he said he would veto any further budget measures postponing a full-fledged spending plan.</span> \u201cI will not sign another shortsighted spending bill like the one Congress sent me this week,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe purchased ourselves <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">another 10 weeks</span>. We need to use them.\u201d\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">While overall growth remains on a slow but steady track, the job outlook varies markedly depending on geography, training and industry.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Looking at the feeble rise in median wages, Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor Economic Research, pointed out that such figures masked a wide disparity among industries.</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Workers in financial services, construction and graphic design, for example, have on average enjoyed double-digit wage growth from the previous year.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Those stuck in neutral or suffering from effective wage declines included those in the manufacturing, retail clothing and textile industries.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">The demand for young, high-technology workers has been evident to Isaac Oates, the chief executive of Justworks, a human resources management company that handles mostly small businesses.</span> \u201cWe see that a lot of companies are growing quickly\u201d in this area, saying his own firm has grown <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 60 workers</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 40 over</span> the past three months in order to keep pace.\n<span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Other industries, like travel and leisure, have proved more resilient job creators, even if wages have not grown much.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">An improving housing market has also helped push down the number of unemployed workers with construction experience to its lowest level <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2000,</span> according to the Associated General Contractors of America.\n</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">The picture is bleaker for those in the low-skill corners of the economy.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019re still finding a lot of skilled jobs come open, but it\u2019s certainly slowed down for the unskilled,\u201d said Robert A. Funk, chairman and chief executive of Express Employment Professionals, a staffing agency based in Oklahoma City <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 750 offices</span>.\n</span>Skilled workers are at a premium at Advanced Technology Services, a manufacturing consulting company based in Peoria, Ill.\n\u201cWhere we\u2019re struggling is in the area of talented people in manufacturing,\u201d Jeff Owens, the company\u2019s president, said, mentioning that he would like to add <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 160 managers</span>, electricians, information technology workers and machinists to <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 3,300</span>-person staff.\nLocation also matters. Mr. Funk, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said he observed a slowing down in the last six weeks, with the biggest drop-offs in the oil-drilling states, including Texas, Oklahoma and North and South Dakota.\n<span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Others fear that the economy is never going to deliver many gains to workers who have been waiting years to receive any bounty from the upswing in business activity.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">William Spriggs, chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said: \u201cWe\u2019ve pretty much reached a kind of stability, and the unemployment rate will continue to fall, mostly because of retirements.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">An analysis this week from Morgan Stanley noted that the decline in the unemployment rate <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 5.1 percent</span> in August, <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 5.5 percent</span> in May, was almost entirely attributable to changes in the labor force participation rate.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">The percentage of the working-age population that is employed \u2014 which many economists consider a better indicator of the health of the job market than the official jobless figure \u2014 has stayed flat at <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">under 60 percent</span> for several years, still well below its prerecession level of <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 63.</span>\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">Public sector jobs were one of the few bright spots, growing <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 24,000 in</span> September, thanks to hiring on the state and local level.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">But government workers \u2014 from teachers to police officers to transit workers \u2014 have not made up

Rate Revisions a Sign of a Slowdown</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Unexpectedly dismal job growth last month cast a shadow on the nation\u2019s economy, as a government report on Friday sent analysts scrambling for adjectives like \u201cdreadful,\u201d \u201ca body blow\u201d and \u201cgrim\u201d to describe just how disappointing they found the latest employment figures.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Labor Department found that the jobless rate held steady <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 5.1 percent</span> in September, but wage gains stalled, the labor force shrank and employers created many fewer positions than they had been averaging in recent months.</span> <span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">While the latest report is only a snapshot of the economy and the weakness may ultimately prove fleeting, it made clear that ordinary workers are still failing to take home the kind of monetary rewards normally expected from a recovery that has being going on for more than six years.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The new estimates came just two weeks after the Federal Reserve decided that the economy\u2019s advance remained too fragile to risk lifting interest rates from their near-zero level \u2014 even as it hinted an increase would come before the year\u2019s end.</span> Now, experts said, signs of a slowdown may well push any rise <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">into 2016.</span>\n<span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The odds of a move in December have \u201cclearly diminished,\u201d said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago.</span> \u201cThere\u2019s nothing good in this morning\u2019s report.\u201d\n<span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">Despite the lagging economy, the mere likelihood that the Fed would yet again postpone a retreat on its stimulus program may have ultimately buoyed some investors\u2019 confidence.</span> <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">After opening sharply down after the Labor Department\u2019s announcement, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index turned around, ending the day up <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">over 1.4 percent</span>, <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 1,951.36.</span></span> <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond dipped <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">below 2 percent</span>.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">\u201cThat may assure the markets that unconditional support from monetary policy will be sustained,\u201d Mr. Tannenbaum said.</span> \u201cLow for long may go on even longer.\u201d\n<span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago, said the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, had \u201creally made it clear that she\u2019d like to re-engage those sidelined in recent years by allowing the unemployment rate to fall below what most consider full employment.</span> It\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to regain living standards lost in recent years.\u201d\n<span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The Fed faces an uphill battle, she and other analysts suggested, as the United States now appears to be importing some of the economic malaise that has infected other parts of the world, particularly China and Europe.\nMs. Swonk, who labeled the employment numbers a \u201cbody blow,\u201d warned that the economy was likely to be plagued by subpar growth for a while.\n</span><span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Industry has been hurt by the strong dollar and weak global demand; the oil industry has cut back sharply on investment in response to the fall in energy prices; and farming has suffered because of slumping agricultural commodity prices.</span> <span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Last month, the sectors that absorbed the greatest job losses were mining, logging and manufacturing.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">By contrast, health care, leisure and hospitality, and professional and business services remained strong, highlighting other signs of sturdiness in the economy that countered the otherwise disheartening jobs news.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">Consumer demand at home has been on the upswing and vehicle sales have been strong.</span> <span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">And a broader measure of unemployment, which includes part-time workers who want full-time jobs and those too discouraged to even search, dipped <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 10 percent</span> in September, its lowest mark since <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">May 2008.</span>\n</span><span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">\u201cAgainst the backdrop of accelerating real consumption, it\u2019s hard to see what\u2019s driving this softening and what could sustain it,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, sounding a more optimistic note.</span> \u201cWe have to expect better numbers next month, and the odds still strongly favor upward revisions, despite the unexpected downward revision to August.\u201d\n<span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">But Mr. Shepherdson was drowned out by a chorus of more negative reactions to the estimate that employers created <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 142,000 jobs</span> in September.</span> <span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Adding to the gloom, the Labor Department revised August\u2019s employment numbers, registering <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">only 136,000 new</span> jobs for that month, well below <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 173,000 originally</span> reported.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">With Friday\u2019s revision, job gains have averaged <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 167,000 a</span> month for the last three months, compared with an average of <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 260,000 for</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2014.</span></span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Average hourly wages in the private sector dropped slightly, as did the average length of the workweek.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">With the presidential campaign already underway, neither party wasted much time in using the jobs report to attack the other side.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Republicans criticized the president for promoting a program that they argue stifles economic growth.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">The slowdown may provide a political opening for Republican contenders to attack Mr. Obama and the Democrats on an issue that was not resonating as much with voters when the job market was on the upswing.\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">In response, President Obama vowed on Friday not to sign another temporary spending measure after the one passed this week in an effort to raise the pressure on Congress to reach a long-term agreement to finance the government.\n</span><span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Speaking to reporters at the White House, Mr. Obama warned that the economy could be endangered by the continual game of budget chicken encouraged by conservative Republicans in hopes of forcing Democrats to give ground on other issues, like health care and the fate of Planned Parenthood.\n</span>The short-term spending bill passed this week to pay for government operations only until Dec.<span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 11,</span> he said, was a \u201cgimmick\u201d that \u201csets up another potential manufactured crisis just two weeks before Christmas.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is not the way the U.S. should be operating.\u201d\n<span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">To prevent a recurrence, he said he would veto any further budget measures postponing a full-fledged spending plan.</span> \u201cI will not sign another shortsighted spending bill like the one Congress sent me this week,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe purchased ourselves <span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">another 10 weeks</span>. We need to use them.\u201d\n<span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">While overall growth remains on a slow but steady track, the job outlook varies markedly depending on geography, training and industry.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">Looking at the feeble rise in median wages, Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor Economic Research, pointed out that such figures masked a wide disparity among industries.</span> <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Workers in financial services, construction and graphic design, for example, have on average enjoyed double-digit wage growth from the previous year.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Those stuck in neutral or suffering from effective wage declines included those in the manufacturing, retail clothing and textile industries.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">The demand for young, high-technology workers has been evident to Isaac Oates, the chief executive of Justworks, a human resources management company that handles mostly small businesses.</span> \u201cWe see that a lot of companies are growing quickly\u201d in this area, saying his own firm has grown <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 60 workers</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 40 over</span> the past three months in order to keep pace.\n<span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Other industries, like travel and leisure, have proved more resilient job creators, even if wages have not grown much.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">An improving housing market has also helped push down the number of unemployed workers with construction experience to its lowest level <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2000,</span> according to the Associated General Contractors of America.\n</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">The picture is bleaker for those in the low-skill corners of the economy.\n</span><span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019re still finding a lot of skilled jobs come open, but it\u2019s certainly slowed down for the unskilled,\u201d said Robert A. Funk, chairman and chief executive of Express Employment Professionals, a staffing agency based in Oklahoma City <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">with 750 offices</span>.\n</span>Skilled workers are at a premium at Advanced Technology Services, a manufacturing consulting company based in Peoria, Ill.\n\u201cWhere we\u2019re struggling is in the area of talented people in manufacturing,\u201d Jeff Owens, the company\u2019s president, said, mentioning that he would like to add <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 160 managers</span>, electricians, information technology workers and machinists to <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 3,300</span>-person staff.\nLocation also matters. Mr. Funk, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said he observed a slowing down in the last six weeks, with the biggest drop-offs in the oil-drilling states, including Texas, Oklahoma and North and South Dakota.\n<span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Others fear that the economy is never going to deliver many gains to workers who have been waiting years to receive any bounty from the upswing in business activity.\n</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">William Spriggs, chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said: \u201cWe\u2019ve pretty much reached a kind of stability, and the unemployment rate will continue to fall, mostly because of retirements.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">An analysis this week from Morgan Stanley noted that the decline in the unemployment rate <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 5.1 percent</span> in August, <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 5.5 percent</span> in May, was almost entirely attributable to changes in the labor force participation rate.</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">The percentage of the working-age population that is employed \u2014 which many economists consider a better indicator of the health of the job market than the official jobless figure \u2014 has stayed flat at <span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">under 60 percent</span> for several years, still well below its prerecession level of <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 63.</span>\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">Public sector jobs were one of the few bright spots, growing <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">by 24,000 in</span> September, thanks to hiring on the state and local level.</span> <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">But government workers \u2014 from teachers to police officers to transit workers \u2014 have not made up the lost ground, said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-oriented research organization in Washington.\n</span>\u201cThe number of teachers and education staff

Wedo our work in a strictly nonpolitical way, based on detailed analysis, which we put on the record transparently,\u201d Mr. Powell said in an interview with American Public Media\u2019s \u201cMarketplace\u201d radio program.\nThe nonpolitical approach \u201cis deep in our DNA,\u201d Mr. Powell added.\n<span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">The Fed cut its benchmark rate to near zero to boost demand after <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2008 financial</span> crisis, and it held the rate there far longer than many observers expected.</span> Officials began to gradually lift rates in <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">late 2015.</span> Last fall, the central bank also began to slowly shrink <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $4.3 trillion</span> bond portfolio it amassed during several rounds of asset purchases designed to lower long-term rates and further stimulate growth.\n<span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">While former President Ronald Reagan was reluctant to publicly question Mr. Volcker, his White House frequently criticized Fed policy and nominated several governors who outvoted Mr. Volcker, a rare rebuke.\n</span><span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Former President George H.W. Bush, when he was vice president and seeking the presidency <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1988,</span> fretted publicly that the Fed might take steps to slow the economy.</span> <span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Some White House officials blamed Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan for not cutting rates quickly enough after the 1990-91 recession, which they thought cost Mr. Bush <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">his 1992 re</span>-election bid.\n</span><span id=\"33\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">In 1993,</span> a top adviser to then-President Bill Clinton began enforcing a rule within the White House that the Fed\u2019s policy decisions shouldn\u2019t be publicly questioned.</span> That rule largely held under the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. It also was followed until this year in Mr. Trump\u2019s White House.\n<span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Former White House economic adviser Gary Cohn emphasized to colleagues the importance to markets of not publicly second-guessing monetary policy decisions.</span> He left the White House in April.\n<span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">After a portion of Mr. Trump\u2019s interview aired on Thursday, a White House spokeswoman issued a statement that read in part, \u201cOf course the president respects the independence of the Fed.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Mr. Trump said during the interview that he knew some people didn\u2019t think it was appropriate for the president to comment on interest rates or the dollar, but he said of those concerns, \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less what they say.\u201d\nAt a conference in Sweden earlier this year, Mr. Powell said an erosion of trust in public institutions had created special challenges for central banks.</span> Those institutions \u201ccannot take our measure of independence for granted,\u201d he said.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com\nAppeared in the <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">July 20,</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2018,</span> print edition as 'Breaking Custom, Trump Raps Fed.'\n</span><span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">Most Popular Videos\nMost Popular Articles\n-\nTrump Aides Did Damage Control on Air Force One After Putin Meeting\n-\nFirst Test Drive of the Tesla <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Model 3 Performance</span>: A Thrilling, Modern Marvel\n-\nTrump Criticizes Fed Rate Rises in Break With Policy Custom\n-\nHoly Director\u2019s Cut, Batman!</span> <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">\u2018Justice League\u2019 Fans Demand New Version of a Superhero Flop\n-\nA Nearly Century-Old Steam Pipe Explodes in Manhattan</span>"}, "286": {"id": "286", "text": "<h3>Winners and Losers in the Trump Tax Plan</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">The tax plan the Trump administration released Wednesday consists (so far) of a single page of bullet points.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">If this were a more rounded plan, we could wait for the tax wonks at various think tanks to run it through their models and tell with some precision how it would affect people at different income levels and who would benefit from different deductions.\n</span>Lacking that level of detail, we can know only in broad-brush strokes which Americans would win and which would lose.

Surge as Employers Shed Jobs: Live Updates\nAmerican employers continue to shed workers at a staggering rate as a resurgent coronavirus and the absence of new federal aid take a toll on economic growth.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">The Labor Department reported Thursday <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">that 886,000 Americans</span> filed new claims for

the total <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">was 898,000.</span>\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">After dropping in late spring and early summer as pandemic-related lockdowns eased, new claims for state jobless benefits had been steadily totaling <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 800,000 a</span> week.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">\u201cIt\u2019s discouraging,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</span> \u201cWe\u2019re still stuck at a level of claims that\u2019s far higher than it was during the worst of what followed the crash <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2008.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">The labor market appears to be stalled, which underscores the need for new stimulus as quickly as possible.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">New claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, an emergency federal program that covers freelancers, self-employed workers, part-timers and others who don\u2019t qualify for benefits under the regular unemployment system, were tallied <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 373,000,</span> down <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 474,000.</span></span> Most of the decline reflected an aberration in Arizona, which has been dealing with fraud issues in the program and reported no new claims.\n<span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">The data do not include fresh figures for California, which has temporarily stopped accepting new unemployment applications to address a huge processing backlog and weed out fraud.</span> Instead, the report incorporated the last weekly figures available.\n<span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">The lack of fresh data from California makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions, but the latest numbers \u201cpoint to a lot of churn in the labor market, and it appears the rate of firings has picked up,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays.\n</span><span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">Over the past month, large employers including United Airlines, Disney and Allstate announced tens of thousands of layoffs, and more are expected as sectors like leisure and hospitality struggle.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">In some states, restaurants have salvaged some business by serving diners outside, but many will lose that option as temperatures fall.\n</span><span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">Despite the widespread economic pain, Republicans and Democrats in Washington have been unable to agree on a new relief package, a failure that may cause the economy to slow further in the coming months.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">Federal benefits created in March to supplement state payments to the unemployed are set to expire by the end of the year.\n</span>Steven Mnuchin says he will back the Democrats\u2019 testing proposal, but hurdles remain in reaching a deal.\n<span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday that the White House was willing to make additional concessions to Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California in hopes of rekindling a stimulus deal before the election.\n</span><span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">Speaking on CNBC, the Treasury secretary said that he would agree to the language that Democrats had insisted on when it came to a coronavirus testing program and noted that the two sides had already agreed to spend an <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">additional $75 billion</span> on testing and contact tracing.</span> The specifics of such a program have been an obstacle in the talks.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll fundamentally agree with their testing language, subject to some minor issues,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cWe need to get money to the American public now.\u201d\n<span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">The Treasury secretary is expected to speak to Ms. Pelosi later on Thursday.\n</span><span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s remarks came after the Labor Department reported that the number of new claims for unemployment benefits jumped <span id=\"8\"

He asserted that the virus was \u201ccontained in the U.S., to date, but now we just don\u2019t know,\u201d according to a document describing the sessions obtained by The New York Times.\nThe document, written by a hedge fund consultant who attended the three-day gathering of Hoover\u2019s board, was stark. \u201cWhat struck me,\u201d the consultant wrote, was that nearly every official he heard from raised the virus \u201cas a point of concern, totally unprovoked.\u201d\nThe consultant\u2019s assessment quickly spread through parts of the investment world. U.S. stocks were already spiraling because of a warning from a federal public health official that the virus was likely to spread, but traders spotted the immediate significance: The president\u2019s aides appeared to be giving wealthy party donors an early warning of a potentially impactful contagion at a time when Mr. Trump was publicly insisting that the threat was nonexistent.\n<span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">Interviews with eight people who either received copies of the memo or were briefed on aspects of it as it spread among investors in New York and elsewhere provide a glimpse of how elite traders had access to information from the administration that helped them gain financial advantage during a chaotic three days when global markets were teetering.\n</span>To many of the investors who received or heard about the memo, it was the first significant sign of skepticism among Trump administration officials about their ability to contain the virus.

On Wednesday, Mr. Mnuchin acknowledged it would be difficult to pass and enact a deal in the next three weeks.\nIn the interview on CNBC, Mr. Mnuchin did not directly address the lack of support for a bill by Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, suggesting that he has been briefed on negotiations between the White House and House Democrats while acknowledging that Senate Republicans prefer a more \u201ctargeted\u201d relief bill.\nNegotiators have been locked in fruitless talks for months. <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">On Thursday, Mr. Mnuchin assailed Democrats for letting politics get in the way of reaching agreement before the election, though President Trump scuttled the talks himself when he said in a tweet last week that he had called off stimulus negotiations until after the election.</span> The majority of Senate Republicans have also warned that they cannot accept the <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">latest $1.8 trillion</span> framework Mr. Mnuchin has put forward, even as Ms. Pelosi insists that plan is inadequate.\nMr. Mnuchin also called on Congress to give him the authority to repurpose <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">approximately $300 billion</span> in unused relief money from the legislation that was passed in March. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">He said he could begin getting that money into the economy this week.\n</span><span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">Advertisement\nMore and more Americans are relying on a federal program designed to help the jobless as state unemployment benefits run out.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">The program, Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, was created by Congress in March to <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">provide 13 weeks</span> of aid when regular state unemployment benefits expire \u2014 typically <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">after 26 weeks</span>.\n</span><span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">It has now been more <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 30 weeks</span> since unemployment claims spiked in March, when the pandemic first forced the economy into lockdown mode, so millions of unemployed Americans are starting to qualify for the extended benefits.\n</span>But getting on the rolls isn\u2019t easy, experts say. <span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe transition from regular state benefits to P.E.U.C. is not going smoothly,\u201d said Heidi Shierholz, senior economist and director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">In some places, recipients of state unemployment benefits haven\u2019t been notified of their eligibility for the federal extension, and aging computer systems have slowed the processing of applications.\n</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Still, in the week that ended Sept.<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 26,</span> the most recent period with available data, <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">nearly 2.8 million</span> people were getting Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation benefits, a jump from fewer than two million the previous week.</span> That increase was roughly equal to the decline in the number collecting state benefits.\nThe federal program is set to expire at the end of the year, and if it is not extended by Congress, \u201cwe\u2019re going to see a disaster,\u201d Ms. Shierholz said. <span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">\u201cThere will be a huge drop in living standards and an increase in poverty as well as downward pressure on economic growth.\u201d\n</span>For those who qualify, the program has helped as they search for work.\n<span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">Jared Gaxiola of Torrance, Calif., was laid off from his job as a freelance lighting technician in March, after live events were canceled across the country.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">When Mr. Gaxiola\u2019s state benefits ran out in mid-September, he was able to get a 13-week extension through Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation.\n</span><span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">Mr. Gaxiola,<span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 35,</span> hopes to find a job by the time the payments run out again in December.</span> But with entertainment work still scarce, he worries about how he will pay his rent in the new year.\n\u201cI could probably borrow money from my sister if I needed to,\u201d Mr. Gaxiola said. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t want to have to do that.\u201d\n\u2014 Nelson D.

But in March, when the pandemic hit, the family she worked for on the Upper East Side left the city, and all of her photography gigs dried up.\n<span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Ms. Polizzi,<span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"48\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 24,</span></span> filed for unemployment benefits and started receiving <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $200 a</span> week from the state, as well as <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $600 federal</span> supplement.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Those payments enabled her to meet expenses \u2014 including <span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $1,100 rent</span> for her apartment in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn \u2014 while she looked for a job.\n</span>But <span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the $600 payments</span> expired at the end of July.

Philipson, a senior economic adviser to the president, told the group he could not yet estimate the effects of the virus on the American economy.</span> To some in the group, the implication was that an outbreak could prove worse than Mr. Philipson and other Trump administration advisers were signaling in public at the time.\n<span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">The next day, board members \u2014 many of them Republican donors \u2014 got another taste of government uncertainty from Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council.</span> Hours after he had boasted on CNBC that the virus was contained in the United States and \u201cit\u2019s pretty close to airtight,\u201d Mr. Kudlow delivered a more ambiguous private message. He asserted that the virus was \u201ccontained in the U.S., to date, but now we just don\u2019t know,\u201d according to a document describing the sessions obtained by The New York Times.\nThe document, written by a hedge fund consultant who attended the three-day gathering of Hoover\u2019s board, was stark. \u201cWhat struck me,\u201d the consultant wrote, was that nearly every official he heard from raised the virus \u201cas a point of concern, totally unprovoked.\u201d\nThe consultant\u2019s assessment quickly spread through parts of the investment world. U.S. stocks were already spiraling because of a warning from a federal public health official that the virus was likely to spread, but traders spotted the immediate significance: The president\u2019s aides appeared to be giving wealthy party donors an early warning of a potentially impactful contagion at a time when Mr. Trump was publicly insisting that the threat was nonexistent.\n<span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">Interviews with eight people who either received copies of the memo or were briefed on aspects of it as it spread among investors in New York and elsewhere provide a glimpse of how elite traders had access to information from the administration that helped them gain financial advantage during a chaotic three days when global markets were teetering.\n</span>To many of the investors who received or heard about the memo, it was the first significant sign of skepticism among Trump administration officials about their ability to contain the virus. It also provided a hint of the fallout that was to come, said one major investor who was briefed on it: the upending of daily life for the entire country.\n<span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">\u201cShort everything,\u201d was the reaction of the investor, using the Wall Street term for betting on the idea that the stock prices of companies would soon fall.\n</span><span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">\u2014 Kate Kelly and\nAmericans used one-time stimulus checks they received from the federal government early in the pandemic to pad their savings accounts and pay off debt, new research from the Federal Reserve shows.\n</span><span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">Households spent <span id=\"49\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">just 29 percent</span> of the money they received earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a post on its website, citing its Survey of Consumer Expectations, conducted in June and August.</span> <span id=\"49\" class=\"red\"><span id=\"50\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">Another 36 percent</span> of the cash was saved, <span id=\"51\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">while 35 percent</span> was used to pay down debt.\n</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">Americans adults who qualified for the stimulus received up <span id=\"52\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $1,200 each</span>, with an <span id=\"53\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">extra $500 added</span> per child in the household.</span> <span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">Out of the Fed\u2019s sample,<span id=\"54\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 89 percent</span> of households received money.\n</span><span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">Poorer families and those who lost jobs or income amid the pandemic were more likely to use their money to pay down debts, while richer families saved the money.\n</span><span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">\u201cThe economic impact payments, by increasing both household income and the debt pay down, contributed importantly to the sharp increase in the overall saving rate during the early months of the pandemic,\u201d the central bank\u2019s researchers wrote in the post.\n</span>Several factors might have been behind the relatively low spending and high saving. <span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">People were unsure when the economic crisis would clear up, the researchers wrote, and might have been acting cautiously.</span> They were on lockdown, which might have limited opportunities to spend, and some rent payments \u2014 which count as consumption \u2014 were delayed.\n<span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">The trends seem unlikely to change if new aid becomes available: In the August survey, the New York Fed asked what households might do if they received <span id=\"55\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">another $1,500 check</span>.</span> Respondents expect to spend even less of that money, <span id=\"56\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about 24 percent</span>.\n<span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">The newfound savings buffer cushioned the blow as expanded unemployment insurance expired.</span> <span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">Consumer spending has held up even though millions remain unemployed but are no longer receiving an <span id=\"57\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">extra $600 per</span> week from the federal government.\n</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"red\">\u201cWe\u2019re still benefiting from the stimulus,\u201d Randal K.

Calling and getting an automated message saying no one\u2019s available and hanging up on me. Calling and immediately getting a message in Spanish that I don\u2019t understand.

California, another state that has struggled with the deluge of filings, reported close <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 900,000 claims</span> last week, up <span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 186,000.</span> Those figures, unlike the nationwide total, are not adjusted for seasonal patterns.\nIn a news conference this week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said he knew the state\u2019s claims system wasn\u2019t keeping up with the surge, and he said hundreds of people were working to expand capacity.\n\u201cThe site is so deluged that it keeps crashing because you literally have hundreds of thousands of people at any time trying to get on the site,\u201d he said. \u201cI apologize for the pain. It must be infuriating.\u201d\n<span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">Economists, too, have struggled to keep pace with the speed of the collapse.</span> A month ago, most forecasters still thought the United States could avoid a recession. <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">Today, many economists are expecting a decline in gross domestic product that rivals the worst periods of the Great Depression.\n</span><span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">On Friday, the Labor Department will release its monthly report on hiring and unemployment, usually one of the most-watched indicators on the economic calendar.</span> But the data was collected in early March, an eon ago in the coronavirus age. <span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">Most forecasters expect it to show only a modest uptick in the unemployment rate and a small decline in jobs, despite the wave of layoffs that hit later in the month.\n</span>For workers and businesses, the reversal of fortune has been head-spinning.\n<span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Barely a month ago, Elizabeth Mora quit her job in Utah to take a new position as a supply chain manager for MGM Resorts in Las Vegas.</span> But by the time she crossed the state line in a moving truck two weeks later, the hospitality industry was beginning to shut down. <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">After two days on the job she was furloughed, and the MGM hotel where she was staying temporarily as part of her relocation package had closed.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">\u201cIn a moment, I became both jobless and homeless,\u201d she said.\n</span>Now Ms. Mora is staying with an acquaintance and living out of the suitcase she filled with two weeks\u2019 worth of clothes when she moved. The rest of her belongings are in a storage facility. <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">She is applying for any job she can find and briefly considered selling home-baked bread \u2014 until she discovered that the local grocery stores had no more flour.\n</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">When she accepted the job at MGM, Ms. Mora said, she was excited to begin a new phase.</span> Now, she said, she is just trying to survive.\n\u201cI picked up my entire life and I moved here, not only physically but emotionally,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt the sense of uncertainty like I do

If Democrats win a majority in either chamber of Congress, the law would be protected; a GOP sweep could further embolden repeal attempts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s right on the balance there,\u201d said Robert J. Blendon, a Harvard professor of health policy and political analysis. \u201cThe viability of the program is heavily dependent on the outcome of the election, not the changes in between.\u201d\nWith recent polls showing health care remains a top concern among voters, both major political parties have an incentive to wield it as an election issue. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Democrats are likely to argue that the GOP wants to take coverage away from millions of Americans, with Republicans focusing on escalating insurance prices.\n</span>What happens in the interim, health policy analysts say, depends on how events play out in three arenas \u2014 Capitol Hill, the White House and the insurance industry.\nAfter a year of full GOP control, congressional Republicans and the White House have damaged the ACA but fallen short of their vehement goal of dismantling broad swaths of it. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">More ambiguous is whether their end-of-year victory \u2014 removing tax penalties starting <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019 for</span> people who violate the insurance mandate \u2014 will whet the GOP\u2019s appetite for taking apart more of the law.\n</span>\u201cTo those who believe \u2014 including Senate Republican leadership \u2014 that <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018 </span>there</span> will not be another effort to repeal and replace Obamacare \u2014 well you are sadly mistaken,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted last week.\nGraham\u2019s vow was a rejoinder to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who suggested in an NPR interview that \u201cwe\u2019ll probably move on to other issues.\u201d He also noted that the chamber\u2019s slender GOP majority will shrink to one senator once the Democratic winner of a special election in Alabama is sworn in next month.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">McConnell reiterated his intention to try to coax the Senate early in the year to adopt two measures, promised to a crucial Senate Republican moderate in exchange for her support of the massive tax overhaul enacted last week, that would help cushion ACA insurance marketplaces.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">One bill would restore for two years the payments that the law guarantees insurers \u2014 estimated <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at $8 billion</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018 </span>\u2014 to reimburse them for discounts that ACA health plans must give lower-income customers for deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses.</span> President Trump cut off the payments in October.\nThe other bill would provide <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $10 billion</span> over two years to help states create high-risk pools or otherwise help insurers cope with customers with especially high medical costs. House conservatives fiercely opposed both measures.\nMeanwhile, the administration is pressing forward with at least one more jab at the ACA marketplaces. As directed by an executive order that President Trump signed this fall, officials are finishing a draft rule to make it easier for insurers to sell meager but inexpensive health plans that skirt the law\u2019s coverage requirements.\nThe ground-level effect of such changes for consumers rests in large part on how the insurance industry responds. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Without the measure to help stabilize the law\u2019s marketplaces and with greater availability of skimpy health plans, \u201cwe risk the individual market on the exchanges becoming a de facto high-risk pool,\u201d said one industry official not authorized to speak on the record.</span> That means premiums would soar, causing those exchanges to shrink and become the province of sick, expensive customers.\nOn the other hand, said Joseph Antos, a health-care scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, more expensive premiums could \u201cmove in the opposite direction of knocking down the ACA\u201d because the law\u2019s premium subsidies would rise to keep pace.

If Democrats win a majority in either chamber of Congress, the law would be protected; a GOP sweep could further embolden repeal attempts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s right on the balance there,\u201d said Robert J. Blendon, a Harvard professor of health policy and political analysis. \u201cThe viability of the program is heavily dependent on the outcome of the election, not the changes in between.\u201d\nWith recent polls showing health care remains a top concern among voters, both major political parties have an incentive to wield it as an election issue. <span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">Democrats are likely to argue that the GOP wants to take coverage away from millions of Americans, with Republicans focusing on escalating insurance prices.\n</span>What happens in the interim, health policy analysts say, depends on how events play out in three arenas \u2014 Capitol Hill, the White House and the insurance industry.\nAfter a year of full GOP control, congressional Republicans and the White House have damaged the ACA but fallen short of their vehement goal of dismantling broad swaths of it. <span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">More ambiguous is whether their end-of-year victory \u2014 removing tax penalties starting <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2019 for</span> people who violate the insurance mandate \u2014 will whet the GOP\u2019s appetite for taking apart more of the law.\n</span>\u201cTo those who believe \u2014 including Senate Republican leadership \u2014 that <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"><span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018 </span>there</span> will not be another effort to repeal and replace Obamacare \u2014 well you are sadly mistaken,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted last week.\nGraham\u2019s vow was a rejoinder to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who suggested in an NPR interview that \u201cwe\u2019ll probably move on to other issues.\u201d He also noted that the chamber\u2019s slender GOP majority will shrink to one senator once the Democratic winner of a special election in Alabama is sworn in next month.\n<span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">McConnell reiterated his intention to try to coax the Senate early in the year to adopt two measures, promised to a crucial Senate Republican moderate in exchange for her support of the massive tax overhaul enacted last week, that would help cushion ACA insurance marketplaces.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">One bill would restore for two years the payments that the law guarantees insurers \u2014 estimated <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at $8 billion</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2018 </span>\u2014 to reimburse them for discounts that ACA health plans must give lower-income customers for deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses.</span> President Trump cut off the payments in October.\nThe other bill would provide <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">about $10 billion</span> over two years to help states create high-risk pools or otherwise help insurers cope with customers with especially high medical costs. House conservatives fiercely opposed both measures.\nMeanwhile, the administration is pressing forward with at least one more jab at the ACA marketplaces. As directed by an executive order that President Trump signed this fall, officials are finishing a draft rule to make it easier for insurers to sell meager but inexpensive health plans that skirt the law\u2019s coverage requirements.\nThe ground-level effect of such changes for consumers rests in large part on how the insurance industry responds. <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Without the measure to help stabilize the law\u2019s marketplaces and with greater availability of skimpy health plans, \u201cwe risk the individual market on the exchanges becoming a de facto high-risk pool,\u201d said one industry official not authorized to speak on the record.</span> That means premiums would soar, causing those exchanges to shrink and become the province of sick, expensive customers.\nOn the other hand, said Joseph Antos, a health-care scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, more expensive premiums could \u201cmove in the opposite direction of knocking down the ACA\u201d because the law\u2019s premium subsidies would rise to keep pace. For the more <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">than 80 percent</span> of ACA customers who qualify for those subsidies, he said, more generous subsidies could make it easier to afford higher tiers of coverage, motivating more people to sign up.\nSuch hard-to-predict boomerang effects could be true of the insurance mandate as well.
