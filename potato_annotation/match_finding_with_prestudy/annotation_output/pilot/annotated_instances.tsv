The researchers first identified the most common grievances people had about smartphone use among their colleagues, including browsing the Internet and checking text messages.  Not surprisingly, millennials and younger professionals were more likely to be accepting of smartphone use, but they might be doing themselves a disservice,  Cardon said."">Not surprisingly, millennials and younger professionals were more likely to be accepting of smartphone use, but they might be doing themselves a disservice, Cardon said.</span> </div><div name=""instance_text"" style=""float:left;width:50%;padding:5px;"" class=""column""> <legend> Paper </legend> <span data-toggle=""tooltip"" data-html=""true"" data-placement=""bottom"" title=""Context: Based on the findings, we have made several basic conclusions.

The researchers found that people remember information better if it is presented to them in a virtual environment.

This suggests an exciting opportunity for the role of immersive virtual environments in assisting in recall.

As reported in Nature, the researchers found for the first time that there are limitations on how adaptable the brain is during learning and that these restrictions are a key determinant for whether a new skill will be easy or difficult to learn. Understanding how the brain's activity can be  flexed  during learning could eventually be used to develop better treatments for stroke and other brain injuries."">For example, a trained pianist can learn a new melody easier than learning how to hit a tennis serve.</span> </div><div name=""instance_text"" style=""float:left;width:50%;padding:5px;"" class=""column""> <legend> Paper </legend> <span data-toggle=""tooltip"" data-html=""true"" data-placement=""bottom"" title=""Context: By construction, the intuitive mapping lies within the intrinsic manifold.
