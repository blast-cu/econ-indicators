{"id": "8036", "displayed_text": "<h3>The Fed Missed Inflation. Can Jay Powell Tame It Without Causing a Recession?</h3><span id=\"0\" class=\"red\">During the first year of the pandemic, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell earned a reputation as a monetary dove, rolling out innovative policies aimed at preventing a financial and economic meltdown.\n</span><span id=\"1\" class=\"red\">Today, he is changing into a hawk willing to be equally improvisational to tame inflation, now running at a 40-year high <span id=\"0\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 7.5%.</span>\n</span><span id=\"2\" class=\"red\">Whether he succeeds will go a long way to determine the future path of the economy as well as the central bank\u2019s credibility.\n</span><span id=\"3\" class=\"red\">The need for the about-face is partly of the Fed\u2019s own making.</span> <span id=\"4\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell responded to the pandemic by doubling down on strategies developed by his predecessors to combat prolonged high unemployment and very low inflation.</span> <span id=\"5\" class=\"red\">When the labor market healed rapidly and high inflation emerged as the bigger threat, he and his colleagues were caught by surprise.\n</span>\u201cWe\u2019re pretty far behind the curve. <span id=\"6\" class=\"red\">That\u2019s not where we wanted to be,\u201d said Eric Rosengren, who as president of the Boston Fed until last September had a hand in designing those policies.\n</span>In some ways, Mr. Powell\u2019s challenge is thornier than it was at the outset of the pandemic. <span id=\"7\" class=\"red\">No Fed chairman since Paul Volcker in the early 1980s has had to grapple with inflation this high.</span> <span id=\"8\" class=\"red\">The risk for Mr. Powell and the nation is that his fight against inflation will cause a new recession, as Mr. Volcker\u2019s did.</span> <span id=\"9\" class=\"red\">Historically, the Fed hasn\u2019t been able to push down inflation without a recession.\n</span>Exactly how Mr. Powell intends to tighten policy represents an additional challenge. <span id=\"10\" class=\"red\">The Fed has both the traditional lever of short-term interest rates and a newfangled one: shrinking its vast holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.</span> <span id=\"11\" class=\"red\">This could be especially treacherous for markets accustomed to a central bank that for the past two decades mostly used just interest rates, and tried to telegraph how fast it would raise them.\n</span><span id=\"12\" class=\"red\">Fed officials warn they can\u2019t provide that same predictability this time.</span> <span id=\"13\" class=\"red\">For markets \u201cit could be a bumpy time,\u201d said Esther George, president of the Kansas City Fed.\n</span><span id=\"14\" class=\"red\">In less than a year, the Fed went from projecting no interest rate increases <span id=\"1\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">before 2024 to</span> signaling it will raise rates at its next meeting, March 15-16, for the first time <span id=\"2\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2018.</span></span> Then just in the past week, investors have begun anticipating a half-point instead of quarter-point increase at that meeting, which would be the first one that big <span id=\"3\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2000.</span>\n<span id=\"15\" class=\"red\">No past Fed chair has had to deal with a shutdown of the U.S.\u2019s economy and those of trading partners, as Mr. Powell confronted.</span> <span id=\"16\" class=\"red\">A great deal hangs on issues outside of his control, including to what extent the virus recedes, how quickly supply chains heal and how much working arrangements and spending preferences revert to pre-pandemic patterns.\n</span>Mr. Powell has been nominated by President Biden for a second term and is expected to win bipartisan backing in the Senate confirmation vote. <span id=\"17\" class=\"red\">Republicans delayed a scheduled confirmation vote in the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, objecting to one of Mr. Biden\u2019s other Fed picks.</span> All but one of <span id=\"4\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 12 Democrats</span> on the panel indicated they would support Mr. Powell once the vote occurs.\n<span id=\"18\" class=\"red\">When the pandemic hit in <span id=\"5\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">early 2020,</span> Mr. Powell ran through a crisis-fighting playbook from former Chairman Ben Bernanke and then added new pages, doing things the Fed had never done before, such as making loans directly to cities, states, and businesses.\n</span><span id=\"19\" class=\"red\">Though the worst of the financial crisis had passed by June, the economic situation was still bleak.</span> <span id=\"20\" class=\"red\">Unemployment peaked <span id=\"6\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">at 14.7%,</span> which didn\u2019t include millions of Americans who\u2019d left the workforce.\n</span><span id=\"21\" class=\"red\">In <span id=\"7\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">August 2020,</span> Mr. Powell led his colleagues to adopt a policy framework designed to address a problem that had long dogged the Fed and other central banks, and that the pandemic threatened to worsen: inflation running persistently below <span id=\"8\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">the 2% target</span>.\n</span><span id=\"22\" class=\"red\">Under the Fed\u2019s old framework, it would raise interest rates pre-emptively.</span> <span id=\"23\" class=\"red\">Rather than wait until inflation was <span id=\"9\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">above 2%,</span> it would act when unemployment was falling, to prevent inflation from <span id=\"10\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">exceeding 2%.</span>\n</span><span id=\"24\" class=\"red\">The new framework rejected pre-emptive strikes on inflation.</span> <span id=\"25\" class=\"red\">To put this new framework into action, they pledged in <span id=\"11\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">September 2020 to</span> maintain rates near zero until labor-market conditions were consistent with maximum employment\u2014which wasn\u2019t fully defined but generally corresponds with historically low levels of unemployment\u2014and until inflation <span id=\"12\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">reached 2% and</span> headed higher.\n</span><span id=\"26\" class=\"red\">To further hasten the fall in unemployment, the Fed would <span id=\"13\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">buy $120 billion</span> in Treasurys and mortgage bonds each month.</span> <span id=\"27\" class=\"red\">The goal was to send investors into riskier assets, buoying stocks, corporate bonds and real estate by lowering long-term interest rates.</span> <span id=\"28\" class=\"red\">In theory, buying longer-dated securities would reduce what economists call a \u201cterm premium,\u201d or the extra yield investors demand for the risk of lending over a long term.\n</span><span id=\"29\" class=\"red\">The Fed and many private-sector economists were caught off guard by how the economy responded as it reopened last year.</span> <span id=\"30\" class=\"red\">Unemployment fell much more quickly than expected\u2014<span id=\"14\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 4% last</span> month <span id=\"15\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 5.9% in</span> June.</span> <span id=\"31\" class=\"red\">Wages ratcheted steadily higher as employers faced shortages of labor.\n</span><span id=\"32\" class=\"red\">Inflation surged last spring, driven by brisk demand for goods and by shipping bottlenecks and shortages for intermediate goods such as semiconductors.</span> <span id=\"33\" class=\"red\">Fed officials attributed the surge to idiosyncratic increases in the prices of a handful of items tied to reopening the economy, which they thought would be short-lived.\n</span><span id=\"34\" class=\"red\">Instead, price pressures broadened.</span> <span id=\"35\" class=\"red\">Few economists, inside or outside the Fed, imagined such a large surge in inflation when the new framework was adopted.</span> <span id=\"36\" class=\"red\">Yet Fed officials felt compelled to hold rates at zero and continue adding to their bond portfolio to adhere to their guidance laid down for reaching maximum employment.\n</span>\u201cThat guidance, in retrospect, does not look like it was ideal,\u201d said Mr. Rosengren.\n<span id=\"37\" class=\"red\">Additionally, Mr. Powell and his colleagues were slow to revise their forecasts for growth, inflation and interest rates after President Biden signed <span id=\"16\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $1.9 trillion</span> fiscal stimulus bill into law in <span id=\"17\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2021,</span> though a handful of economists, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, warned the spending could feed inflation.</span> <span id=\"38\" class=\"red\">On the heels of <span id=\"18\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">a $900 billion</span> measure former President Donald Trump approved at the end <span id=\"19\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 2020,</span> that boost in retrospect should \u201chave set their antennas quivering more than it did,\u201d said Donald Kohn, a former Fed vice chairman.\n</span>By late last summer, Mr. Powell began to pivot. <span id=\"39\" class=\"red\">In November he initiated a plan to reduce the Fed\u2019s monthly bond buying to zero over eight months, clearing the way to raise rates by mid-2022.\n</span><span id=\"40\" class=\"red\">But the labor market was tightening fast, and inflation pressures, rather than easing, broadened.</span> In December, Mr. Powell said the purchases would end by March, allowing rate rises to begin immediately after.\nFor the central bank, it was an uncharacteristic about-face. \u201cAs the data came in, they said, \u2018We were wrong.\u2019 <span id=\"41\" class=\"red\">How often do you hear the Fed say that?\u201d said Mr. Kohn.\n</span>Despite the quick shift, the policy response still had room to catch up, Mr. Kohn said. <span id=\"42\" class=\"red\">As recently as December, Fed officials continued to signal they would tighten monetary policy much as they had in the past: with a mild path of rate increases over the next three years.</span> <span id=\"43\" class=\"red\">They premised that on inflation falling <span id=\"20\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 2%,</span> even though they expected growth and unemployment to run at levels that would apply upward pressure on inflation.\n</span>\u201cThe forecast didn\u2019t add up,\u201d said Mr. Kohn.\n<span id=\"44\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell seemed to acknowledge as much at a news conference after the Fed\u2019s meeting last month.</span> He hinted at a faster path of rate increases and declined to rule out raising rates at consecutive policy meetings, which hasn\u2019t happened <span id=\"21\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2006,</span> or by a half percentage point at once. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to say exactly how this is going to go,\u201d he said.\nThat marks an important break from rate-rise cycles that began <span id=\"22\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2004 and</span><span id=\"23\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2015,</span> and it could make the current cycle more <span id=\"24\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">like 1994.</span> <span id=\"45\" class=\"red\">That year, after a prolonged period of low, stable rates, the Fed under then-Chairman Alan Greenspan raised <span id=\"25\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">rates 3 percentage</span> points in a one-year span.\n</span><span id=\"46\" class=\"red\">The unexpectedly rapid tightening hammered bond prices more than almost any other move in the postwar era.</span> <span id=\"47\" class=\"red\">Orange County, Calif., went bankrupt and Mexico devalued its peso, ravaging its economy.</span> <span id=\"48\" class=\"red\">The Fed lowered rates modestly <span id=\"26\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 1995 amid</span> fears the economy might slide into recession.\n</span><span id=\"49\" class=\"red\">When Mr. Greenspan again prepared to raise rates <span id=\"27\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2004,</span> he incorporated the advice of Mr. Bernanke, an accomplished academic and then a Fed governor, who said that clearer guidance about the Fed\u2019s goals and intentions could lead to more effective policy.\n</span><span id=\"50\" class=\"red\">\u201cAmbiguity has its uses, but mostly in noncooperative games like poker,\u201d Mr. Bernanke told colleagues <span id=\"28\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">in 2003,</span> according to transcripts of a Fed policy meeting that year.</span> <span id=\"51\" class=\"red\">\u201cMonetary policy is a cooperative game.</span> <span id=\"52\" class=\"red\">The whole point is to get financial markets on our side and for them to do some of our work for us.\u201d\n</span><span id=\"53\" class=\"red\">At their meeting next month, Fed officials will release new projections showing how much they expect to lift rates.</span> <span id=\"54\" class=\"red\">Thus far, their goal has been to raise them to \u201cneutral,\u201d a level that neither spurs nor slows growth, which officials estimate is <span id=\"29\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2% and</span><span id=\"30\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 3% when</span> inflation is near the Fed\u2019<span id=\"31\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">s 2% target</span>.</span> Unlike in recent years, and a departure from Mr. Bernanke\u2019s guidance, how fast they get there and whether they go higher remain open questions.\n<span id=\"55\" class=\"red\">Officials are hoping inflation declines as supply problems ease and demand shifts from goods, where prices rose sharply last year, toward services, where inflation has been less extreme.\n</span>There\u2019s plenty that could go wrong. <span id=\"56\" class=\"red\">Inflation might stay high because of factors outside of the Fed\u2019s control, such as a Russian invasion of Ukraine that roils energy markets, or shipping delays made worse by pandemic-driven lockdowns in Asia.</span> <span id=\"57\" class=\"red\">And even if prices of goods moderate this year as expected, increases in wages and rents could keep inflation elevated <span id=\"32\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">into 2023.</span>\n</span><span id=\"58\" class=\"red\">Mr. Powell has for now declined to provide so-called forward guidance about the policy path because the inflation outlook is so uncertain.\n</span><span id=\"59\" class=\"red\">The uncertainty over inflation and lack of Fed guidance is leading to greater volatility in bond markets.</span> Until last Thursday, officials played down the prospect of starting with a half-point rate increase or acting between regularly scheduled policy meetings.\n<span id=\"60\" class=\"red\">\u201cI prefer not to be deploying that kind of stuff if we can avoid it, and so far, I think we\u2019ve got a smooth response to the inflation surprise,\u201d said James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, in a Feb.<span id=\"33\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 7 interview</span>.\n</span><span id=\"61\" class=\"red\">After Thursday\u2019s report that inflation had climbed further to a 40-year high <span id=\"34\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">of 7.5%,</span> Mr. Bullard changed his message, telling Bloomberg News that he would favor a bolder, half-point increase or an inter-meeting rate increase in the coming months.\n</span><span id=\"62\" class=\"red\">His remarks accelerated the largest one-day jump in two-year Treasury bond yields <span id=\"35\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">since 2009 and</span> led futures markets to bet on a half-point increase next month.\n</span>If Mr. Powell and his colleagues deliver such a move, they could be criticized for panicking. <span id=\"63\" class=\"red\">If he opts for the smaller increase, he could be criticized for not taking inflation seriously enough.\n</span><span id=\"64\" class=\"red\">\u201cIdeally, the Fed would come out and exert control of the policy message,\u201d including by saying it will raise rates in a fashion that doesn\u2019t inflame fears of an emergency, said Brian Sack, who ran the New York Fed\u2019s markets desk <span id=\"36\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">from 2009 to</span><span id=\"37\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2012 and</span> is now the director of economics at hedge-fund manager D.E. Shaw.\n</span><span id=\"65\" class=\"red\">Market speculation that the Fed might raise rates in between meetings, which intensified after Mr. Bullard\u2019s remarks, fanned fears that policy isn\u2019t well positioned to restrain the economy and bring down inflation, analysts said.\n</span><span id=\"66\" class=\"red\">Complicating its deliberations, the Fed has more than one way of tightening policy by shrinking its bondholdings, which have more than doubled <span id=\"38\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to $9 trillion</span> since <span id=\"39\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">March 2020.</span>\n</span><span id=\"67\" class=\"red\">When the Fed shrank its holdings <span id=\"40\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">between 2017 and</span><span id=\"41\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2019,</span> it did so passively by allowing a certain amount of securities to mature without replacing them every month.</span> <span id=\"68\" class=\"red\">Some Fed officials, uncomfortable with having such a big presence in Treasurys, the world\u2019s most important financial market, believe high inflation calls for a faster retreat by actively selling assets to raise longer-term rates.</span> <span id=\"69\" class=\"red\">Ms. George, the Kansas City Fed leader, and Mr. Rosengren advocate that more aggressive path.\n</span><span id=\"70\" class=\"red\">Most Fed officials are cool to that, at least for now.</span> <span id=\"71\" class=\"red\">\u201cWhen you\u2019re adjusting policy substantially in other ways, introducing asset sales just complicates the path,\u201d said Mr. Sack.</span> \u201cThere\u2019s a risk of pouring fuel on the fire. The balance sheet is an instrument with still-uncertain effects, and you don\u2019t want to push it too hard.\u201d\n<span id=\"72\" class=\"red\">For now, that also appears to be the predominant view at the Fed.</span> Mr. Powell said last month he wants the program to run in the background. <span id=\"73\" class=\"red\">It would function more like the rhythm section in a band, allowing the Fed to move its benchmark rate up or down if it wants to adjust policy.\n</span>Looming over this is the reaction of the markets. Stocks, corporate bonds and real estate all reached historically high valuations in part on the assumption rates would remain very low for years. <span id=\"74\" class=\"red\">Though household borrowing as a share of U.S. gross domestic product is well below levels reached during the housing boom of 2004-06, corporate debt is near a record high.\n</span><span id=\"75\" class=\"red\">\u201cThere are people who are living in a world in which an aggressive Fed tightening\u2014an increasing possibility here\u2014is not an outcome they can accept, so they\u2019re pretending it won\u2019t happen,\u201d said Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at the investment firm Guggenheim Partners.</span> \u201cThe places where that\u2019s very real\u2014cryptocurrency, tech-related companies in private equity\u2014could be in deep trouble.\u201d\n<span id=\"76\" class=\"red\">Once there\u2019s a sharp decline in one of those sectors, that could set off volatility in other corners of the market, he said.\n</span><span id=\"77\" class=\"red\">Share Your Thoughts\nIs the Fed doing the right things to handle inflation?</span> Join the conversation below.\n<span id=\"78\" class=\"red\">Mr. Rosengren said the prospect of a soft landing for the economy has diminished over the past six months because of more persistent supply shocks and workers winning higher wages to offset higher prices.\n</span><span id=\"79\" class=\"red\">Rapidly raising rates to address the inflation problem increases the risks of a recession, he said.</span> <span id=\"80\" class=\"red\">\u201cIf you\u2019re raising rates rapidly, you don\u2019t have time to see how the rate increases you\u2019ve already done have slowed down the economy,\u201d he said.\n</span><span id=\"81\" class=\"red\">One danger is that the Fed faces a bind where inflation only partially reverses its recent climb.</span> <span id=\"82\" class=\"red\">That would leave officials forced to choose between accepting a somewhat higher inflation rate or forcing unemployment to rise to higher levels, risking a downturn.\n</span><span id=\"83\" class=\"red\">\u201cThey\u2019re saying they\u2019re going to keep inflation in check and I believe them, but they\u2019re suggesting not a lot of work will be necessary,\u201d said former New York Fed President William Dudley.</span> He believes rates will need to rise <span id=\"42\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">to 3% or</span><span id=\"43\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 4%,</span> which could damage markets.\n<span id=\"84\" class=\"red\">\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a lot less popular\u201d in that environment than the one the Fed was in during the past decade, said Mr. Dudley.\n</span><span id=\"85\" class=\"red\">Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com\nCopyright \u00a92022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.</span> All Rights Reserved. <span id=\"86\" class=\"red\">87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8\nAppeared in the <span id=\"44\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\">February 16,</span><span id=\"45\" class=\"yellow\" onclick=\"annotateQuant(this);\"> 2022,</span> print edition as 'The Fed\u2019s Slow Pivot To Tackling Inflation.'</span>", "label_annotations": {"frame-macro": {"Yes": "0"}, "Economic Conditions": {"Poor": "1"}, "Economic Direction": {"Getting worse": "1"}, "frame": {"Government revenue and expenses": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 15s "}}
