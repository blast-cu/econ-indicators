5e1907e796a3711d107baeb6,8036,"<h3>The Fed Missed Inflation. Can Jay Powell Tame It Without Causing a Recession?</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">During the first year of the pandemic, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell earned a reputation as a monetary dove, rolling out innovative policies aimed at preventing a financial and economic meltdown.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Today, he is changing into a hawk willing to be equally improvisational to tame inflation, now running at a 40-year high <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7.5%.</span>
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Whether he succeeds will go a long way to determine the future path of the economy as well as the central bank’s credibility.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The need for the about-face is partly of the Fed’s own making.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell responded to the pandemic by doubling down on strategies developed by his predecessors to combat prolonged high unemployment and very low inflation.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">When the labor market healed rapidly and high inflation emerged as the bigger threat, he and his colleagues were caught by surprise.
</span>“We’re pretty far behind the curve. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">That’s not where we wanted to be,” said Eric Rosengren, who as president of the Boston Fed until last September had a hand in designing those policies.
</span>In some ways, Mr. Powell’s challenge is thornier than it was at the outset of the pandemic. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">No Fed chairman since Paul Volcker in the early 1980s has had to grapple with inflation this high.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The risk for Mr. Powell and the nation is that his fight against inflation will cause a new recession, as Mr. Volcker’s did.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Historically, the Fed hasn’t been able to push down inflation without a recession.
</span>Exactly how Mr. Powell intends to tighten policy represents an additional challenge. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The Fed has both the traditional lever of short-term interest rates and a newfangled one: shrinking its vast holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">This could be especially treacherous for markets accustomed to a central bank that for the past two decades mostly used just interest rates, and tried to telegraph how fast it would raise them.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Fed officials warn they can’t provide that same predictability this time.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">For markets “it could be a bumpy time,” said Esther George, president of the Kansas City Fed.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">In less than a year, the Fed went from projecting no interest rate increases <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">before 2024 to</span> signaling it will raise rates at its next meeting, March 15-16, for the first time <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2018.</span></span> Then just in the past week, investors have begun anticipating a half-point instead of quarter-point increase at that meeting, which would be the first one that big <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2000.</span>
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">No past Fed chair has had to deal with a shutdown of the U.S.’s economy and those of trading partners, as Mr. Powell confronted.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">A great deal hangs on issues outside of his control, including to what extent the virus recedes, how quickly supply chains heal and how much working arrangements and spending preferences revert to pre-pandemic patterns.
</span>Mr. Powell has been nominated by President Biden for a second term and is expected to win bipartisan backing in the Senate confirmation vote. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Republicans delayed a scheduled confirmation vote in the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, objecting to one of Mr. Biden’s other Fed picks.</span> All but one of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 12 Democrats</span> on the panel indicated they would support Mr. Powell once the vote occurs.
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">When the pandemic hit in <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2020,</span> Mr. Powell ran through a crisis-fighting playbook from former Chairman Ben Bernanke and then added new pages, doing things the Fed had never done before, such as making loans directly to cities, states, and businesses.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Though the worst of the financial crisis had passed by June, the economic situation was still bleak.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">Unemployment peaked <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 14.7%,</span> which didn’t include millions of Americans who’d left the workforce.
</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">In <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">August 2020,</span> Mr. Powell led his colleagues to adopt a policy framework designed to address a problem that had long dogged the Fed and other central banks, and that the pandemic threatened to worsen: inflation running persistently below <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2% target</span>.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Under the Fed’s old framework, it would raise interest rates pre-emptively.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Rather than wait until inflation was <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">above 2%,</span> it would act when unemployment was falling, to prevent inflation from <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">exceeding 2%.</span>
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">The new framework rejected pre-emptive strikes on inflation.</span> <span id=""25"" class=""red"">To put this new framework into action, they pledged in <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">September 2020 to</span> maintain rates near zero until labor-market conditions were consistent with maximum employment—which wasn’t fully defined but generally corresponds with historically low levels of unemployment—and until inflation <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reached 2% and</span> headed higher.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">To further hasten the fall in unemployment, the Fed would <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">buy $120 billion</span> in Treasurys and mortgage bonds each month.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">The goal was to send investors into riskier assets, buoying stocks, corporate bonds and real estate by lowering long-term interest rates.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">In theory, buying longer-dated securities would reduce what economists call a “term premium,” or the extra yield investors demand for the risk of lending over a long term.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">The Fed and many private-sector economists were caught off guard by how the economy responded as it reopened last year.</span> <span id=""30"" class=""red"">Unemployment fell much more quickly than expected—<span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4% last</span> month <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 5.9% in</span> June.</span> <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Wages ratcheted steadily higher as employers faced shortages of labor.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">Inflation surged last spring, driven by brisk demand for goods and by shipping bottlenecks and shortages for intermediate goods such as semiconductors.</span> <span id=""33"" class=""red"">Fed officials attributed the surge to idiosyncratic increases in the prices of a handful of items tied to reopening the economy, which they thought would be short-lived.
</span><span id=""34"" class=""red"">Instead, price pressures broadened.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">Few economists, inside or outside the Fed, imagined such a large surge in inflation when the new framework was adopted.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Yet Fed officials felt compelled to hold rates at zero and continue adding to their bond portfolio to adhere to their guidance laid down for reaching maximum employment.
</span>“That guidance, in retrospect, does not look like it was ideal,” said Mr. Rosengren.
<span id=""37"" class=""red"">Additionally, Mr. Powell and his colleagues were slow to revise their forecasts for growth, inflation and interest rates after President Biden signed <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $1.9 trillion</span> fiscal stimulus bill into law in <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2021,</span> though a handful of economists, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, warned the spending could feed inflation.</span> <span id=""38"" class=""red"">On the heels of <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $900 billion</span> measure former President Donald Trump approved at the end <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2020,</span> that boost in retrospect should “have set their antennas quivering more than it did,” said Donald Kohn, a former Fed vice chairman.
</span>By late last summer, Mr. Powell began to pivot. <span id=""39"" class=""red"">In November he initiated a plan to reduce the Fed’s monthly bond buying to zero over eight months, clearing the way to raise rates by mid-2022.
</span><span id=""40"" class=""red"">But the labor market was tightening fast, and inflation pressures, rather than easing, broadened.</span> In December, Mr. Powell said the purchases would end by March, allowing rate rises to begin immediately after.
For the central bank, it was an uncharacteristic about-face. “As the data came in, they said, ‘We were wrong.’ <span id=""41"" class=""red"">How often do you hear the Fed say that?” said Mr. Kohn.
</span>Despite the quick shift, the policy response still had room to catch up, Mr. Kohn said. <span id=""42"" class=""red"">As recently as December, Fed officials continued to signal they would tighten monetary policy much as they had in the past: with a mild path of rate increases over the next three years.</span> <span id=""43"" class=""red"">They premised that on inflation falling <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 2%,</span> even though they expected growth and unemployment to run at levels that would apply upward pressure on inflation.
</span>“The forecast didn’t add up,” said Mr. Kohn.
<span id=""44"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell seemed to acknowledge as much at a news conference after the Fed’s meeting last month.</span> He hinted at a faster path of rate increases and declined to rule out raising rates at consecutive policy meetings, which hasn’t happened <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2006,</span> or by a half percentage point at once. “I don’t think it’s possible to say exactly how this is going to go,” he said.
That marks an important break from rate-rise cycles that began <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2004 and</span><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015,</span> and it could make the current cycle more <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">like 1994.</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">That year, after a prolonged period of low, stable rates, the Fed under then-Chairman Alan Greenspan raised <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rates 3 percentage</span> points in a one-year span.
</span><span id=""46"" class=""red"">The unexpectedly rapid tightening hammered bond prices more than almost any other move in the postwar era.</span> <span id=""47"" class=""red"">Orange County, Calif., went bankrupt and Mexico devalued its peso, ravaging its economy.</span> <span id=""48"" class=""red"">The Fed lowered rates modestly <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1995 amid</span> fears the economy might slide into recession.
</span><span id=""49"" class=""red"">When Mr. Greenspan again prepared to raise rates <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2004,</span> he incorporated the advice of Mr. Bernanke, an accomplished academic and then a Fed governor, who said that clearer guidance about the Fed’s goals and intentions could lead to more effective policy.
</span><span id=""50"" class=""red"">“Ambiguity has its uses, but mostly in noncooperative games like poker,” Mr. Bernanke told colleagues <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2003,</span> according to transcripts of a Fed policy meeting that year.</span> <span id=""51"" class=""red"">“Monetary policy is a cooperative game.</span> <span id=""52"" class=""red"">The whole point is to get financial markets on our side and for them to do some of our work for us.”
</span><span id=""53"" class=""red"">At their meeting next month, Fed officials will release new projections showing how much they expect to lift rates.</span> <span id=""54"" class=""red"">Thus far, their goal has been to raise them to “neutral,” a level that neither spurs nor slows growth, which officials estimate is <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2% and</span><span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3% when</span> inflation is near the Fed’<span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2% target</span>.</span> Unlike in recent years, and a departure from Mr. Bernanke’s guidance, how fast they get there and whether they go higher remain open questions.
<span id=""55"" class=""red"">Officials are hoping inflation declines as supply problems ease and demand shifts from goods, where prices rose sharply last year, toward services, where inflation has been less extreme.
</span>There’s plenty that could go wrong. <span id=""56"" class=""red"">Inflation might stay high because of factors outside of the Fed’s control, such as a Russian invasion of Ukraine that roils energy markets, or shipping delays made worse by pandemic-driven lockdowns in Asia.</span> <span id=""57"" class=""red"">And even if prices of goods moderate this year as expected, increases in wages and rents could keep inflation elevated <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">into 2023.</span>
</span><span id=""58"" class=""red"">Mr. Powell has for now declined to provide so-called forward guidance about the policy path because the inflation outlook is so uncertain.
</span><span id=""59"" class=""red"">The uncertainty over inflation and lack of Fed guidance is leading to greater volatility in bond markets.</span> Until last Thursday, officials played down the prospect of starting with a half-point rate increase or acting between regularly scheduled policy meetings.
<span id=""60"" class=""red"">“I prefer not to be deploying that kind of stuff if we can avoid it, and so far, I think we’ve got a smooth response to the inflation surprise,” said James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, in a Feb.<span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 7 interview</span>.
</span><span id=""61"" class=""red"">After Thursday’s report that inflation had climbed further to a 40-year high <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 7.5%,</span> Mr. Bullard changed his message, telling Bloomberg News that he would favor a bolder, half-point increase or an inter-meeting rate increase in the coming months.
</span><span id=""62"" class=""red"">His remarks accelerated the largest one-day jump in two-year Treasury bond yields <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2009 and</span> led futures markets to bet on a half-point increase next month.
</span>If Mr. Powell and his colleagues deliver such a move, they could be criticized for panicking. <span id=""63"" class=""red"">If he opts for the smaller increase, he could be criticized for not taking inflation seriously enough.
</span><span id=""64"" class=""red"">“Ideally, the Fed would come out and exert control of the policy message,” including by saying it will raise rates in a fashion that doesn’t inflame fears of an emergency, said Brian Sack, who ran the New York Fed’s markets desk <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 2009 to</span><span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012 and</span> is now the director of economics at hedge-fund manager D.E. Shaw.
</span><span id=""65"" class=""red"">Market speculation that the Fed might raise rates in between meetings, which intensified after Mr. Bullard’s remarks, fanned fears that policy isn’t well positioned to restrain the economy and bring down inflation, analysts said.
</span><span id=""66"" class=""red"">Complicating its deliberations, the Fed has more than one way of tightening policy by shrinking its bondholdings, which have more than doubled <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $9 trillion</span> since <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">March 2020.</span>
</span><span id=""67"" class=""red"">When the Fed shrank its holdings <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2017 and</span><span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2019,</span> it did so passively by allowing a certain amount of securities to mature without replacing them every month.</span> <span id=""68"" class=""red"">Some Fed officials, uncomfortable with having such a big presence in Treasurys, the world’s most important financial market, believe high inflation calls for a faster retreat by actively selling assets to raise longer-term rates.</span> <span id=""69"" class=""red"">Ms. George, the Kansas City Fed leader, and Mr. Rosengren advocate that more aggressive path.
</span><span id=""70"" class=""red"">Most Fed officials are cool to that, at least for now.</span> <span id=""71"" class=""red"">“When you’re adjusting policy substantially in other ways, introducing asset sales just complicates the path,” said Mr. Sack.</span> “There’s a risk of pouring fuel on the fire. The balance sheet is an instrument with still-uncertain effects, and you don’t want to push it too hard.”
<span id=""72"" class=""red"">For now, that also appears to be the predominant view at the Fed.</span> Mr. Powell said last month he wants the program to run in the background. <span id=""73"" class=""red"">It would function more like the rhythm section in a band, allowing the Fed to move its benchmark rate up or down if it wants to adjust policy.
</span>Looming over this is the reaction of the markets. Stocks, corporate bonds and real estate all reached historically high valuations in part on the assumption rates would remain very low for years. <span id=""74"" class=""red"">Though household borrowing as a share of U.S. gross domestic product is well below levels reached during the housing boom of 2004-06, corporate debt is near a record high.
</span><span id=""75"" class=""red"">“There are people who are living in a world in which an aggressive Fed tightening—an increasing possibility here—is not an outcome they can accept, so they’re pretending it won’t happen,” said Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at the investment firm Guggenheim Partners.</span> “The places where that’s very real—cryptocurrency, tech-related companies in private equity—could be in deep trouble.”
<span id=""76"" class=""red"">Once there’s a sharp decline in one of those sectors, that could set off volatility in other corners of the market, he said.

Is the Fed doing the right things to handle inflation?</span> Join the conversation below.
<span id=""78"" class=""red"">Mr. Rosengren said the prospect of a soft landing for the economy has diminished over the past six months because of more persistent supply shocks and workers winning higher wages to offset higher prices.
</span><span id=""79"" class=""red"">Rapidly raising rates to address the inflation problem increases the risks of a recession, he said.</span> <span id=""80"" class=""red"">“If you’re raising rates rapidly, you don’t have time to see how the rate increases you’ve already done have slowed down the economy,” he said.
</span><span id=""81"" class=""red"">One danger is that the Fed faces a bind where inflation only partially reverses its recent climb.</span> <span id=""82"" class=""red"">That would leave officials forced to choose between accepting a somewhat higher inflation rate or forcing unemployment to rise to higher levels, risking a downturn.

<span id=""84"" class=""red"">“You’re going to be a lot less popular” in that environment than the one the Fed was in during the past decade, said Mr. Dudley.

How Inflation Is Rising
Year-over-year changes in the Consumer Price Index
Prices climbed at the fastest pace in decades in the month leading up to the war in Ukraine, underlining the high stakes facing the United States — along with many developed economies — as the conflict promises to drive costs higher.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The Consumer Price Index rose <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 7.9 percent</span> through February, the fastest pace of annual inflation <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 40 years</span>.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Rising food and rent costs contributed to the big increase, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said, as did a nascent surge in gas prices that will become more pronounced in the March inflation report.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">The February report caught only the start of the surge in gas prices that came in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine late last month.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Economists expect inflation to pick up even more in March because prices at the pump have since jumped to record-breaking highs.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The average price for a gallon of gas <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was $4.32 on</span> Thursday, according to AAA.
</span>Rapidly climbing costs are hitting consumers in the pocketbook, causing confidence to fall and stretching household budgets. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Rising wages and savings amassed during the pandemic have helped many families continue spending despite rising prices, but the burden is falling most intensely on lower-income households, which devote a big chunk of their budgets to daily necessities that are now swiftly becoming more expensive.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The price burst presents a challenge for President Biden, especially given that November’s midterm elections are fast approaching.</span> Democrats will need to battle to retain control of Congress at a time when voters are feeling the squeeze of higher expenses. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">On Thursday, Mr. Biden acknowledged the pain consumers are feeling from rapid inflation but pointed a finger at President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, blaming his invasion of Ukraine for fueling higher gas prices.</span> Democrats tweeted about the report on Thursday using the hashtag #PutinPriceHike.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">“Today’s inflation report is a reminder that Americans’ budgets are being stretched by price increases and families are starting to feel the impacts of Putin’s price hike,” Mr. Biden said in a statement.</span> “As I have said from the start, there will be costs at home as we impose crippling sanctions in response to Putin’s unprovoked war, but Americans can know this: The costs we are imposing on Putin and his cronies are far more devastating than the costs we are facing.”
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">The Ukraine invasion is poised to compound a stubborn inflation problem.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Cost increases had been running fast for a year and accelerating for months, posing a problem for the Federal Reserve, which is in charge of achieving price stability.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">The central bank has signaled it will raise interest rates by a quarter percentage point at its meeting next week, probably the first in a series of moves meant to increase the cost of borrowing and spending money and slow down the economy.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">By reducing consumption and slowing the labor market, the Fed is able to take some pressure off inflation over time.

Year-over-year change in vehicle categories of the Consumer Price Index
Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen on Thursday predicted more inflation ahead as a result of Russia’s invasion and the economic sanctions Western countries have placed on Mr. Putin’s regime.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">“We’ve seen a very meaningful increase in gas prices,” Ms. Yellen said on CNBC.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">“And my guess is that next month we’ll see a further evidence of an impact on U.S. inflation of Putin’s war on Ukraine.”
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">The gas shock is just the latest instance in which what can go wrong seems to be going wrong when it comes to prices.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">Fast inflation began to kick in early last year, and many forecasters initially predicted that it would fade by the end <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2021 as</span> the economy reopened from the pandemic and conditions returned to normal.
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">Instead, turmoil in supply chains collided with strong consumer demand for goods, and price gains accelerated.</span> <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Now, it is hard to guess how quickly and how much prices will moderate <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2022 as</span> conflict abroad threatens to keep shipping routes tangled and parts scarce.</span> <span id=""32"" class=""red"">Ukraine is an important producer of neon, which could keep computer chips in short supply, perpetuating the shortages that have plagued automakers.</span> Higher energy costs could ricochet through other industries.
<span id=""33"" class=""red"">Even without further supply chain troubles, there are signs that inflation is widening beyond a few pandemic-affected sectors, an indication that they could last as the latest virus surge fades from view.</span> Rent of primary residences, for instance, climbed <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 0.6 percent</span> from the prior month — the fastest monthly pace of growth <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1999.</span>
<span id=""34"" class=""red"">Price gains have been rapid around much of the world, causing many central banks to scale back how much help they are providing to their economies.</span> <span id=""35"" class=""red"">The European Central Bank on Thursday decided to speed up its exit from its bond-buying program as it tries to counter rising inflation.</span> <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Europe’s push to end its energy dependence on Russia promises to raise costs at a time when inflation is already nearly triple the central bank’s target.
</span><span id=""37"" class=""red"">In the United States, there are still reasons to think price gains will slow his year.</span> Beginning in March, the data will be compared to relatively high readings from last year, which should mechanically start to bring down the year-over-year measure. <span id=""38"" class=""red"">But it is unclear when inflation will recede to the Fed’<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2 percent</span> inflation goal.</span> <span id=""39"" class=""red"">The central bank defines that target using a separate inflation index, but one that is also up considerably.

</span><span id=""44"" class=""red"">What is inflation?</span> <span id=""45"" class=""red"">Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today.</span> <span id=""46"" class=""red"">It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys.
</span>“I used to go on relaxing drives,” he said, but now joy rides are unaffordable. <span id=""47"" class=""red"">“I’m on a shoestring budget, and I work pretty hard.</span> For anyone who doesn’t make a lot of money, you have to be intelligent and start cutting corners.”
<span id=""48"" class=""red"">As it disturbs everyday lives, inflation is likely to dog Democrats and the administration as they fight to retain control of Congress in November.</span> <span id=""49"" class=""red"">Despite plentiful jobs and quickly rising wages, consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest level since the summer <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2011,</span> when the economy was clambering back from the global financial crisis and Congress was bickering over lifting the nation’s debt ceiling.
</span><span id=""50"" class=""red"">That probably at least partly reflects the reality that pay is not quite keeping up with inflation for the typical worker, and that consumers are paying more at the pump, which tends to be a very salient cost for Americans.
</span><span id=""51"" class=""red"">In February, the cost of food rose, which is also difficult for consumers on tight budgets.</span> <span id=""52"" class=""red"">Over the past year, grocery prices have increased <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 8.6 percent</span>, the largest yearly jump since the period ending in <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 1981.</span></span> Fresh fruit and dairy products became notably more expensive last month.
<span id=""53"" class=""red"">Higher Costs for Food and Rent
Year-over-year changes in select categories of the Consumer Price Index
The White House has emphasized that it is trying to offset rising costs to the degree that it can.
</span><span id=""54"" class=""red"">“We’ve taken steps to address bottlenecks in the supply chain, to reduce those bottlenecks,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said this week.
</span><span id=""55"" class=""red"">But those changes have mostly helped around the edges, and as prices have shown little sign of moderating on their own, Fed officials have coalesced around the view that they will need to use their policies to cool off demand and keep today’s rapid inflation from becoming entrenched.</span> <span id=""56"" class=""red"">That may limit the central bank’s room to react to any slowdown in growth prompted by uncertainty and high gas prices.
</span>“They need to stay on track,” said Ms. Rosner-Warburton. <span id=""57"" class=""red"">“They don’t have as much leeway to respond to these risks, given how elevated inflation is.”

PM Pedro Sánchez's party <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">polled 29% and</span> will need the help of either left-wing Podemos and regional parties, or the centre right, to form a government.
Far-right party Vox also won seats - the first time a significant far-right force has done so in decades.
Vox opposes multiculturalism, unrestricted migration, and what it calls ""radical feminism"".
Analysts say support for Vox has been boosted by widespread anger at separatists in the province of Catalonia, who want independence from Spain. Vox fervently opposes any concessions to the secessionists.
The other big story of the election was the collapse in support for the conservative Popular Party (PP), which governed Spain until it was dumped from power in <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">May 2018 in</span> a no-confidence vote.
In its worst election ever, the PP won <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 66 seats</span>, down <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 137 in</span> the previous parliament.
Turnout <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 75.8%,</span> the highest for several years <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 9% more</span> than the previous election <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span></span>
In his victory speech, Mr Sánchez said the party's big challenges were to fight inequality, advance co-existence and halt corruption.
""The future has won and the past has lost,"" he told cheering supporters. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">During his time in office he has raised the minimum wage, appointed a female-dominated cabinet and promised to strengthen rape laws, defining it as sex without clear consent.
</span>The result is a personal success for the prime minister, who increased his party's share <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 23% of</span> the vote <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span></span>
But it still leaves the Socialists and <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Podemos 11 seats</span> short of the <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">necessary 176 for</span> a majority in the 350-seat parliament.
Mr Sánchez must now look for support from the smaller parties or from the centre right.
An alliance with centre-right Ciudadanos (57 seats) would give him the numbers, but its leader, Albert Rivera, was bitterly critical of Mr Sánchez's collaboration with Catalan separatists, referring to his earlier ""Frankenstein government"" – and vowed he would not enter a coalition with the Socialists.
And as Mr Sánchez gave his victory speech late on Sunday, supporters chanted ""Not with Rivera!"", making it clear they also did not want a coalition with Ciudadanos.
The head of previous coalition partner Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, made clear on Sunday night that another left-wing administration was possible.
But the results appear to make any left-coalition dependent on Catalan pro-independence parties, which opponents on the right see as toxic.
An alliance involving all the other regional parties, including the Basque separatist PNV, would leave him one seat short of a majority.
All parties are now looking towards the regional and European elections in less than a month.

Who are Vox?
The PP's historic defeat means that, even with the support of Ciudadanos (Citizens) and Vox, it has no chance of forming a right-wing coalition, and leader Pablo Casado said it would become the main opposition force.
But Vox saw its support surge, winning more <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10% of</span> the vote, which gives <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">it 24 seats</span>.
It received congratulations from other right-wing leaders, including Italy's deputy PM Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen, leader of the French far-right National Rally.
Vox's success is seen as a turning point for the far-right, who have not won seats in parliament since the death of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1975 and</span> the restoration of democracy – with the sole exception of a single seat for Blas Piñar in the first parliament of 1979–1982.
Led by Santiago Abascal, a former PP member, the party has emerged in a matter of months with a vow to ""make Spain great again"".
In his speech after the results, Mr Abascal said: ""We told you that we were starting a reconquest of Spain and that is exactly what we have done... and we can clearly say to all of Spain that Vox is here to stay.""
Vox rejects the far-right label but its views on immigration and Islam place it in line with far-right and populist parties elsewhere in Europe.
It wants to repeal laws against gender violence, and opposes abortion and same-sex marriage. Critics see it as a nationalist throwback to the Franco era.
Vox aims to deport migrants legally entitled to be in Spain if they have committed an offence, and wants to prevent any migrant who comes in illegally from staying.
Why is Catalonia so important?
The future of Spain's semi-autonomous north-eastern region was one of the big issues of the election.",0,,,,,2,,,,0,,,,,,1,

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 19,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016

MUMBAI</span>—Foes of Indian central bank Gov. Raghuram Rajan cheered his weekend decision to step down at the end of his term in September, as investors watched closely to see who would succeed him.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">In a letter posted on the Reserve Bank of India website on Saturday, Mr. Rajan, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, said he had been open to staying in his job, but that after “consultations with the government” had decided to return to academia.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Investors will be watching closely to see who Prime Minister Narendra Modi chooses as a successor and whether Mr. Rajan’s departure is a harbinger of a shift toward a less liberal stance on economic policies by an administration that has sought to boost growth.

</span>Mr. Rajan’s exit “will add a new dimension of uncertainty” to Indian markets, said Praveen Jagwani, chief executive of money manager UTI International (Singapore) Pvt. Ltd. “Global investors could get irrationally spooked by his exit.”

<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The 53-year-old Mr. Rajan, who had spent much of his career at the University of Chicago before joining the Indian government as an adviser <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> won plaudits from economists for boosting the independence of the central bank and focusing on curbing India’s chronically high inflation.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">But those same traits at times put him at odds with some members of Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, which has deep roots in Hindu nationalism, who questioned his patriotism and lambasted him for not moving more quickly to cut interest rates.

</span>A tweet from one of Mr. Rajan’s most outspoken critics, Subramanian Swamy, a BJP member of parliament, said of Mr. Rajan: “Whatever fig leaf he wants for hiding the reality we should not grudge it. Say goodbye!” <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Mr. Swamy, who has accused Mr. Rajan of attempting “to wreck the Indian economy,” said Mr. Rajan’s leaving was a credit to Mr. Modi.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Another prominent Hindu-nationalist voice, S. Gurumurthy, who has campaigned for Indian economic self-sufficiency, tweeted: “Nothing personal against Rajan.</span> Only point is he knows very little re India. He’s a Global Indian.”

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Such rhetoric underscores the friction within the BJP and the broader Hindu-nationalist movement between a wing that supports more orthodox, liberal economic policies and those with deeper suspicions of markets and capitalism who have a more protectionist bent.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">“This reflects a broad sense of unease about Mr. Rajan” in Mr. Modi’s party, said T.T. Ram Mohan, who teaches finance at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">“They feel they need to take a fresh look at what’s been done.”

Mr. Modi has retreated from some federal initiatives, such as revamping labor laws and making land acquisition for development easier, in the face of opposition internally and externally, BJP politicians say.

</span>In an interview with The Wall Street Journal last month, Mr. Modi, when asked if he would reappoint Mr. Rajan, responded: “I don’t think this administrative subject can be an issue for the media. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">And that issue is only in September, not now.”

Mr. Rajan’s often analytical view of the state of the Indian economy and his assessments of government policies at times seemed out of step with the government’s efforts to tout its successes.

</span>“The BJP now wants someone who is more cohesively with the government, because they have a limited window of opportunity to do what they promised,” said Harsh Pant, a South Asia specialist at King’s College in London.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">India is now the fastest-growing major economy in the world, since a revision in the way it calculates its gross domestic product, and Mr. Modi and other national leaders cite that ranking repeatedly in speeches at home and abroad.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">In April, Mr. Rajan said that despite the apparently rapid expansion, India’s economy was still recovering, and that he saw little room for self-congratulation.</span> “I think we have still to get to a place where we feel satisfied. We have this saying—‘In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.’ We are a little bit that way,” Mr. Rajan said.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Foreign Trade Minister Nirmala Sitharaman criticized the governor’s choice of words and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said India’s growth rate called for “a celebration.”

</span>Mr. Rajan later said he meant that India’s performance was happening at a time of global weakness. “We cannot get carried away by our own superior growth rate,” he said.

The governor has also sounded a note of caution on other major government initiatives.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">In <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">December 2014,</span> a few weeks after the launch of Mr. Modi’s “Make in India” program aimed at developing manufacturing, Mr. Rajan said an export-led growth strategy might not work as well for India as it did for other Asian economies such as China.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Due to the tepid global economic recovery, especially in industrial countries, he said, Indian companies might want to focus on making for India.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">When the government touted the opening of a record number of bank accounts for poor people in a major financial-inclusion program, Mr. Rajan cautioned against calling it an easy victory.

</span>“We have to make sure it does not go off the track,” Mr. Rajan said. “The target is universality, not just speed and numbers.”

He also used his bully pulpit to call for tolerance and an open exchange of ideas at a time when Mr. Modi’s administration was facing criticism on those fronts from political opponents.

The governor irked other powerful interests in India.

<span id=""16"" class=""red"">His plan to force banks to come clean about the extent of nonperforming loans on their books has put some of India’s largest conglomerates under pressure to keep up with debt payment.

</span>“It’s a big victory for the crony capitalists, unless the government appoints someone with immense credibility as next RBI governor,” said Rahul Bhasin, managing partner of money manager Baring Equity Partners (India) Pvt.

65c7cc028f76694c5125d22b,41333,"<h3>Many Countries See The Pandemic As A Crisis. Authoritarians Spot An Opportunity.</h3>At first glance, Venezuela looks like one of the world’s biggest coronavirus success stories. Amid rampant worries in the pandemic’s earliest stages that COVID-19 would overwhelm the crisis-stricken state, socialist President Nicolás Maduro locked down the country and seemingly stopped the spread. As of Monday, Venezuelan authorities had reported just more <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 20,000 cases</span> <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 174 deaths</span>, among the lowest numbers in Latin America ― a region the virus has hit harder than any other.
For months, though, there have been abundant signs that the situation is actually very dire. Doctors have reported that case numbers are far higher than the government asserts and that the country’s beleaguered health system is on the brink of collapse. Journalists have reported their own, higher figures, or shown up outside hospitals to observe the situation for themselves.
Maduro has reacted with a crackdown against anyone who may expose the state’s faults. In imprisoning doctors and journalists, he joins a roster of authoritarian leaders who have sought to cover up their own inadequacies and failing responses to the pandemic through censorship and repression.
“They don’t want anybody giving alternative numbers. They want to keep control of the message,” said Phil Gunson, a Venezuela-based researcher at the International Crisis Group, an NGO. “There hasn’t really been a comprehensive response [in Venezuela] ― all we’ve had is propaganda.”
Globally, the world’s most authoritarian governments, in Venezuela and Nicaragua, Egypt, China and elsewhere, have treated the pandemic similarly: By using it as cover to broaden and intensify their efforts to clamp down on dissent and thwart the free spread of information — and not just about the pandemic.
For authoritarian governments, the coronavirus outbreak has provided an opening to target some of the last remaining freedoms in their countries, and in Maduro’s case, it has sapped an opposition seeking to oust him of any remaining momentum it had. In other nations, meanwhile, the virus has presented an opportunity for aspiring authoritarians to act on their most autocratic whims.
That approach isn’t just a threat to democratic norms and human rights ― it has likely also further obscured the true scope of the global pandemic and made it harder for health experts to adequately respond to it.
“The countries that are taking these measures are making it difficult to effectively control the epidemic,” said Domingos Alves, a professor of social medicine at the University of São Paulo in Brazil. “And they may, from now on, be the effective cause of a worsening of this epidemic in other countries in the coming months.”
Silencing Reporters And Doctors
During a mid-May campaign stop, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that the public health problem wasn’t the coronavirus itself, but that testing was finding too many cases of it.
“When you test, you have a case,” Trump said. “When you test, you find something is wrong with people. If we didn’t do any testing we would have very few cases.”
He was roundly mocked for the absurdity of the statement, but a lack of testing has proved a key way for governments to limit the collection of coronavirus data.
Venezuela, which was credited for its aggressive early response to the virus, has closed all but two official testing sites and prevented private labs from conducting their own exams.
In Nicaragua, where President Daniel Ortega largely denied the existence of the virus, civil society organizations have suggested that the country’s relatively low counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths are due to a lack of testing and the government’s deliberate attempts to obscure data: “There are reasons to believe” the official estimates are “far lower than the actual number” of infections and deaths, said Tiziano Breda, a Guatemala-based Central America analyst for the International Crisis Group.
In the pandemic’s earliest stages, China’s efforts to control its data ― which included the suppression of medical experts and a crackdown on reporting ― robbed international health organizations and governments of valuable information and time they could have used to prepare for outbreaks. Whistleblower Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist, died of COVID-19 months after authorities silenced his warnings. And social media discussion of the virus is censored in China, where the government has expelled foreign journalists exposing the dark reality of the crisis.
Those repressive practices have spread alongside the virus. Venezuelan authorities arrested a journalist for reporting alternative coronavirus figures in March, just days after confirming the country’s first case. The Committee to Protect Journalists has said at <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 10 reporters</span> were arrested in the country between late March and early May.
“If you’re a journalist ... and you’re in the vicinity of a hospital and you look like you’re reporting, you risk getting picked up and held and your material taken, and you may get roughed up,” Gunson said. “You may get a call in the middle of the night from the secret police and get disappeared for a few days, and then charged with offenses under what’s called the law against hate.”
Cambodia jailed a journalist simply for quoting the prime minister, while Thailand has criminalized reporting that authorities deem to be “false” news about coronavirus. Police in India have arrested and harassed members of the press who have written critical stories, and the government has reportedly pressured media outlets to publish positive stories about its coronavirus response. <span id=""0"" class=""red"">In Zimbabwe, journalists have gone into hiding to avoid reprisal from the government: “I am hiding like a rat in my own country for doing nothing more than my job,” one Zimbabwean reporter told The Associated Press this week.
</span>There is sort of an open war against doctors and health care workers who try to voice an independent opinion or complain about the lack of equipment or training. Amr Magdi, Human Rights Watch expert on the Middle East and North Africa
Medical workers have also become an increasingly prominent target of authoritarians: In June, Egyptian authorities arrested Alaa Shaaban Hamida, a pregnant 26-year-old doctor, at her office and charged her with terrorism offenses and “spreading false news” after a nurse used Hamida’s phone to report a coronavirus case directly to the Health Ministry instead of telling her managers. At least a dozen other health care workers and journalists have been held on draconian charges.
The Egyptian government has failed to provide protective equipment and shares questionable information about the scale of the crisis, and rights groups say the country’s outbreak is almost certainly worse than official figures suggest. But President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly have publicly criticized physicians for not containing the virus, and when the country’s largest doctors’ organization planned a press conference to object to the accusations, rights groups say security forces seized the organization’s headquarters to silence them.
“There is sort of an open war against doctors and health care workers who try to voice an independent opinion or complain about the lack of equipment or training,” said Amr Magdi, a Middle East and North Africa expert at Human Rights Watch.
In Russia, infectious disease experts have faced intimidation after questioning whether the government is manipulating statistics and death tolls. And while Venezuelan doctors questioned the Maduro government’s official data early in the summer, health officials now “are very, very careful not to give alternative numbers,” Gunson said.
“It’s been made absolutely clear to them,” Gunson said, “that they will be treated very severely.”
Medical professionals in Nicaragua have repeatedly pushed back against Ortega’s handling of the pandemic: In a May letter, more <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 700 doctors</span> warned that “the deliberate concealment and manipulation of the actual number of people affected” had prevented Nicaragua from implementing “appropriate epidemiological measures of containment and mitigation.”
Ortega’s government has also faced criticism from human rights groups that have accused his government of purposefully obscuring the number of COVID-19 cases by classifying deaths as a result of pneumonia or other common respiratory illnesses, and for holding “express burials” in the middle of the night.
As of last week, at <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 21 Nicaraguan</span> doctors had been fired for disputing the government’s official line on the virus, The Wall Street Journal reported.
The targeting of reporters and doctors is part of broader human rights crackdowns: Turkey’s government reportedly arrested hundreds of people over social media posts, offering only vague explanations for their offenses, while it also detained numerous journalists for reporting on the virus. Zimbabwean human rights groups said the government arrested more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 60 people</span> after a protest this weekend. And between the end of March and early June, the Venezuelan nonprofit Center for Justice and Peace documented at <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 184 </span>“systematic human rights violations” under Maduro.
The Rise Of New Authoritarians
In many of these countries, the attacks on dissent and the limiting of official data are continuations of long-standing practices: The Venezuelan government hasn’t published epidemiological data for the last five years, Gunson said.
“We’re in a black hole in terms of official statistics,” he said. “It’s not that they’re just suppressing information about COVID-19. They are across the board suppressing information.”
Ortega’s government in Nicaragua has for years limited access to official figures on homicides and other vital public information, and his actions during the pandemic are almost indistinguishable from the sort of repression that drew international attention in <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2018,</span> when mass protests broke out against his government in Managua, the capital city.
“The repression, the crackdowns and the threats against journalists have been basically constant since the outbreak of the <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 2018 crisis</span>,” Breda said. “The topic now has shifted: We’re talking less about civil liberties and the right to protest, or the narrowing of the democratic state. Now it’s all centered around information related to COVID-19. So the topic is a shift, but the practice has remained the same.”
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Trump has sought to bring down Maduro and, to a lesser extent, Ortega, since the beginning of his presidency, and has implemented brutal economic sanctions against both governments that he has refused to relax during the pandemic, further complicating both nations’ approach to the virus.</span> The pandemic, however, has given a new model of authoritarians ― including Trump himself and far-right Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro ― the opportunity to act on their most autocratic and conspiratorial desires, and they have adopted many of the same practices as Ortega and Maduro, two men they ostensibly oppose.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The U.S. and Brazil rank first and second, respectively, on the list of largest coronavirus outbreaks, but a lack of reliable testing ― and their presidents’ lack of interest in facilitating it ― has likely obscured the true scope of the pandemic in both nations.
</span>Alves, of the University of São Paulo, authored a study in April that showed Brazil’s outbreak was likely at <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">least 12 times</span> larger than official figures showed, while the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the actual number of infections in the U.S. is likely anywhere from six <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 24 times</span> the confirmed total.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Trump and Bolsonaro have both dismissed rising death counts, politicized the use of masks and falsely framed efforts to control the virus’ spread as motivated attempts to crater their economies and bring down their governments.
</span>Bolsonaro and Trump have each faced accusations of trying to block the public from accessing coronavirus-related data on government websites. They have both used the pandemic to undermine faith in the press and democratic institutions. And the two right-wing leaders, who are friendly with each other, have targeted top public health experts for offering dissenting views, either by firing them, driving them to quit or essentially sidelining them.
Trump has responded to his declining popularity with an authoritarian response to racial justice protests, while Bolsonaro has tried to expand his influence over Brazil’s impartial institutions, including its law enforcement and judicial bodies. Before he tested positive in early July, Bolsonaro appeared at small, weekly protests where some supporters called on him to close Brazil’s national Congress.
Other leaders have gone even farther than Trump and Bolsonaro. Hungary, for example, passed measures that allowed far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban to effectively rule by decree for months, a time he used to undercut opposition parties.
In Bolivia, far-right evangelical leader Jeanine Añez, who took control after an effective coup against former socialist President Evo Morales, has used the outbreak to strengthen her grip on power, which was cemented with rampant human rights abuses. Bolivia’s electoral court twice delayed presidential elections early in the pandemic, allowing Añez, a supposedly temporary leader who is running despite promising not to, to remain in power even longer. In late July, the country’s top electoral court pushed the presidential vote back again, raising concerns about the future of a democracy that has been on the brink for months.
Under Añez, who is trailing in election polls, “state-sponsored violence, restrictions on free speech, and arbitrary detentions have all contributed to a climate of fear and misinformation that has undermined the rule of law as well as the prospects of fair and open elections,” a Harvard Law School report released last week said.
Ecuadorian President Lenín Moreno, meanwhile, decried criticism of his government’s slow response to the pandemic as “fake news,” even as The New York Times reported that the country’s death toll was <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 15 times</span> higher than the government’s official figures suggested. In July, a major Ecuadorian opposition party led by former President Rafael Correa was suspended from <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2021 elections</span> in a move prominent regional leaders called an “act of political bias” that “calls into question the legitimacy” of the upcoming contests. (A court recently reinstated the party.)
And in Guatemala, President Alejandro Giammattei, who human rights activists feared would cement the country’s turn away from democracy when he won election last year, has taken advantage of pandemic-era lockdowns to further weaken the country’s democratic institutions.
Giammattei, a doctor and former police officer, initially responded with strong measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including a curfew. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">But in recent weeks, it has become “really obvious that the curfew is a way of controlling social unrest,” especially as rising poverty rates and anger over government corruption threaten to bring Guatemalans back into the streets, said Frank La Rue, a Guatemalan human rights expert and the president of the Central American Institute for the Study of Social Democracy.
</span>The majority coalition in Guatemalan Congress, which includes Giammattei’s party, has also attempted to undermine the country’s supreme and constitutional courts during the pandemic as it continues to roll back efforts to combat institutionalized corruption in a country where major parties have long been linked to organized crime.
“Guatemala is a tragedy moving from bad to worse,” La Rue said of his native country, although his warning seemingly applies to countless other nations across the globe.
“The pandemic,” he added, “has been the perfect cover to take a more authoritarian approach to things.”",,1,,,3,,,,,,4,5,,,,,

Sept.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 17,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2013 4</span>:32 pm ET

Institutional investors in Western European property are getting bolder in their hunt for higher returns, testing new locations and asset classes.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Investors have been buying property in secondary cities and seeking prime real estate in the best locations in economically struggling European countries that, a year ago, were left to the most adventurous.

</span>The volume of European commercial property deals in the first half of the year reached €66.3 billion ($88.4 billion), making it the strongest first half <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008,</span> according to property advisory firm Cushman & Wakefield. The consultancy said this was, in part, because investors have broadened their criteria.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">While the focus on prime office or retail space hasn't disappeared, investors are now showing increased interest in car showrooms, health-care properties, logistics space, student housing, regional retailing and budget hotels.

</span>For example, at the end of August, Legal & General Property acquired a portfolio of nine car showrooms in the U.K. on behalf of its UK Property Trust, which were <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">yielding 6.33% at</span> the time of the deal. The £40 million ($63.6 million) deal was the U.K. fund manager's largest in the sector to date. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">It owns four other car showrooms in the U.K.

Legal & General Property also completed several deals in the student-housing sector this year and is looking for investments in the health-care sector.</span> Parent company Legal & General Group PLC moved into house-building for the first time with its March acquisition of <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 46.5% stake</span> in CALA Group.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Simon Marrison, European chief executive officer at LaSalle Investment Management, says regional retail in the U.K. has become increasingly attractive to his firm.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">""It's not glamorous retail; it's necessity retail, where you have a poorer catchment [area]—one that doesn't necessarily have a computer at home, so you're not competing with online retail and a group that doesn't have a lot to do during the day,"" he says.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The volume of European retail-sector property deals rose more <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30% year</span>-on-year to €16 billion in the first half of the year, according to Cushman & Wakefield.

</span>""There's definitely a trend where [investors] are going up the risk curve in terms of the type of assets or going into more regional cities,"" says Stefan Wundrak, director of property research at Henderson Global Investors Ltd.

Among the secondary cities that have seen an increase in the value of deals completed in the first half of this year, compared with the same period <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2012,</span> are Hamburg and Hanover in Germany; Lyon and Nice in France; and Leeds, Milton Keynes and Liverpool in the U.K., according to data from Cushman & Wakefield and Real Capital Analytics.

Investors point to the higher yields available for assets in those markets. Higher yields can represent a perception of greater risk.

For example, the average yield on prime offices in smaller U.K. cities is <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 6.25% compared</span> <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 4% in</span> London, according to estimates from consultancy Jones Lang LaSalle.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">In France, prime office yields in Lyon <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">are 5.65%,</span> compared <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with 4.5% in</span> Paris, a more crowded market.

</span>Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management said in a note to clients this month: ""We stress at this juncture that the window for taking advantage of secondary locations in North-Western Europe will not remain open indefinitely.""

Rob Martin, director of research at Legal & General Property, said that since the beginning <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2010,</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 70% of</span> the firm's purchases have been outside London. But he warned that investors need to be selective when dealing in markets with which they aren't familiar.

And not all regional markets are created equal. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Some are home to aging properties or don't have the demographics to sustain a recovery that will support property market growth.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">""Where I would be hesitant—and this is a strategy some will go for—is buying effectively tertiary stock [assets in very remote locations] on the expectation that yields across the whole market will compress,"" Mr. Martin says.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">""Even in a recovering economy, I think there are some spaces that will become obsolete and that will still be painful to have,"" such as older shopping centers in areas where there are newer and more desirable counterparts for people to visit.

</span>The real-estate investment units of two large insurers ventured back into Spain and Italy this year, in a sign that large fund managers are becoming more comfortable shopping for deals there.

Axa Real Estate bought a portfolio <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 13 buildings</span> in Barcelona from the Catalan government for €172 million in June, marking its first Spanish deal <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2008.</span> It also bought two office buildings in Milan that month. Allianz Real Estate invested in two office buildings, one in Milan and one in Rome, during the summer.

Prime office yields in Milan <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">are 5.1% in</span> Milan <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 5.3% in</span> Rome, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, while prime office yields <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">are 6.75% in</span> Barcelona <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 6.2% in</span> Madrid.

Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management said in the research note that it had added investments in ""prime Eurozone periphery markets"" to its recommendations for the coming year, adding that investors prepared to take on additional risk should begin plotting their return to the strongest markets in Italy and Spain <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2015.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The firm tipped Italian retail to outperform its Spanish counterpart, but highlighted Madrid's office market as one it expected to outperform relative to others in Europe's more fiscally troubled areas.

WASHINGTON—President Trump ramped up pressure on Democrats to end an impasse over funding for a border wall, formally inviting them to a bipartisan meeting at the White House on Wednesday amid a partial government shutdown.

Democratic congressional leaders said late Tuesday they would take part in the Wednesday meeting, slated to take place <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 3 p</span>.m. But they are unlikely to offer any compromises at the session, as their leverage stands to grow a day later, when the party officially takes control of the House and Rep.

With the shutdown now in its second week, Mr. Trump has been looking to cast Democrats as unwilling to negotiate, highlighting his decision to forgo a vacation and stay in the White House.

“I’m in the Oval Office,” the president tweeted on Monday. “Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the Wall.”

With neither side talking to each other directly, a meeting would bring them face-to-face, though they remain split over the central issue that triggered the shutdown: Funding for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.

Mr. Trump has insisted that he won’t sign a measure reopening the government unless he gets money for the wall, while Democrats remain staunchly opposed. A border wall was Mr. Trump’s signature campaign promise—and his progress in building one figures to be an issue in <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 2020 presidential</span> race.

Mr. Trump’s invitation, issued on New Year’s Day, went to the top eight Republican and Democratic leaders in both the House and Senate.

The meeting, if it takes place, is expected to include a briefing on border security from the Department of Homeland Security, a congressional aide said.

Aides to Mrs. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), said late Tuesday afternoon that planned to attend.

Outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.)—whose last official day in power is Wednesday—won’t attend. Incoming House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California plans to go, as does incoming GOP Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.), aides said. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also plans to attend the meeting.

In recent tweets, Mr. Trump has sought to coax Democrats to the negotiating table, while portraying their opposition to wall funding as an irresponsible acceptance of what he called “open borders.”

“Border Security and the Wall ‘thing’ and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker!” Mr. Trump tweeted on Tuesday. “Let’s make a deal?”

Recent attempts to reach a breakthrough and reopen the government have gone nowhere.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), a Trump ally, had lunch with the president at the White House on Sunday and laid out a plan that would couple border wall spending with new protections for undocumented immigrants, known as “Dreamers,” who were brought to the U.S. when they were young. The plan was aimed at picking up Democratic votes. Though Mr. Graham said that the president voiced openness toward the proposal, congressional Democratic officials expressed skepticism that something as complex as the status of Dreamers could be resolved in the current round of talks.

Meantime, House Democrats say they plan to push to reopen the government when they take control of the chamber on Thursday with a package of six spending bills that would fund most of the government through September. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">They will also put forward a separate bill that would fund the Department of Homeland Security until Feb.<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 8,</span> without the border wall money that Mr. Trump seeks to put in that agency’s budget.

</span>Democrats say that would allow the government to reopen quickly, while still leaving the door open for a debate on the wall. They also note Senate Republicans backed just such a package last month, a deal that was rejected by Mr. Trump and Republicans in the House.

“It would be the height of irresponsibility and political cynicism for Senate Republicans to now reject the same legislation they have already supported,” Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Pelosi said in a joint statement earlier this week.

But the president balked at the idea, tweeting, “The Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security—and our Country must finally have a Strong and Secure Southern Border!”

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, in a statement late Tuesday night, said the Democrats’ plan is unacceptable.

“The Pelosi plan is a non-starter because it does not fund our homeland security or keep American families safe from human trafficking, drugs, and crime,” she said.

65c7cc028f76694c5125d22b,20542,"<h3>Scott Walker's Big and Bold Iowa Address</h3>Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker eschewed the podium at Saturday’s Iowa Freedom Summit, opting to use the full stage to work the room with an incredibly high-energy speech that repeatedly stressed the themes of “common sense conservative reform” and the GOP’s need to “go big and go bold” if they want to win in American politics today.
Walker ended by telling Iowans, “I’m going to come back many more times in the future” and pointed to a broader American revival similar to the one he said he’s led in Wisconsin. This seemed to be a clear sign that Walker intends to aggressively pursue the GOP nomination <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span></span>
Striking a mostly populist pose, Walker began his speech by thanking individuals for helping him to take on “big money Washington,” special interests, and unions in Wisconsin. He also thanked people on behalf of both himself and his wife for their prayers, citing the support they both felt as they endured protests and death threats for pursuing his political agenda in Wisconsin.
Occupy Wall Street began in Wisconsin, said Walker, adding that the threat that bothered him the most was one that said they were going to “gut his wife” like a deer.
That portion of Walker’s message appeared designed to make the case that he’d have the strength and drive to stay the course, however difficult, should he opt to run for the presidency <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2016.</span></span> <span id=""0"" class=""red"">From there, Walker shifted to economics.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Citing Wisconsin’s debt and tax situation before his reforms, Walker insisted he wasn’t afraid to go “big and bold,” adding that people in Wisconsin are growing up in a state better than the one in which he was first elected.</span> Walker claimed that Wisconsin is the only state in America that can say that today, noting that he was re-elected three times in a state that trends Democrat.
More than once, Walker returned to “Go big, go bold!” and “common sense conservative reform” as the signature themes of his speech. Insisting he took the power away from the special interests in Wisconsin and put it back in the hands of the people, Walker also said his success in Wisconsin demonstrates that “common sense conservative reforms work,” and if they can work in Wisconsin, they can work “anywhere in the country”
He also talked about education, saying that Wisconsin can now hire the best teachers available because of his education reforms. Walker cited the state’s ability to pay based upon performance and hire and fire upon performance, not tenure, as the cornerstones of that success.
Briefly defining an agenda based upon his Wisconsin experience , Walker cited pro-life legislation, defunding planned parenthood, pulling back excessive government regulations, and enforcing “common sense” not “bureaucratic red tape” in government. He also cited cutting down on frivolous lawsuits and allowing for concealed carry and “castle doctrine” so citizens can stand up and defend their property.
Walker was met with broad applause several times, notably when mentioning requiring a photo ID to vote to preserve election integrity as another part of his agenda. Obama and Obamacare also rated a mention, with Walker pointing out he fought Obamacare in court and his intention to fight “Obama’s executive overreach” in court going forward.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">He also cited what he termed “big and bold” tax cuts that reduced taxes <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by $2 billion</span> in Wisconsin.</span> Walker said Wisconsin property taxes are lower today than they were four years ago, and he’s going to keep lowering them. It’s “people’s money not the government’s money,” said Walker — contrasting the “Wisconsin way” with the “Washington way.”
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Walker ended his speech by focusing on his youth and family, citing his first job at a restaurant to support himself while in school.</span> Growing up, “We were kind of poor,” he said, adding that he had to work hard but wouldn’t have it any other way, voicing support for “policies that support and defend hard work,” while promoting policies that contoinue to “open the door of opportunity” in America.
“I never had a young classmate say they wanted to become dependent on American government when they grew up,” said Walker, calling America one of few places left in the world where it doesn’t matter what circumstances you were born into, as “the outcome is up to everyone individually. We celebrate the 4th of July not the 15th of April,” he added.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The governor called for leaders in Washington who understand it’s not important to build the economy of Washington, but to build it in states and towns across the country.</span> He also briefly addressed foreign policy by saying, “We need leaders that understand when freedom-loving people anywhere are under attack, we need to stand with them.” Walker used the phrase “radical Islamic terrorists,” a move likely meant to draw a contrast between him and Obama, who recently said he doesn’t like the term “radical Islam.”
Near the end of his address, before saying he’d be back to Iowa many times, Walker said, “The measure of success for government should not be how many people depend upon it, but how many are no are longer dependent on it”.",0,,,,,2,,,,0,,,,0,,,
65c7cc028f76694c5125d22b,17786,"<h3>The Shale Boom’s New Winner: Propane</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">U.S. exports account for more than a third of the overall market for waterborne shipments of the fuel

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 2,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2016 9</span>:03 am ET

The U.S. is exporting record volumes of propane, another way in which the shale boom has made the nation a more dominant force in the global energy trade.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Foreign sales are surging as U.S. producers capitalize on higher prices overseas.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">That in turn is causing U.S. prices to rise, making Fourth of July barbecues a bit more expensive than cookouts a few months ago.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">In a first, U.S. oil-and-gas companies are on track this year to export more propane than the next four largest exporting countries combined—OPEC members Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Nigeria, which have long dominated the trade—according to</span> analytics provider IHS Inc. IHS -0.11%decrease; <span id=""4"" class=""red"">red down pointing triangle U.S. exports already account for more than a third of the overall market for waterborne shipments, IHS said.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Propane exports hit an all-time high <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 884,000 barrels</span> a day in February, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.</span> Platts Analytics, an energy data provider, projects that a new record was set in May, for which government data aren’t yet available. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The exports have been enabled by a new network of pipelines, shipping terminals and tankers that doubled capacity from a year ago.

</span>“It’s been a major source of investment and one of the big success stories,” said Ron Logan, a partner at energy investing firm Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors LP.

Propane, a natural-gas liquid, is a byproduct of natural-gas drilling and refining crude oil. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">After the shale boom made propane more plentiful, exports became a widely sought solution because it is much easier to bottle and ship than other fuels.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">About half of all U.S. exports wind up in Latin America, while the rest goes to northwest Europe and Asian markets.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2013,</span> the U.S. overtook Qatar as the world’s top propane shipper.

The dominant U.S. position could benefit further from the expansion of the Panama Canal, which in June completed <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $5.4 billion</span> upgrade. That project allows the large ships transporting propane to make faster and cheaper trips to big Asian markets like Japan, China and South Korea.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">All this is a welcome development for U.S. oil-and-gas drillers stung by a rout in commodity prices that has led to dozens of bankruptcies.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">The fuel came up from shale in such overwhelming supply that producers sometimes had to pay customers to take it off their hands.

</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">Now, investors are betting prices will continue to climb.</span> Propane producers and shippers are among the top performing stocks this year.

Shares of Range Resources Corp., an exploration and production company that ships propane that it extracts in Pennsylvania, are <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 81% year</span> to date. Pipeline and processing companies Oneok Inc. and DCP Midstream Partners LP have <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">gained 93% and</span><span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 41%,</span> respectively.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">The export capabilities are enabling U.S. producers to capitalize on the premium in overseas propane prices versus the domestic price.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The sales are easing a domestic propane glut that had been dragging on prices.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">Propane recently fetched premiums to U.S. prices of <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 20% and</span><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 29% in</span> Europe and Japan, respectively, according to the Oil Price Information Service.

</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">Domestic prices have been rising, <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up 78% from</span> a 14-year low <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 29.6 cents</span> a gallon hit in January, according to Platts Analytics.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Trading at <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 53 cents</span> a gallon at the main U.S. trading hub in Mont Belvieu, Texas, propane prices are still on the cheap side of their historical levels.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Yet analysts expect prices to rise further as more propane is sold abroad and to new chemical factories starting up on the Gulf Coast.

</span><span id=""18"" class=""red"">The rise in wholesale prices hasn’t hit most consumers yet.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">Retail propane prices averaged <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $2.24 a</span> gallon in New York state in May, the most recent data available, down <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 10% from</span> the year before, according to the state’s Energy Research and Development Authority.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">The rise in prices will likely be felt by the six million mostly rural U.S. households that heat their homes with large tanks of propane.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">The higher prices have caused pain for some companies.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">Dow Chemical Co. built expensive propane-fed factories that were planned with fuel costs at rock-bottom prices.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Other chemical makers, including Ascend Performance Materials Operations LLC, have delayed plans for propane-fed plants, due to rising construction costs and higher raw material costs.

</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">“Propane will be increasing in price faster than all the other hydrocarbons,” said Rusty Braziel, a former propane trader who runs consultant RBN Energy.</span> “From the standpoint of chemical companies, it’s not such good news.”

<span id=""25"" class=""red"">Some analysts warn that pipeline owners and shippers may have already overbuilt and will have to lower the rates they charge to win business.

</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. called the expanding export infrastructure business “a little like youth basketball, lots of participation trophies but fewer winners.”

</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">Already daily shipping rates have plummeted to as little <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $20,000,</span> down from <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $120,000 or</span> so it cost last summer, as dozens of new tankers hit the water, the Houston investment bank said.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Financial markets have come to expect the ECB to cut interest rates, possibly as early as May.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">But Mr. Trichet spoke more about containing inflation than sustaining growth.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The ECB wants to keep inflation just <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">below 2% over</span> the medium term, but the annual rate <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 3.1% in</span> November and December.

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">Economists believe that the ECB will eventually respond to signs of a significant loss of momentum in the euro-zone economy, although they disagree on when the central bank will first cut rates.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Yesterday, despite inflation estimated to be as high <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 10% in</span> some Gulf Cooperation Council states, Arab oil producers, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain followed the Fed and lowered official interest rates to keep their currencies aligned with the dollar, while raising banks' reserve requirements to rein in liquidity.</span> Omani central bankers said a move was expected in the coming week.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Bank of England Gov. Mervyn King earlier this week indicated British rates may come down in February but that any cuts will be far more gradual than those made by the Fed.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Minutes from January's Bank of England meeting, released yesterday, showed the bank's policy committee voted 8-1 to hold interest rates unchanged.</span> The lone dissent was perennial dove David Blanchflower, who called for a further quarter-point cut.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Separately, Norway's central bank left key interest rate unchanged <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 5.25%,</span> underlining the continued strength of the country's economy.

</span>There was no immediate response from central banks in Asia. <span id=""11"" class=""red"">If the Fed's emergency cut -- and an expected further cut next week -- soothes markets and bolsters U.S. demand, Asian central banks may be able to refocus on inflation-busting as their export-reliant economies maintain their vigor.

Rents <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 2.3% in</span> the second quarter compared with a year earlier, the smallest annual increase since the third quarter <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2010,</span> according to data from RealPage Inc. scheduled to be released on Wednesday. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Rental growth was flat in major cities with otherwise strong economies—such as Austin, Portland, Seattle, Dallas and Washington, D.C.—due to large amounts of new supply.

</span>While average rents continued to grow, individual landlords cut rents in some markets. In addition, landlords are offering tenants incentives including as many as three months paying no rent, free parking, credit for ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft, and Amazon gift cards for as much <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as $2,500,</span> according to renters, real-estate brokers and Hotpads, a rental search platform.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Joshua Clark, an economist at Hotpads who was looking recently for an apartment in the Capitol Hill area in Seattle, saw <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $2,500 Amazon</span> gift card offer.

</span>“I had my mouth open for a second. Seriously a lot of my expenses would be covered for the year, which would be fantastic,” he said.

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">Landlords have enjoyed a <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">record 32 straight</span> quarters of annual rent growth on average, as the U.S. economy strengthened and millennials delayed homeownership.</span> But the reports of slowing, which began in a few markets in <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2016,</span> have intensified to the point that the balance is shifting towards renters and away from landlords.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Greg Willett, chief economist at RealPage, predicted average rents nationwide could flatten if current trends continue.</span> “It’s kind of telling as we look at some of these individual markets that are losing momentum because they’re important ones,” Mr. Willett said.

<span id=""7"" class=""red"">The cause of the slowdown is primarily new supply.</span> Developers responded to escalating rents by building the most new apartments <span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 30 years</span>, sending a flood of new high-end units to downtown areas across the country. Developers are expected to <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">add 300,000 new</span> units over the next year across the U.S., Mr. Willett said.

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">At the same time as there are signs renter demand is starting to wane because millennials are marrying, having children and buying homes or moving into single-family rentals.</span> The U.S. <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">added 1.3 million</span> owner households in the first quarter over the same period last year and <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">lost 286,000 renter</span> households, according to U.S. Census data released in April.

Earlier this year, Manuel Valdes,<span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 33 years</span> old, and his wife got a surprise letter from his Seattle landlord offering to renew their lease -- <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for $50 less</span> than they were paying.

Their rent had gone <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">up $300 in</span> the three years they had lived there. “We had been dreading another jump in rents,” said Mr. Valdes, who is a journalist. His wife, Teresa Mosqueda, sits on the local city council. They now plan to use the extra money to save for a down payment for a house.

<span id=""9"" class=""red"">Landlords rely on the warm spring months to fill apartment buildings because renter demand trails off in the colder months of the years.</span> “The second quarter is when you get most of your rent growth for the year,” Mr. Willett said.

The softening is taking place even in high growth cities. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">For example, the Dallas metropolitan area has the strongest job growth in the country.

</span>But Dallas area rents were essentially flat in the second quarter, down <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 3.1% annual</span> rent growth in the second quarter last year and a recent high of more <span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 6% rent</span> growth in <span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2015.</span> Landlords there are offering tenants as much as two months of free rent.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">The problem in Dallas, landlords said, is simply too much supply.</span> Developers are building <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 22,000 apartments</span> right now, compared with a long-term average of less than half that.

“That’s just too much inventory,” said Ric Campo, chairman and chief executive of Camden Property Trust, one of the country’s largest apartment owners. <span id=""12"" class=""red"">“In order to get those apartments absorbed, even with good strong job growth, it’s taking the sizzle out of the market.”

</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">In Seattle, where Amazon has been an economic powerhouse and home-price growth has been the fastest in the country, landlords are also struggling to fill new units.

</span>Rents grew <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 0.5% in</span> Seattle compared with a year earlier, down from annual rent growth <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 5.6% in</span> the second quarter <span id=""47"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2017 and</span> a recent high <span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 8.6% rent</span> growth a year prior to that.

Michael Chotzen, a Seattle property manager, said some buildings near him in the Capitol Hill neighborhood are slashing security deposits, requiring tenants to put down several hundred dollars or nothing at all. But that can be risky. “If a tenant trashes a unit there needs to be funds to cover that,” he said.

<span id=""14"" class=""red"">Data released Tuesday from another apartment data provider, Reis Inc. also showed a largely weak rental market across the country in the second quarter.</span> The national vacancy rate ticked up <span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 4.8% from</span><span id=""50"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4.3% in</span> the second quarter <span id=""51"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2017.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">The number of additional units that were rented fell to just <span id=""52"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over 37,000 from</span> <span id=""53"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 53,000 a</span> year earlier, suggesting demand was weaker.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">Despite the recent slowdown, apartment owners note that the market is far from crashing and rent growth remains just below historic norms.

</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">Little concern has arisen that the softening could have broader economic repercussions for the U.S. financial system.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Compared with the last real-estate crash, owners say there are unlikely to be many foreclosures because they are carrying much less debt.

</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Jay Hiemenz, president and chief operating officer of Phoenix-based Alliance Residential, an apartment company, said banks are only giving loans to developers for <span id=""54"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 65% of</span> the cost to build a project, compared <span id=""55"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 80% or</span> more previously.

</span>“Absent some shock that none of us can see, we will have a softer landing,” he said.

65c7cc028f76694c5125d22b,54717,"<h3>From ‘Green Jesus’ to ‘radical pragmatist’: Canada's climate minister evolves</h3>Good morning and welcome to The Climate 202! Thanks to everyone who sent us feedback yesterday on the new “In the atmosphere” section of the newsletter. It sounds like many readers appreciate the new section. 😊 But first:

From ‘Green Jesus’ to ‘radical pragmatist’: Inside the evolution of Canada's environment minister

When top environmental ministers from the Group of Seven industrial countries met in Berlin in May, Steven Guilbeault was among them.

But for the first time in his long career, he was meeting with the ministers inside the summit, rather than protesting in the streets outside.

“Someone asked me, ‘Is it your first G-7 meeting?’” Guilbeault recalled in an interview with The <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Climate 202.</span></span> “I said: 'Well, it depends how you look at it. I've protested a number of them, but it's my first one inside. So it's an adjustment for sure.'”

Guilbeault,<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 52,</span> has served as Canada's minister of environment and climate change since October. Before entering the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, he spent more than two decades as an environmental activist with eyebrow-raising tactics.

<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 2001,</span> while working for Greenpeace, Guilbeault scaled Toronto's CN Tower and unfurled a banner that called Canada and President George W. Bush “climate killers.” The act of civil disobedience was meant to put pressure on Canada and America to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. It earned him the nickname “Green Jesus” among both fans and critics in the country's oil-rich west.

In April, however, Guilbeault made a decision that might have horrified his younger self: He approved the controversial Bay du Nord offshore oil project, which involves drilling up <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1 billion</span> barrels off Canada's east coast. The decision came two days after the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report that warned the world must rapidly phase out fossil fuels to stave off a climate catastrophe.

“I obviously didn't come into politics to approve oil projects,” Guilbeault told The <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Climate 202.</span></span> “If I was alone, making the decision for myself, it's not the decision I would have made. ... But I'm now the environment and climate change minister <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 38 million</span> people.”

The <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Climate 202 sat</span> down with Guilbeault on Monday at the Canadian Embassy in Washington, where he is meeting with U.S. officials including White House national climate adviser Gina McCarthy and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland. Here are highlights from the conversation:

The case for climate pragmatism

Guilbeault calls himself a “radical pragmatist.” <span id=""0"" class=""red"">To him, the phrase reflects his pursuit of “radical” policies to green Canada's economy — but also his recognition of harsh realities that complicate his lofty climate ambitions.

</span>“The ideas I promote are fairly radical,” he said. “I am proposing that we overhaul our energy systems, the way we move around, the way we build things, and the way we operate our plants and industries. But there is a part of me that understands it can't happen overnight.”

When giving the green light to the Bay du Nord project, Guilbeault set <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">forth 137 legally</span> binding conditions that the energy giant Equinor must comply with for the lifetime of the project. For the first time, the conditions include a requirement to reach net-zero emissions <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2050.</span>

“I never said that Bay du Nord was ‘green oil’ or ‘sustainable oil,'” Guilbeault said. “But factually speaking, to our knowledge, it will be the lowest-emitting project of its kind in the world.”

Guilbeault, who is an avid reader of scientific reports from the IPCC and the International Energy Agency, said both organizations recognize that continued oil production is consistent with the more ambitious goal of the Paris agreement: limiting global warming <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 1.5 degrees</span> Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.

“In <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 1.5</span>-scenario world <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2050,</span> we're producing <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 25 to</span><span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 35 million</span> barrels a day — down <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 100 million</span>, where we are now,” he said. “So it's a significant decrease in production. But there will still be oil consumed <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2050.</span> And therefore it should be the lowest-emitting oil possible.”

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Meanwhile, Guilbeault said he will probably press U.S. lawmakers this week on Democrats' plans to provide <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $12,500 tax</span> credit for people who buy electric vehicles made in America.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Ottawa has argued that the proposal, which was included in Democrats' stalled budget reconciliation bill, could force General Motors and Ford to relocate major manufacturing facilities from Canada to the United States.</span> Guilbeault warned that it could also undermine cross-border collaboration on securing the critical minerals used in EV batteries, including nickel and cobalt.

“U.S. decision-makers will have to decide,” he said, “whether they would rather have their nascent EV sector be dependent on critical minerals from Canada or from China.”

Guilbeault said the topic will probably come up when he meets with Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) this week. However, he is not meeting with Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W. Va.), the most important player in the talks over the spending bill — and a man who might especially appreciate his “radical pragmatist” approach.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Manchin eyes Sept.<span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 </span>deadline</span> for reconciliation

After a virtual meeting with Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Monday, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W. Va.) said he views Sept.<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 </span>— not the August recess — as the true deadline for reaching a deal on President Biden's long-stalled budget reconciliation package, Erik Wasson reports for Bloomberg News.

</span>Schumer has been pushing to clinch a deal before senators leave for their August break. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">However, Sept.<span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 30 </span>is when the <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">fiscal 2022 budget</span> resolution underpinning the bill expires.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Manchin added that his top priorities are making sure the bill doesn't worsen inflation, closes certain tax loopholes and lowers energy costs.</span> He also reiterated his support for increasing domestic fossil fuel production.

""From the energy thing, you can't do it unless you produce more. If there's people that don't want to produce more fossil, then you got a problem,"" Manchin said following the discussion, Manu Raju reports for CNN.

Europe braces for gas ‘nightmare’ as pipeline from Russia shuts off

Nord <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Stream 1,</span> the main natural gas pipeline connecting Russia and Germany, temporarily shut down Monday for scheduled maintenance, raising concerns over whether supplies will flow again as Moscow continues to use energy as leverage in the Ukraine war, The Washington Post's Loveday Morris, Reis Thebault and Amanda Coletta report.

The key pipeline provides <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 55 billion</span> cubic meters of natural gas annually to countries across Europe, despite much of the European Union agreeing to wean itself off Russian gas as quickly as possible. <span id=""6"" class=""red"">But some members of the bloc, including Germany, are still heavily reliant on Moscow for energy — a growing concern for the country as it tries to build gas reserves before the winter, when demand is at its highest.

</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, said that if the Kremlin does not turn the taps back on after <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 10 days</span> of scheduled work, the country would face a “nightmare scenario” this winter.

</span>“Everything is possible, everything can happen,” Habeck told Deutschlandfunk radio Sunday. “We have to prepare for the worst.”

<span id=""8"" class=""red"">Extreme heat poses test for Texas power grid

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) on Monday asked customers to conserve energy during the hottest times of the day amid a statewide heat wave, raising concern over whether Texas's beleaguered power grid could handle the record high demand, Matthew Cappucci reports for The Post.

ERCOT projected that on Monday <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 2 and</span><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3 p</span>.m., the statewide grid would be able to <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">generate 80,168 megawatts</span>.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">During the same window, demand was expected to <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">reach 79,671 MW</span>, leaving very little wiggle room.</span> The Lone Star state avoided rolling blackouts due to voluntary cutbacks from residents, but the calls to conserve energy could become a common practice this summer if the ongoing heat wave continues.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">When local demand exceeds capacity, most states and municipalities can borrow energy from a neighbor.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">But Texas has been energy-independent since the early 20th century, leaving the state reliant on its own grid even in high-demand scenarios.

</span>The threat of blackouts during severe weather is not new to Texas’s grid. In <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2021,</span><span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.5 million</span> residents were left without power when temperatures dipped to dangerously low levels.

Some of the world's oldest trees are at risk in Yosemite wildfire

A wildfire raging within Yosemite National Park is threatening Mariposa Grove, which is home to some of the biggest and oldest trees on Earth, The Post's Dino Grandoni reports.

The blaze, fueled in part by a climate-change-induced drought, covered <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly 2,720 acres</span> late Monday after doubling in size over the weekend. It poses a risk to the more <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 500 mature</span> giant sequoia trees that have inspired generations of trekkers and have attracted tourists from across the globe.

So far, none of the grove’s named trees — including the 209-foot Grizzly Giant, along with the Bachelor and Three Graces — have been damaged by the flames, according to Yosemite fire officials. The iconic trees can live for thousands of years and grow in only six dozen groves along the Sierra Nevada.

Although they typically survive low-to-medium-intensity blazes, recent fire seasons have grown to be longer and more intense, testing the trees’ tenacity. Already, three fires over the past three years have killed up <span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 19 percent</span> of the entire sequoia species.

65c7cc028f76694c5125d22b,2781,"<h3>Italy’s government promised to put ‘Italians first,’ but its policies are hurting Italians, too</h3>ROME — The building is seven stories tall, not far from the main train station, surrounded by cheap motels. Once, it was the bureaucratic headquarters for a government pension fund. Now, it is an illegal home <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 450 people</span> who sleep in the old office rooms, share bathroom cleanup duties, and take turns standing guard at the front entrance, ready to press an alarm button if and when authorities show up and order them to leave.
Some of the people in the building are newly arrived immigrants — the targets of a law-and-order clampdown by Italy’s populist government.
Others, though, might have expected support from a government that has promised to put “Italians first.”
“I am an Italian,” said Maurizio Zanga,<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 62,</span> a laid-off garbage collector who lives on the seventh floor next to a family of Somalis. “But I am not one of the first. I am one of the last.”
If Italy’s government offers a test case of what happens when populists come to power, the threat to clear illegally occupied buildings shows how defend-the-country measures can end up hurting citizens, too.
Interior Minister Matteo Salvini — head of the far-right League party — has said all squatted buildings in Rome will be cleared, “none excluded.” The Salvini decree, as his signature policy is known, is a sweeping security measure passed by the government in November and presented as a tool to push back against migration. It also raises penalties for squatters, no matter their nationality or legal status, who can face steeper fines and up to four years imprisonment.
Last December, when authorities in Rome cleared a particularly ramshackle building, Salvini showed up at the site and streamed a four-hour video of the operation. He posted on Facebook that the squatters were “mostly migrants.” The video footage included an interview with a man who said he was from Gambia and would sleep on the street that night.
“Send them back to Africa,” one poster wrote below.
“Bravo, Matteo,” another said.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">But the prevalence of squatters in Rome speaks not only to a five-year influx of people coming from the Middle East and Africa, but also to a generation-long economic stagnation — and the failure of one government after the next to provide a safety net.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">With a dearth of public housing, in a city plagued by economic misfortune and mismanagement, <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 10,000 and</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 11,000 people</span> live as squatters in abandoned factories, office buildings and other properties, according to city data.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Fabrizio Nizi, a housing activist, estimates <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">that 30 to</span><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 40 percent</span> of the squatters in Rome are Italians.</span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Some lost their jobs before retirement age and couldn’t find new positions.</span> Others have struggled to enter the workforce entirely. <span id=""4"" class=""red"">Some have applied for public housing, but the city faces a logjam, and new units are not being built.
</span>“People wait up <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 10 years</span> for a home,” Nizi said. “You need to wait for somebody to die.”
Rome has not taken an official stance on the squatters, but a city spokesman said that “plenty of the squatted buildings put the safety of their own squatters at risk. The goal is that of offering a dignified alternative.”
Some of the buildings are in dire shape — no windows, trash everywhere. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">The old pension building, though, more closely resembles a tidy low-income housing complex, albeit one with no heat.</span> The nameplates of old bureaucrats remain posted outside the office rooms. But some of the occupants have decorated their doors with stickers and art. Residents stage theater performances. Handwritten signs provide rules for a “civil coexistence.” <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The complex is managed by the residents with help from Action, a housing activist group.
</span>Experts say authorities are unlikely to forcibly clear all squatted buildings, as Salvini has promised. Still, Salvini has managed to raise the anxiety everywhere.
“Day and night, my children are suffering just thinking about it,” said Gianfranco Meneghetti,<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 53,</span></span> a resident on the seventh floor of the pension building.
Gianfranco was born in Ethiopia but is an Italian citizen. His eldest child, who <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">is 15,</span> sometimes asks what the family would do after eviction.
“There is nothing I can say to reassure him,” Meneghetti said.
Pension building residents said Salvini’s threats have also heightened an us-versus-them mentality. People said they notice changes in people on the outside, or even in themselves. <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Some of the Italian squatters have begun to grumble about the noise and cooking odors made by families from other countries, or about how Ramadan forces changes to building meeting times, or about how foreigners beat them out for low-paying cleaning and caretaking jobs.
</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Sabina Aristarco,<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 53,</span></span> an Italian who lives on the first floor, said she’d encountered employers who wanted only people from Africa.
</span>“You’d have to put on blinders not to see the problems with migration,” she said.
At the same time, she saw the benefits to migration, too. Her closest friends in the building were non-Italian. Her partner was from Tanzania. She saw how people from all over — those fluent in Italian and those just learning — could bicker but then settle disputes at weekly building meetings.
At those events, it has been Zanga who often played mediator — stepping into others’ arguments with the gruff and avuncular demeanor of the union boss he once was.
<span id=""9"" class=""red"">He was established in his career with a waste management company when he was told, in <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2016,</span> that he no longer had a job.</span> He asked his wife and son to go to Colombia, his wife’s home country, where they had family to help them. Zanga tried to stay afloat. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Unemployment benefits kicked in, but the payments dwindled month by month until they reached zero.</span> By <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">early 2017,</span> he could no longer pay his rent. By mid-2017, authorities were at his door with an eviction notice. He sold a Sony television for <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $100 to</span> pay for a moving van. Then, with his last possessions — a bed, a robot vacuum cleaner, artwork portraying a Tibetan bridge that he says helps him relax — he showed up on the seventh floor. He told almost none of his family and friends what was happening to him.
“I had a normal life. Books, furniture,” he said, with money to spend to have pizza nights with friends. “Here, I’ve closed myself off.”
Zanga said that falling to the bottom rung has prompted him to gradually reevaluate his views. Until several years ago, he said, he was a “false Democrat,” somebody whose opinions hadn’t yet been tested by hardship. Sometimes, he curses to himself about some of the foreigners living around him, who tend to be younger and have larger, noisier families.
“I have become a bit of a jerk in here. Sometimes I feel like saying, ‘Go back to your own country,’ ” Zanga said. “And then I think to myself, what . . . are you saying?”
But Zanga still doesn’t grasp the goal of clearing out squatters entirely. If he’s kicked out, where would he go? Under a bridge? Another squatted building? For him, there is no country to return to.
“If we were kicked out tomorrow, you still haven’t solved the problem,” Zanga said. “Without a doubt the [government] is reducing the spaces for humanity. Those with a normal social life are inside the fortress. And those who are poor are on the outside.”

Daily Close of S&<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 Since</span> Peak on Jan.<span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3
A</span> chaotic day on Wall Street extended the longest period of market turmoil <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 2001,</span> with stocks on Friday briefly descending into bear market territory, a symbolic marker of investors’ deep pessimism about the health of the global economy and the buying power of the American consumer.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">The S&<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 has</span> fallen for seven consecutive weeks, its worst stretch since the dot-com bubble burst more than two decades ago.</span> After <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 3 percent</span> drop this week, the index is <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">down 14 percent</span> since early April.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Friday afternoon, the S&<span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 crossed</span> the bear market threshold of <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a 20 percent</span> decline from its peak on Jan.<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.</span></span> <span id=""3"" class=""red"">But with less <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30 minutes</span> left before trading ended, after hours of churn and a drop of as much <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">as 2.3 percent</span>, the market rallied and ended a hair above where it had started the day.
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">That was little consolation for investors, many of whom have grown accustomed to years of robust returns and have never seen a market upheaval like this.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">With this week’s relentless slide and Friday’s wild swing was a constant worry on Wall Street that rising inflation, compounded by the war in Ukraine, might tip the economy into a recession.</span> At the heart of those fears was fresh evidence reported this week from retailers like Walmart and Target that rising costs were now hitting corporate America.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">During the darkest days of the pandemic, the American economy was propelled by consumers.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Even as the costs of goods, transportation and labor increased, companies were able to pocket record profits by raising prices, confident that people would continue buying.</span> But this week brought indications that some consumers may have reached their limit, and profits have started to shrink.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">“What the companies are telling us is that they are starting to notice that their consumer is responding to inflation,” said Jay Sole, a retail analyst at UBS.</span> “We were worried about this moment and we were waiting for this moment, and now it’s here.”
Recessions have often followed bear markets, though one does not necessarily cause the other. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">A bear market occurred in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, but it was the shortest on record, lasting <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">just 33 days</span> before stocks began to rally.</span> <span id=""10"" class=""red"">Less than six months later, the S&<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">P 500 began</span> hitting new highs again, <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">climbing 42 percent</span> above its prepandemic level before starting to slide in January.</span> Now the index is down more <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 18 percent</span> from its high point.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Friday’s turbulent trading came after months of investors fretting about how serious and long-lasting inflation would be and how aggressively the Federal Reserve would have to raise rates to slow the rising cost of living.
</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">James Bullard, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said during an interview on Fox Business on Friday that raising interest rates by half a point at coming central bank meetings was “a good plan for now.”
Mr. Bullard struck a relatively unconcerned tone about markets, despite the day’s volatility.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">“You would expect with the Fed raising rates, that all of these assets — trillions of dollars worldwide — would have to be repriced,” Mr. Bullard said.
</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">What set this week apart was a grim earnings report on Tuesday from Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, which confirmed many investors’ worst fears about inflation.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""red"">For the first time in many years, Walmart said its quarterly profits had fallen, a sign to many analysts that the retailer could not pass along many of its rising costs to consumers without risking a slowdown in sales.</span> Target and Kohl’s also said quarterly profits had plunged, adding to Wall Street’s unease.
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">Walmart said that some of its customers were buying less-expensive meats and other food items as costs soared, and that sales of certain discretionary goods like clothing had slowed, as budget-conscious shoppers focused instead on buying necessities like groceries.</span> <span id=""17"" class=""red"">The company’s executives said they saw no signs of inflation starting to abate.
</span>“There is a lot of uncertainty moving forward,” Walmart’s chief executive, Doug McMillon, said in a conference call with Wall Street analysts on Tuesday. “Things are very fluid.”
Globally, investors can find little comfort. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the response from other countries has disrupted crucial supplies of energy, wheat and other staples. <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Poor countries face a gathering catastrophe over hunger and debt.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">Janet L. Yellen, the Treasury secretary, said high food and energy prices were creating “stagflationary effects” — the combination of high inflation and a stagnating economy.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">China’s economy, the world’s second-largest after that of the United States, is laboring under the government’s strict pandemic lockdowns.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">Before the war in Ukraine and Covid’s resurgence in China, the International Monetary Fund was projecting global growth <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 4.4 percent</span> this year.</span> Now its forecast is<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 3.</span>6 percent.
<span id=""22"" class=""red"">Wall Street had been expecting that torrid consumer demand would have to slow at some point.</span> <span id=""23"" class=""red"">Government stimulus checks that provided Americans with billions in spending money during the pandemic stopped long ago.</span> <span id=""24"" class=""red"">The hope of both the Trump and Biden administrations was that the economy could eventually be weaned off the stimulus and that consumer demand would stay relatively strong.
</span><span id=""25"" class=""red"">But inflation, which has risen faster and remained more persistent than many investors and even the Fed initially expected, has thrown the recovery into doubt.
</span><span id=""26"" class=""red"">Unemployment is approaching the lowest rate in decades, and the economy has regained <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 95 percent</span> of <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 22 million</span> jobs lost at the height of coronavirus lockdowns.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">Average hourly earnings in the U.S. <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 5.5 percent</span> in the year through April, but many of those gains are being eroded by inflation.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">Over that same period, prices <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 8.3 percent</span>.
</span><span id=""29"" class=""red"">“The government just turbocharged the economy, and we were partying on buying goods,” said Scott Mushkin, the founder of R5 Capital, a retail-focused consulting and financial research firm.</span> “People wondered what the hangover would be like. We have never seen anything like this.”
<span id=""30"" class=""red"">To be sure, some retailers said that not every consumer was pulling back or shifting spending.</span> Walmart said better-off shoppers continued to spend freely on bigger-ticket items like patio furniture, and Target said it was not seeing a broad retreat in spending, either. <span id=""31"" class=""red"">Home Depot, which has benefited from a pandemic remodeling boom, said it was seeing no big slowdown in business.
</span><span id=""32"" class=""red"">But Mr. Sole of UBS worries that if prices continue to climb, higher-income consumers will eventually shift their spending, too.
</span><span id=""33"" class=""red"">“Right now, lower-income consumers are feeling inflation more acutely,” he said.</span> <span id=""34"" class=""red"">“The worry is, what if it affects all income and demographic groups?”
</span><span id=""35"" class=""red"">For months, the mixed signals have been confounding Wall Street as it tries to forecast future profits and how high interest rates will climb.
</span>The current conditions are also confusing to even the most experienced executives, who are finding it difficult to plan their inventory and staffing. <span id=""36"" class=""red"">Walmart, which is known for successfully navigating the last period of persistently high inflation, in the 1970s, acknowledged this week that it had too many employees in the first quarter and that it had not anticipated how rapidly the increase in gasoline prices would inflate costs in its supply chain.</span> The company’<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 25 percent</span> decline in profit from the previous year was a big surprise to analysts.
“If these companies can’t handle this, it tells you something really unusual is afoot,” Mr. Mushkin said.

65c7cc028f76694c5125d22b,68056,"<h3>Bank of England Raises Key Interest Rate by 0.75 Point</h3><span id=""0"" class=""red"">LONDON—The Bank of England raised its key interest rate <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 0.75 percentage</span> point on Thursday, the largest increase <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">since 1989,</span> in an effort to tame surging inflation but which, by the bank’s own estimates, will help drive the U.K. economy into a recession lasting over a year.
</span>The central bank lifted its benchmark lending rate for the eighth consecutive meeting <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3% from</span><span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2.25%,</span> taking it to the highest level since <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 2008.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">Higher borrowing costs will hurt an already weak economy as consumers brace for a difficult winter of falling real incomes and rising prices.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The bank said the U.K. economy likely entered a recession in the three months through September, when output fell an <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">estimated 0.5%,</span> and said it expected a lengthy economic contraction, the duration and depth of which depended on how high the bank raises rates to corral prices.
</span>“It is a tough road ahead,” Bank of England Gov. Andrew Bailey said at a news conference. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">“The sharp rise in energy prices has made us poorer as a nation.”
</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">After the announcement, the pound weakened against the dollar, <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">trading 1.8% lower</span>, and U.K. government bonds sold off.</span> The yield on the 10-year bond rose <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3.515%,</span> <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 3.421% the</span> previous day. Shorter-dated bonds initially rallied, but reversed to sell off as well.
The unusually large rate rise underscores the difficult choices faced by European central banks. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Across the continent, soaring energy prices from the Ukraine war are driving inflation even as high energy costs hurt businesses and economic activity far more than in the U.S., where energy costs are lower.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">For central banks, raising borrowing costs to contain the inflation will only increase the economic pain.
</span><span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Bank of England made it clear that the amount it raises the key lending rate could cause significant damage to economic growth.</span> <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The bank said that if it raises interest rates to the level expected by U.K. financial markets—to a peak <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 5.25% late</span> next year—that would cause the economy to <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">contract 1.5% next</span> year and a <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">further 1% in</span><span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2024,</span> causing unemployment to rise <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 6.5% by</span> the end <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2025.</span></span> That would mark the longest U.K. recession since records began in the 1920s.
The bank, however, signaled that it doesn’t expect to raise rates as much as investors anticipate. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">“Further increases in Bank Rate may be required for a sustainable return of inflation to target, albeit to a peak lower than priced into financial markets,” it said.
</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">Still, even if the bank keeps its current rate <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3%,</span> the U.K. economy is likely to endure a recession until the last quarter of next year, it said.
</span><span id=""11"" class=""red"">The reaction on financial markets, including higher yields on U.K. government debt, suggested that some investors are concerned the BOE won’t be aggressive enough in raising rates and that inflation could remain elevated in the long-term.</span> <span id=""12"" class=""red"">Higher inflation would also undermine the value of the pound.
</span><span id=""13"" class=""red"">“The big surprise for markets today is Bailey saying that market pricing for the terminal rate is too high,” said Jordan Rochester, foreign exchange strategist at Nomura.</span> “That’s helped accelerate sterling lower.”
The Bank of England’s move came a day after the Federal Reserve also raised its key rate by three-quarters of a percentage point and signaled plans to keep raising it, possibly in smaller increments but to higher levels than previously anticipated—a different message than the one from the U.K. central bank.
<span id=""14"" class=""red"">Bank of England officials said the likely divergence in interest-rate paths reflects the fact that the U.K.’s economic outlook is darker.
</span>“The pandemic was a common shock to all of us, the war is not,” said Deputy Gov. Ben Broadbent, referring to the conflict in Ukraine. “We have a really big difference in the path of growth and that explains quite a lot of what divergence there is in policy.”
<span id=""15"" class=""red"">The Bank of England first raised its key rate in December, three months earlier than the Fed, but has since moved more cautiously.</span> <span id=""16"" class=""red"">That has drawn criticism that it hasn’t tightened policy enough to clamp down on inflation, but some former policy makers also say the central bank can do little to affect energy prices and shouldn’t raise its key rate further.
</span><span id=""17"" class=""red"">As in other parts of Europe, the U.K. is facing a surge in inflation, driven mostly by a jump in energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Moscow’s decision to choke off natural-gas supplies to Europe.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">In <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 12 months</span> through September, U.K. prices <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 10.1%,</span> matching the July figure in recording the fastest increase <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 40 years</span>.
</span><span id=""19"" class=""red"">The U.K. central bank’s policy decision comes after a period of economic and political turbulence triggered by a surprise package of tax cuts announced by former Prime Minister Liz Truss in late September.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red"">The absence of a plan to contain government borrowing over the medium term spooked investors, leading to a collapse in government-bond prices and the departure of Ms. Truss a month later.</span> <span id=""21"" class=""red"">The Bank of England bought government bonds to prevent a market meltdown.
</span><span id=""22"" class=""red"">Since then, the U.K. government has shelved the tax-cut plans and vowed a series of tax increases and spending cuts that it says will lower debt as a share of the economy later this decade, easing pressure on the central bank to try to offset the inflationary impact of Ms. Truss’s plans through far larger rate increases.</span> The central bank said it hadn’t taken account of those planned moves in its decision Thursday, but will do when it next decides policy in December.
<span id=""23"" class=""red"">“The most important thing the British government can do right now is to restore stability, sort out our public finances, and get debt falling so that interest-rate rises are kept as low as possible,” said Jeremy Hunt, the U.K.’s Treasury chief, in response to the central bank’s move.
</span><span id=""24"" class=""red"">The central bank’s decision to raise borrowing costs will add to the difficulties facing households and businesses as they prepare to navigate a winter of recession and rising prices, a combination that will squeeze incomes.

Figures released by the Bank of England on Monday showed households cut their credit-card borrowing <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 100 million</span> pounds, equivalent <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to $114 million</span>, in September from £700 million in August, while new loans for house purchases fell <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 66,800 from</span><span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 74,400.</span> <span id=""26"" class=""red"">A survey of manufacturers released Tuesday showed factory output fell in October, while a sharp decline in new orders prompted the first reduction in employment in almost two years.</span> <span id=""27"" class=""red"">A similar survey of service providers released Thursday recorded the largest decline in activity since <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">January 2021,</span> when the economy was in lockdown to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.
</span><span id=""28"" class=""red"">The Bank of England said Thursday a government cap on energy prices that is set to last until April would limit the rate of inflation during that period, and expects a peak <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 10.9% before</span> the end of this year, down <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 13% previously</span>.</span> <span id=""29"" class=""red"">But the central bank forecast the inflation rate would remain high through next year and only fall back below <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 2% target</span> <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2024.</span>
</span><span id=""30"" class=""red"">The immediate outlook for interest rates is complicated by divisions among the nine members of the MPC.</span> While seven of those voted to raise the key rate <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 3%,</span> Swati Dhingra voted for a half-point rise, and Silvana Tenreyro voted for a quarter-point move.

</span>As new communities go into lockdown in hopes of slowing the spread of the virus, the people most at risk for getting sick, because they must venture out, are largely people of color, those with only a high school education and those whose incomes are likely to suffer during the ongoing crisis.
The concern came to a head last week as the big three auto manufacturers, GM, Ford and Chrysler, gave in to demands by the United Auto Workers union and took the extraordinary measure of shutting their plants for two weeks amid fears of the pandemic. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said all nonessential businesses in the state had to keep their workforces at home, saying: “This is not life as usual. Accept it, realize it and deal with it.”
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">Despite those attempts to limit contact in the workplace, many industries — from aerospace and defense to the service sector — remain open, renewing calls to protect workers’ health and shield them from the financial fallout of the pandemic.
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">During the past few decades, the growth of the digital economy has made it possible for an expanding number of people to work remotely — <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">nearly 30 percent</span> of American workers,<span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 35.7 million</span> people, can do that, according to a survey from 2017-2018 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">But workers who make cars and airplanes, cook french fries, clean hospital rooms, and rely on wrenches and brooms, not Internet connections, for their jobs cannot.
</span>Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.
The divide is stark within industries. <span id=""5"" class=""red""><span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 60 percent</span> of people who said they work in “management, business and financial operations” told the BLS that they could work from home.</span> But fewer <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 10 percent</span> of workers said they could do so in categories described as “services,” “construction and extraction,” “installation, maintenance and repair,” “production” and “transportation and material moving.”
There are also divisions along race and class lines. Thirty-seven percent of Asian Americans <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 30 percent</span> of whites said they could work remotely. But <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 20 percent</span> of African Americans <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 16 percent</span> of Hispanics said they had that ability. <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Almost 52 percent</span> of those with a college education or higher said they could work from home, but <span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">only 4 percent</span> of those with less than a high school diploma said they could.
<span id=""6"" class=""red"">“It is really shedding light on some inequalities in a new way,” said Heidi Shierholz, former chief economist for the Labor Department, now at the Economic Policy Institute.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">“A lot of people who have highly paid, white-collar jobs that are computer-focused can adjust to this crisis without a lot of pain.</span> And then there’s a much larger group that can’t adjust without a lot of pain to themselves and their families.”
Social media is full of photos of quarantined families gathered around the dining room table, parents with their laptops out, children with their schoolwork spread around them. For those who have the flexibility to work in their pajamas, the coronavirus might become a fun anecdote for the future, if life returns to normal in a few weeks or months.
<span id=""8"" class=""red"">“We’ll have stories to tell about how we had a little more time together with our family,” said David Wilcox, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</span> “That’s not the case for a line worker at a manufacturing plant. They need to show up at a specific physical location regardless of whether that’s convenient for them or not. And that presents a personal health risk to themselves, and a public health challenge because it also presents a risk to their co-workers.”
In many cases, manufacturing and service-sector workers don’t have paid sick leave, and can’t afford to miss work. That makes life particularly difficult for those who have to scramble to care for elderly parents susceptible to serious illness and look after children home from school.
“A lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck,” said Chris Wiers, president of Local S6 of the Machinists Union that <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">represents 8,000 workers</span> at the Bath Iron Works shipbuilding factory in Maine. “You go two weeks without pay or more and you risk losing your house, your car, and a lot of people have those concerns.”
Terrence Wise, a 40-year-old father of three teenage girls, was sent home 2½ hours before the end of his shift Tuesday night as a manager at a McDonald’s in Kansas City, Mo. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">The restaurant was serving only drive-through customers, sales were way down, and so the owner started sending people home.
</span>“I <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">make $13 an</span> hour, so to lose 2½ hours, that’s <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">over $25,</span>” he said. “That’s a meal on the table for my girls. That’s one-fourth of my lighting bill.”
With no paid sick leave or health insurance, he fears things are only going to get worse — more lost hours, possibly layoffs and the difficulty of coming up with <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $1,200 a</span> month he needs for rent.
“To say I’m concerned is an understatement,” he said. “I’m scared to death.”
Even some older workers, who are at a heightened risk of dying from the virus should they contract it, are still actively reporting to work.
<span id=""10"" class=""red"">One is Karla Wagoner,<span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 71,</span> who depends on her $12-an-hour income as a nonmedical home health-care aide to meet <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the $1,750 monthly</span> rent she splits with her son in Fort Collins, Colo.</span> Recently she had to cash out her retirement account to buy a new car after her old one became too expensive to maintain.
Lately, her clients are fearful of an outsider coming into their home, she said, and many have canceled. She has only nine hours booked for the coming week and is worried about what comes next.
“Without the hours, I don’t know what’s going to happen,” Wagoner said.
<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Several unions said they were struggling to get employers to create safe work environments.
</span>“There’s a lot of things that aren’t available — masks, hand sanitizer, gloves, things to specifically cut down on the rate of passing the virus on to other co-workers,” said Jon Holden, president of Machinists Union <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">District 751,</span> which <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">represents 32,000 Boeing</span> workers in Washington state.
<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Boeing, which has had about a dozen of its employees in the area test positive, said in a statement that the “health and safety of our employees is our top priority, and we’re partnering closely with public health officials to monitor and prevent the spread of COVID-19,” the disease caused by the coronavirus.</span> The company is “taking extra precautions to ensure cleanliness in our factories and offices. This includes more frequent cleaning of high-touch surfaces and common areas,” it said. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">And if an employee does test positive, “we are taking swift action to ensure the affected employee is provided with the immediate medical care and guidance they need.”
Holden, however, said the company could be doing more.
</span>“We need to ensure people have the proper personal protective equipment,” he said. “And in some instances we’re requesting there be special training. There’s a lot of concern. Our members work in and around each other in close quarters.”
At Bath Iron Works, the shipyard run by defense contractor General Dynamics, where some workers <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">make $15.97 an</span> hour, union officials have called for the factory to be shut down. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">They were also concerned when the company that provides bus service to the factory from employee parking lots discontinued operation as a precaution to prevent the spread of the virus.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">Instead of standing down, company officials asked employees to take over the bus service so work could continue, Wiers said.
</span>“The company seems to be taking every advantage not to do the right thing,” he said. “I know people who have those licenses who said, ‘Are you crazy? No way I’m doing that.’ It obviously sends the message that we don’t care, we need you in the shipyard and we need you to be productive.”
<span id=""16"" class=""red"">In a statement to The Washington Post, the company said it has “implemented CDC-recommended measures to protect our workers in the labor intensive, heavy manufacturing shipyard environment.”</span> And in a statement posted on the company website, it added, “neither the Department of Defense nor the Navy has directed us to stop work or otherwise relieved us from our contract or schedule requirements. This is no different for us than it is for other major U.S. defense manufacturers.”
<span id=""17"" class=""red"">The company “has taken measures to slow the spread of COVID-19” and “to ensure the employment security of our employees should they be unable to work or choose not to work.”
</span>On Friday, Ellen Lord, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, issued a memo saying defense industry workers, such as those in Bath, were performing duties vital to national defense and are “expected to maintain their normal work schedules.”
At the Kohler factories in Sheboygan, Wis., the stark divide between who can work from home and who cannot is readily apparent, said Tim Tayloe, the president of United Auto Workers union <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">Local 833,</span> which represents <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 1,900 workers</span> at several factories run by Kohler.
Workers who must remain at their posts are sitting one foot from one another in one factory, a facility that makes engines for tractors and generators, while many on the administrative side are working from home.
Tayloe said the union and the company are “working hard to keep everybody safe on the floor.” That includes extra efforts to sanitize tools and surfaces and moving shifts around so there are fewer people in one place.
<span id=""18"" class=""red"">Still, some in the factory have acknowledged an uncomfortable divide between the company’s office employees who can work from home and those who have to be on-site.
</span>“What are we, second-class citizens to the people that work in the office?” Tayloe asked.
In Ottumwa, Iowa, pretty much everything is shut down — the schools, the churches. But not the John Deere factory, which has stayed open, humming along. And the workers are in close quarters, whether they like it or not.
“Social distancing kind of seems like a joke in a factory setting,” said Julia McFarland,<span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 42,</span> who works a robotic welding machine there.
She thinks the plant should be temporarily closed. And with a 66-year-old mother, she’s concerned workers will spread the virus without knowing they have it, and bring it home to more vulnerable family members.
“It almost feels like they’re playing God with your health,” McFarland said. “They don’t seem to really care whether we’re exposed to this or not. We have office people that have been sent to work from home. And here we are in the factory. You’re just kind of at a loss for what to do.”
John Deere did not respond to a request for comment.
<span id=""19"" class=""red"">Mike Doherty, the owner of M&N Absolute Auto, an auto repair shop in Everett, Wash., said business was down last week.</span> But customers were still bringing in cars for repair, and his mechanics are there to help.
“We can’t fix people’s cars from home,” he said. “And we need to help people get to work.”",0,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,

Report finds the economy expanded across the Fed’<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 12 districts</span></span>
WASHINGTON—A tightening labor market is putting broader pressure on wages as U.S. firms increasingly report trouble filling low-skilled jobs, according to a new Federal Reserve report.
</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">In a couple regions, “worker shortages and increased labor costs were restraining growth in some sectors, including manufacturing, transportation and construction,” the Fed said Wednesday in a roundup of anecdotal information on regional economic conditions, known as the beige book.</span> The latest report was based on anecdotes covering mid-February through the end of March across the central bank’<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 12 districts</span></span>.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">The report found that “modest wage increases broadened” and “employers in most districts had more difficulty filling low-skilled positions, although labor demand was stronger for higher skilled workers.”
More broadly, the Fed said economic activity expanded across <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">all 12 districts</span>, “with the pace of expansion equally split between modest and moderate.”
</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Inflation continued to firm, with prices reported as rising modestly.</span> <span id=""4"" class=""red"">“Businesses mostly expected mild to moderate price growth to persist in the next several months,” the report said.
</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">Some districts reported uncertainty about the outlook for trade policy under the Trump administration.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">The Boston Fed said “a manufacturer of test equipment which exports a significant portion of its production worried about trade deals.”</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The Dallas Fed said “a few manufacturing contacts noted considerable policy uncertainty, especially regarding any changes that would impact trade with Mexico.”
</span>A few businesses also raised immigration concerns. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">The Minneapolis Fed said “firms catering to tourists in the Black Hills region reported difficulty finding labor, especially seasonal immigrant labor they have traditionally used.”</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">And in the San Francisco Fed’s district, “hotel stays were lower than expected due to changes in immigration policy and increased scrutiny of foreign arrivals,” the report said.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">Those calls, which echo earlier concerns from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), reflect growing criticism among left-leaning economists and Fed watchers who say the central bank is going too far and risks overcorrecting and pushing the economy into a recession.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The Fed has raised its policy rate five times since the spring, and plans to hike rates two more times before the end of the year.</span> But those moves operate with a lag, and it will be months before officials fully understand the scope — and toll — of such forceful action.

Updated Nov.<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 22,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2017 12</span>:47 pm ET

BEIRUT—Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri said Wednesday he was holding off on submitting his resignation at the request of President Michel Aoun, another startling turn in a crisis that thrust his country back into the middle of a regional power struggle between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

Shortly after his announcement, the capital Beirut erupted in celebration, with marching crowds and convoys of cars and motorcycles pouring into the streets of downtown. Thousands of supporters made their way to Mr. Hariri’s Beirut home where a frenzied crowd screamed and chanted when he stepped outside and mingled among them.

Mr. Hariri returned to Lebanon on Tuesday night for the first time since he announced his intention to resign on Nov.<span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 4 while</span> on visiting Saudi Arabia. He said he would delay his decision after he attended Lebanese Independence Day celebrations on Wednesday morning, still acting in his role as head of government.

“I offered my resignation to the president who hoped that I would hold off handing it in so that we can discuss the reasons and the background behind it,” he said from the presidential palace after meeting Mr. Aoun. “I said I will comply with this wish,” he added, according to a statement carried by the state-run National News Agency.

Mr. Hariri’s resignation set off a political crisis in Lebanon, upsetting the fragile balance of power here divided along sectarian lines. The small country is about one-third Sunni Muslim, one-third Shiite Muslim and one-third Christian, and remains deeply scarred by its 1975-90 civil war.

In announcing his resignation initially, Mr. Hariri—the political leader of Lebanon’s Sunni Muslims—cited Shiite Iran’s influence in his country, where its proxy Hezbollah is the most powerful military and political force. He also said he felt his life was in danger and these times were reminiscent <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2005 when</span> his father—a former prime minister—was assassinated in Beirut.

On Wednesday, Mr. Hariri said there would now be a dialogue about the issues he raised in his resignation statement weeks earlier. This could well kick off another drawn-out period of political uncertainty in Lebanon, much like the paralysis of the government for two years from 2014-2016 when rival political parties couldn’t agree on a president.

After Mr. Hariri’s resignation announcement, he remained in Saudi Arabia—a Sunni monarchy that was his longtime patron and ally—for two weeks. He left there over the weekend, making brief stops in France, Egypt and Cyprus on his way back to Lebanon. In Paris, Mr. Hariri promised he would clarify the still-mysterious reasons behind his resignation once he returned to Lebanon.

Mr. Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, and others familiar with the situation accused Saudi Arabia of pressuring Mr. Hariri to resign and holding him in the country for those two weeks against his will—a claim Riyadh denied. But Mr. Hariri’s rollback on Wednesday gave further credence to this notion in the minds of some Lebanese.

“Clearly, the fact that he withdrew his resignation is being viewed as proof that it had been forced,” said a Lebanese lawmaker allied with Mr. Hariri.

“The decision to resign was his and the decision to suspend his resignation is his,” said Saudi ambassador to the U.S. Prince Khalid bin Salman. “Saad Hariri is a friend of the Kingdom and we will continue to support him and all other Lebanese regardless of political or religious affiliation who are working for the best interests of Lebanon including efforts to build a stable Lebanese state free of the destructive influence of Iran’s proxies.”

For the past year or so, Mr. Hariri has served in a coalition government with Hezbollah—a power-sharing deal initially backed by the Saudis. But Saudi Arabia had long wanted Mr. Hariri’s Sunni bloc to curb Hezbollah’s influence and grew increasingly frustrated by its inability to do so.

Last year, Saudi Arabia <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">suspended $3 billion</span> in planned military aid to Lebanon in response to what it described as Hezbollah’s dominance of Lebanon’s government. After Mr. Hariri resigned, a Saudi official said Hezbollah was in control of Lebanon and its government, and was in a state of war with the Gulf kingdom.

But since Mr. Hariri’s resignation, the Saudis have faced a growing backlash from some of their onetime Lebanese Sunni allies who have been venting anger at the kingdom.

Saudi Arabia’s efforts to use Mr. Hariri to undermine Hezbollah in Lebanon were having the opposite of their intended effect, said Simon Henderson, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman “is doing a power play in multiple directions, but in this case in the direction of Lebanon and he appears to think that he can deal a blow to Iran in Lebanon by making Hariri resign,” he said. “To my way of thinking, rather than that he is abdicating the residual Saudi power in Lebanon and bequeathing Lebanon to Iran.”

Saudi Arabia is locked in a regional power struggle with Iran that plays out in the wars in Iraq and Syria, in Lebanese domestic politics and particularly in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is fighting Iran-backed rebels.

In a bid to de-escalate the crisis over the past few weeks, U.S. and European leaders warned all parties against using Lebanon as a battleground for regional proxy wars.

Under Prince Mohammed’s leadership, the kingdom has shifted from a traditionally passive foreign policy to an aggressive one, largely focused on curbing the influence of Iran and its allies. But the Saudis at times have miscalculated the power of their adversaries and the consequences of their own actions, to the chagrin of allies, Western officials and observers say.

Saudi Arabia launched a war in Yemen in the spring <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2015 to</span> restore to power the country’s internationally recognized president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, after he was ousted by Houthi rebels aligned with Iran.

At the time, the military intervention received broad international backing. But as the war dragged on and humanitarian costs mounted, the public mood in Saudi Arabia and abroad soured.

In the celebrations on Wednesday in Beirut, a number of Mr. Hariri’s supporters showed some love for Saudi Arabia by waving the kingdom’s flag alongside the banners of Lebanon and the prime minister’s political party—the Future Movement. Supporters marching in the streets downtown chanted “Saad! Saad! Saad!”

Outside his home, a few even said they were ready to die for Mr. Hariri’s sake.

“We were crying before. We love him so much! He is everything to us,” said Nabila Khodor, a Sunni resident of Beirut in the crowd. “The Saudis forced him to resign but we are with him come what may.”

Mr. Hariri was in tears as he surveyed the crowd, flanked by an aunt who hugged him closely. The two held hands and triumphantly raised them as the crowd roared its approval. Mr. Hariri then took a selfie with the masses, who jostled to fit into the frame.

Mr. Hariri returned to the warm welcome in Lebanon late Tuesday. The highway from the airport to the center of Beirut, which cuts through a Hezbollah stronghold in the city’s southern suburbs, was lined with huge posters of the prime minister bearing the slogan, “We are all with you.” Normally the road is bedecked with pictures of Hezbollah’s leaders and Iranian officials.

Upon his arrival, Mr. Hariri went straight to the grave of his father Rafiq Hariri, a visit that was broadcast live on television. His father was assassinated by a bomb as he drove through Beirut <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2005.</span>

A tribunal formed after his death accused a number of senior Hezbollah members and issued warrants for their arrest. But Hezbollah has refused to hand the officials over and Lebanese authorities never pursued the charge.

The killing prompted mass protests that forced the withdrawal of Syrian military forces that had occupied Lebanon for nearly three decades. In addition to Hezbollah, Iran is a key source of power behind Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.

Updated <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 11,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018 5</span>:11 pm ET

WASHINGTON—Federal Reserve officials at their meeting last month expressed greater confidence inflation would rise to <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">their 2% target</span></span> over the coming year, a development that could affect how much they raise interest rates in coming years.

</span><span id=""1"" class=""red"">They also debated the costs and benefits of allowing the economy to run hot and discussed how they might need to later raise rates to a level that would deliberately slow growth, according to minutes of their March 20-21 meeting, which were released Wednesday.

</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">The minutes highlight just how much Fed officials’ outlook has changed since last fall, when surprisingly slow inflation raised questions about the need for continued rate increases.

</span><span id=""3"" class=""red"">Fed officials last month believed the economy would run hot, or grow faster than its sustainable rate, for the next few years, the minutes said.

</span><span id=""4"" class=""red"">In March, “all participants agreed that the outlook for the economy beyond the current quarter had strengthened in recent months,” the minutes said.</span> <span id=""5"" class=""red"">In addition, “all participants expected inflation on a 12-month basis to move up in coming months.”

</span><span id=""6"" class=""red"">The outlook has shifted since late last year because Congress and the White House approved tax cuts and a boost in federal government spending for this year and next.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">The economy hasn’t often had such fiscal stimulus when unemployment is so low.

</span><span id=""8"" class=""red"">Last year, falling unemployment supported the case for rate increases.</span> <span id=""9"" class=""red"">The jobless rate has held <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 4.1% since</span> last October, near an 18-year low.

</span><span id=""10"" class=""red"">But inflation pressures softened last year, bolstering arguments in favor of slowing the pace of rate rises.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">At the time, top Fed officials said they expected the slowdown would prove transitory, and inflation pressures have firmed up in recent months.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">Officials noted the potential benefits of letting the economy run hot, such as drawing more Americans into the workforce from the sidelines and speeding inflation’s return toward the central bank’<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s 2% goal</span>.</span> <span id=""13"" class=""red"">The policy makers also noted potential costs: “An overheated economy could result in significant inflation pressure or lead to financial instability,” the minutes said.

</span><span id=""14"" class=""red"">The Fed seeks to keep inflation <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 2% because</span> it views that level as consistent with an economy with healthy demand for goods and services.

</span>At the same time, some officials warned they eventually could need to lift rates to a level that would deliberately restrict growth.

<span id=""15"" class=""red"">Some officials said they might need to acknowledge in future postmeeting policy statements that interest rates eventually would rise from a low level that spurs growth “to being a neutral or restraining factor for economic activity,” the minutes said.

</span><span id=""16"" class=""red"">After holding its benchmark federal-funds rate near zero for seven years, the Fed has raised it six times since <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">late 2015,</span> most recently last month to a range <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between 1.5% and</span><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1.75%.</span></span> Officials also penciled in two more quarter-percentage-point rate increases <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2018 and</span> three such moves <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2019.</span>

<span id=""17"" class=""red"">The Fed isn’t likely to raise rates at its next meeting, May 1-2, but investors largely expect another quarter-percentage-point increase at the following meeting in June.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">Investors have focused more attention on whether the Fed will feel pressure to add a fourth rate increase this year.</span> <span id=""19"" class=""red"">The answer largely turns on inflation.

</span><span id=""20"" class=""red"">Of <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 15 Fed</span> officials at March’s meeting,<span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 12 penciled</span> in either three or four rate increases <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for<span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2018,</span></span> and they were equally divided between those two paths.</span> Most officials also penciled in at least three rate increases <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 2019.</span>

<span id=""21"" class=""red"">If Fed officials grow more confident that inflation is rising toward <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">their 2% target</span></span> over time, they could stick to their tentative plan for three rate increases this year.</span> <span id=""22"" class=""red"">But if it looks like new federal spending, tax cuts, a weaker dollar and lower unemployment will lead to an acceleration in price pressures, policy makers could act more aggressively.

</span><span id=""23"" class=""red"">Consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy items <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">rose 2.1% in</span> March from a year earlier, according to the so-called core consumer-price index, released by the Labor Department Wednesday.</span> That was the strongest reading since <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">February 2017.</span>

<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Economists at JPMorgan Chase estimate the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, produced by the Commerce Department, will show annual core inflation <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1.9% in</span> March when it is released later this month.</span> In February, it <span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 1.6%.</span>

<span id=""25"" class=""red"">Annual inflation is expected to rise in coming months because the weak monthly readings of last March and April will no longer be included in year-over-year comparisons, the minutes said.

</span>This upturn is “widely expected and, by itself, would not justify a change in the projected path for the federal-funds rate,” the minutes said.

<span id=""26"" class=""red"">While the minutes show Fed officials are optimistic about economic growth, the prospect of trade fights loomed as one significant concern.

</span><span id=""27"" class=""red"">“A strong majority” of Fed officials saw the prospect of retaliatory trade actions by other countries as a risk for the U.S. economy, the minutes said.</span> <span id=""28"" class=""red"">Officials’ contacts in the agriculture industry reported “feeling particularly vulnerable to retaliation.”

Betsy Wade, First Woman to Edit News at The Times, Dies <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">at 91
In</span> a 45-year Times career, she also became the first woman to lead the Newspaper Guild of New York and fought a sex discrimination case against the paper.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">Betsy Wade, the first woman to edit news copy for The New York Times and the lead plaintiff in a landmark sex discrimination lawsuit against the newspaper on behalf of its female employees, died on Thursday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.</span> She <span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">was 91.</span>
Her death was confirmed by her husband, James Boylan, who said she had learned <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2017 that</span> she had colon cancer.
In a 45-year Times career, Ms. Wade also became the first woman to lead the Newspaper Guild of New York, the largest local in the national journalism union (now known as the NewsGuild).
She was revered among peers for her role in <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">the 1974 class</span>-action suit against The Times, one of the industry’s earliest fights over women’s rights to equal treatment in hiring, promotion, pay and workplace protections under federal anti-discrimination laws.
<span id=""1"" class=""red"">Four years after being fired as a reporter for The New York Herald Tribune for being pregnant, Ms. Wade landed at The Times on Oct.<span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1,</span><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1956,</span></span> and instantly broke a 105-year-old practice of male copy editing in the news department, where women were rare, relatively underpaid and relegated largely to reporting on fashions, cooking and other “women’s news,” or to clerical or secretarial jobs.
</span>“The copy desk did not put a screen around me,” Ms. Wade told Nan Robertson for her book “The Girls in the Balcony” (1992), about the rise of women at The Times. “But they took the cuspidors out of the city room the first week. A copy boy got some deep ruffling and put it around my paste pot.” And the men told clean jokes, she said, “to make me feel less like a temperance worker at a brewery picnic.”
Ms. Wade, still a trainee, enjoyed only a month on The Times’s city news copy desk before she, too, was assigned to edit women’s news. She was too good to be sidetracked, however, and <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 1958 she</span> was back in general news.
She was soon recognized for her cool appraisals of articles and her deft pencil — invisible to readers, but all too apparent to colleagues — as her surgical excisions and repairs saved The Times from factual errors and its writers from clumsy sentences, phrases of dubious taste and embarrassing flaws in grammar, spelling and syntax.
And her headlines — the icing on the cake for a copy editor — were often extraordinary, like one on <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">April 9,</span><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1962,</span> over twinned stories datelined Moscow and Tokyo, in which she rendered “Spring” in Russian, Japanese and English to universalize celebrations of the vernal equinox.
<span id=""2"" class=""red"">She later moved up to jobs with more responsibility, and to other firsts by a woman at The Times: the first to edit articles by foreign correspondents; the first deputy chief of the foreign copy desk; and, <span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1972,</span> the first chief of the foreign copy desk, a job called “the slot” in news jargon — the boss who traditionally sat inside a U-shaped desk and distributed tasks to subordinate copy editors around its rim.
</span>The slot was often a steppingstone to upper management. But the newspaper’s house organ, Times Talk, proclaimed her promotion with a sexist idiom: “Betsy’s in the slot: first dame to make it.”
A year earlier she had been entrusted to help prepare the Pentagon Papers, classified documents and explanatory articles that told of American duplicity in Vietnam, for publication. In a historic ruling for freedom of the press, the Supreme Court denied a Nixon administration challenge. The Times won a Pulitzer Prize for publishing the papers.
She joined a women’s caucus <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1972 to</span> study gender issues at The Times. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">It found that weekly salaries for women <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">were $59 less</span> than those of men with comparable jobs; that there were no women in top corporate or masthead ranks, on the editorial board or <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">among 22 national</span> correspondents; and that the staffs <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 33 foreign</span> correspondents <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">and 35 Washington</span> bureau members included only three women each.
</span><span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1978,</span></span> after a four-year court fight, The Times and representatives <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 560 women</span> on <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 6,000</span>-member staff settled a class-action suit — titled Elizabeth Boylan, et al, v. The New York Times, using Ms. Wade’s married name (she went by Betsy Wade professionally) — on terms approved by Judge Henry Werker. Both sides claimed victory.
<span id=""4"" class=""red"">The Times agreed to place more women in jobs ranging from entry level to top management, and to create annuities covering costs of “delayed career advancement or denied opportunity.”</span> But it did not grant raises or admit any violations of law. James C. Goodale, The Times’s executive vice president at the time, called the paper’s voluntary affirmative action program “one of the strongest in the country.”
Ms. Wade countered: “If Judge Werker is now able to say that The Times has progressed in affirmative action, it is our suit that compelled this. The paper began to move toward our goals when the suit went to court, and the women who have been hired since are aware of this.”
Elizabeth Wade was born in Manhattan on <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">July 18,</span><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1929,</span> to Sidney and Elizabeth (Manning) Wade. Her father was an executive with Union Carbide. Seeking better schools for Betsy and her younger sister, the family moved to suburban Bronxville, N.Y., <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1934.</span>
Envisioning a journalism career, Betsy worked for student newspapers at Bronxville High School, from which she graduated <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1947,</span> and Carleton College in Northfield, Minn. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">She transferred to Barnard College in Manhattan <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1949,</span> earning a bachelor’s degree <span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1951.</span></span> A year later, she received a master’s degree from the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University.
<span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1952,</span> she married Mr. Boylan, who founded The Columbia Journalism Review <span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1961.</span> They had two sons, Richard and Benjamin. They survive her, along with six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
Ms. Wade began her journalism career on The Herald Tribune’s women’s page. After her dismissal, she wrote for the Newspaper Enterprise Association <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 1954 to</span><span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 1956,</span></span> when she joined The Times. <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1978,</span></span> she was elected to a four-year term as president of the New York Newspaper Guild.
<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">In 1987,</span> after three decades as a copy editor, she took over The Times’s Practical Traveler column, and <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">for 14 years</span>, until her retirement <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2001,</span> wrote weekly tips-for-travelers articles.

Ms. Wade was also a board member of the Anne O’Hare McCormick Memorial Fund, which endows scholarships for women at the Columbia and CCNY journalism schools.
Since the 19th century, Times articles had identified men in secondary references as “Mr.” and women as “Mrs.” or “Miss.” Stuck with the double standard, reporters asking female interviewees if they were married or single were often told to get lost.

Midwestern grocery chain Schnuck Markets Inc. announced Thursday that its partnership with Instacart for online delivery will extend to most of <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""49"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">its 100 stores</span></span> by next month. <span id=""2"" class=""red"">Ahold Delhaize’s Peapod is expanding its push into New York City, a key market, after spending more <span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than $94 million</span> on a warehouse in Jersey City, N.J., <span id=""30"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2014.</span>

</span>Shipt, which delivers food orders for retailers including Costco Wholesale Corp., Meijer Inc. and Whole Foods, intends to almost double its markets by next year, <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 51 to</span><span id=""32"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 100.</span> Founder Bill Smith says the company’s expansion is targeting suburban customers in less-saturated regions like the South and the Midwest to gain an edge.

The largest U.S. food sellers, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kroger Co., meanwhile, are testing delivery services using Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc.

It isn’t clear whether Amazon acquiring Whole Foods will remake grocery shopping in the way the company transformed book-buying.

<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Concentrated in cities and surrounding suburbs, grocery delivery is still a small business, accounting for less <span id=""33"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 2% of</span> last year’<span id=""34"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">s $715 billion</span> in food-retail sales, according to food-services research and consulting firm Technomic Inc.</span> Amazon already makes up more than half of online food orders through its Fresh, Prime and Prime Now services.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">Seventy percent of respondents to a survey by supply-chain consulting company AlixPartners LLP last year said they had no intention of having groceries delivered.</span> Grace Herrera, a 59-year-old caregiver in California, said she would rather spend time shopping than pay extra for delivery. “I have time to go to the store,” she said.

Margins also remain an issue. <span id=""5"" class=""red"">Razor-thin to begin with, they have dropped in recent years as falling food costs sparked a price war.</span> And in the online world, the learning curve for how to sell fresh foods has created an added drain.

<span id=""6"" class=""red"">Ocado Group PLC, the biggest online grocer in the U.K. and one of the few public ones, posted its first full-year profit in its fiscal year ended in <span id=""35"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">November 2014 and</span> averages transaction sizes <span id=""36"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of $140 per</span> order, compared <span id=""37"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">with $32 for</span> the typical brick-and-mortar supermarket, according to Barclays Capital Inc. But <span id=""38"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""><span id=""48"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 30% of</span></span> Ocado’s fresh produce is wasted daily, a drag on margins and far worse than a traditional grocer’s average <span id=""39"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 3%,</span> the firm found.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">An Ocado spokeswoman dismissed the Barclays estimate, saying spoilage amounts <span id=""40"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 0.7% of</span> annual sales and that the company is an industry leader in reducing food waste.

</span>Still, delivery is one of the fastest-growing segments of an otherwise sluggish supermarket sector. <span id=""8"" class=""red"">Online sales of consumables grew <span id=""41"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 21% in</span><span id=""42"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2015,</span> according to the Willard Bishop grocery consulting firm.

</span>The planned partnership between Amazon and Whole Foods is a new challenge for delivery services vying for that growth, said Bill Bishop, co-founder of Brick Meets Click, an e-commerce grocery consulting firm. Whole Foods’<span id=""43"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 466 stores</span> could serve as mini-distribution centers in densely populated, affluent areas. <span id=""9"" class=""red"">Amazon, which has demonstrated a willingness to forgo profits for years to build up market share, could use its e-commerce prowess to cut the specialty grocer’s prices to near those of its competitors.

</span>“This gives them another way to drive up penetration in grocery purchasing and ultimately delivery,” Mr. Bishop said.

<span id=""10"" class=""red"">Peapod executives say that being owned by a large retailer like Netherlands-based Ahold Delhaize allows the delivery service to bargain with suppliers for lower prices.</span> They add that Peapod is profitable in markets where it has operated for at least a decade.

“We are the original online grocers and have outlasted many of the competitors who have come and gone,” said Jennifer Carr-Smith, chief executive of the Skokie, Ill.,-based company, which was founded <span id=""44"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 1989 and</span> took its first orders by fax.

FreshDirect didn’t respond to requests for comment.

<span id=""11"" class=""red"">Brick-and-mortar supermarkets are wrestling with whether to invest in their own delivery services, cede profits to startups or risk losing more business to Amazon.</span> For grocers who use Amazon Prime to deliver to their customers, the Whole Foods deal presents a particular challenge.

<span id=""12"" class=""red"">Natural health-food chain Sprouts Farmers Markets Inc. will continue to use Prime to deliver groceries for now, said Bradley Lukow, chief financial officer for the Phoenix-based company.</span> “We’ll make the determination going forward if we want to make any changes,” he said at an industry conference last week.

Schnuck chief marketing officer Andrew Nadin said the grocery chain was planning to expand its partnership with Instacart even before Amazon set out to buy Whole Foods.

“We’ve never tried to out-Wal-Mart Wal-Mart. We won’t try to out-Amazon Amazon,” he said.

Instacart, founded by a former Amazon engineer, aims to be able to deliver <span id=""45"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 80% of</span> U.S. households next year, up <span id=""46"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">from 69% today</span>. <span id=""13"" class=""red"">In addition to stores like Wegmans Food Market Inc. and Target Corp., Instacart currently handles deliveries for Whole Foods.</span> Analysts expect that to end.

Instacart wouldn’t comment on its partnership with Whole Foods.

<span id=""14"" class=""red"">“Amazon is here,” said Nilam Ganenthiran, Instacart’s chief business officer.</span> <span id=""15"" class=""red"">“Grocery retail is going to have to respond.”

65c7cc028f76694c5125d22b,18997,"<h3>‘Death to the Dictator! Death to Rouhani!’: Thousands Protest the Government in Iran</h3>Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Iran over the past few days, speaking out against both the “hardline” government of the ayatollahs and the supposedly “moderate” secular government of President Hassan Rouhani.
“Death to the dictator!” and “Death to Rouhani” are chants heard in at least eight Iranian cities, and the movement appears to be spreading.
The UK Daily Mail reports protesters surrounding an Iranian mullah, a powerful member of the theocratic ruling class, and changing “Mullahs, be ashamed and leave Iran!” in his face.
One of the big protests was held in Mashhad, which is considered one of the holiest sites in Iran and in all of Shia Islam, as it contains the shrine of a revered 9th Century imam.
On Friday afternoon there were reports of protesters filling the streets of Qom, Iran’s spiritual center, and chanting: “We don’t want an Islamic republic!” Another protest chant, “Iran is haphazard without the Shah,” seems calculated to annoy the mullahs and ayatollah. These are remarkable gestures of defiance against Iran and the revolution <span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 1979,</span> which is officially regarded as a sacred event.
One brave woman expressed her defiance by standing up without a veil or headscarf:

Iran</span>’s military and foreign adventures are a major cause of the protesters’ anger, which is remarkable considering how hard the Iranian government has worked to portray its interventions as sacred causes and military leaders like Quds Force commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani as national heroes.
And yet, the protesters cry “Not Gaza! Not Lebanon! My life for Iran!” and “Leave Syria, think about us!” They are even criticizing the Iranian government’s activism on behalf of the Palestinians.
<span id=""0"" class=""red"">The initial cause of the protests was reportedly public anger over rising prices for food, a generally high inflation rate, and high unemployment.</span> <span id=""1"" class=""red"">The governor of Mashhad dismissed the protest in his city as an “illegal No to High Prices gathering” at first.
</span><span id=""2"" class=""red"">Rouhani campaigned on economic renewal, including the benefits accruing to Iran from its nuclear deal with the Obama administration, and while progress has certainly been made – Iran’s inflation rate is a little <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">under 10 percent</span> today, compared to <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 40 percent</span> when Rouhani took over from his deranged predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad – the crowd appears to be profoundly dissatisfied with the standard of living, and displeased that Iran is funneling so much money into foreign mischief and imperial ambitions instead of meeting the public’s needs at home.</span> Despite Rouhani’s promises, the standard of living for average Iranians has declined <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 30 percent</span> over the past ten years.
<span id=""3"" class=""red"">Corruption and mismanagement of vital resources have also been proposed as reasons for the protest, combined with a debt crisis choking the Iranian banking sector.
</span>Iranian officials, including the governor of Mashhad, gave their police forces much credit for a “tolerant” response at first, but tolerance quickly thinned as the mullahs demanded a stronger crackdown.
Meanwhile, Rouhani allies are floating conspiracy theories that the hardliners are behind the protests, in a bid to weaken Iran’s “secular” government and increase theocratic power. “When a social and political movement is launched on the streets, those who started it will not necessarily be able to control it in the end,” Rouhani ally and Vice-President Eshaq Jahangiri reportedly said.
The Daily Mail has photos of tear gas in the streets:
Protesters threw stones as water cannon came out in the city of Kermanshah, according to footage from members of the anti-Ayatollah group the National Council of Resistance in Iran (NCRI):

<span id=""5"" class=""red"">The protests reached Tehran on Friday as the movement gained support from workers upset by unpaid back wages.</span> The crowd in Tehran was small, estimated at <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 50 people</span>. Several arrests were nevertheless reported, perhaps intended as a warning shot against Tehran residents tempted to join in.
A storm of viral videos and photographs is rising on social media. Iranian dissidents are talking about an “uprising” that may be more significant than the “Green Revolution” <span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 2009,</span> and perhaps more difficult for the government to suppress with violence, especially since some of the demonstrators have indicated a willingness to fight back, or to stand their ground in the face of police and militia action.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s response to the protests has been uncharacteristically subdued, leading some to sense weakness or cowardice in the face of public demands for accountable government.

<span id=""0"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">June 14,</span><span id=""1"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2012 1</span>:39 pm ET

QINGDAO, China—Shopping for a water heater at Jiangsu Five Star Appliance, first-time homeowner Zhong Lei listens intently as a salesman explains how a digital-control system makes taking a shower more comfortable.

<span id=""0"" class=""red"">""We need to learn about all these features because our parents didn't have most of this stuff,"" Mr. Zhong, a 31-year-old military employee, explains later.

</span>He buys the water heater—as well as a refrigerator, a washing machine and <span id=""2"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">a $950 flat</span>-screen television set.

Mr. Zhong's experience at the Best Buy Co. <span id=""3"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">BBY 1.58</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle unit offers a glimpse inside China's evolving middle class.

<span id=""1"" class=""red"">China is counting on rising domestic demand from this rapidly growing segment.</span> <span id=""2"" class=""red"">So, too, are Western exporters, faced with anemic growth in Europe and North America.

</span>But China's middle class isn't Charleston's. <span id=""3"" class=""red"">Western companies have misjudged Chinese shoppers' priorities and clumsily tried to export U.S.-style stores.

</span>""We were stupid and arrogant,"" says David Deno, who was Best Buy's Asia chief until recently.

<span id=""4"" class=""red"">But through trial and error, China has become a rare bright spot for Best Buy, which has been pummeled by slumping U.S. sales and racked by management turmoil culminating with the April resignation of its chief executive.

</span><span id=""5"" class=""red"">The company is betting that its Five Star subsidiary can make China the retailer's largest overseas market, one that could rival U.S. operations.</span> <span id=""6"" class=""red"">Five Star has <span id=""4"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about 200 stores</span> and <span id=""5"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2016 plans</span> to add up <span id=""6"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 500 more</span>, <span id=""7"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">targeting $4 billion</span> in sales.</span> <span id=""7"" class=""red"">Five Star declines to disclose last year's sales.

</span>The potential buying power of China's middle class is vast. <span id=""8"" class=""red""><span id=""8"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 247 million</span> Chinese,<span id=""9"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 18.2% of</span> the population, qualify as middle class, meaning their households spend <span id=""10"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">between $10 and</span><span id=""11"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> $100 a</span> day on average, according to Brookings Institution economist Homi Kharas.

</span><span id=""9"" class=""red"">If current patterns continue, the number will soar <span id=""12"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">to 607 million</span> <span id=""13"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">by 2020,</span> and spending by China's middle class will rival that of the U.S., after adjusting for inflation and purchasing power.

</span>The trend has the potential to remake China. <span id=""10"" class=""red"">With export markets weakening in Europe and the U.S., economists say, Beijing needs to lift spending by its own middle class or risk that growth will slow sharply.</span> <span id=""11"" class=""red"">Steady middle-class growth also could help China's trading partners, bolstering a market for computers, cars and trendy clothing, as well as for commodities such as copper, oil and cotton.

</span><span id=""12"" class=""red"">China already is the world's largest market for some middle-class emblems, including cars, personal computers and smartphones.</span> And multinational companies show no signs of taking their feet off the gas. Whirlpool Corp. <span id=""14"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">WHR 0.69</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle plans to boost distribution of fridges, washing machines and other appliances to China's inland cities. Coca-Cola Co. <span id=""15"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">KO 0.09</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle plans to <span id=""16"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">invest $4 billion</span> over the next three years.

<span id=""13"" class=""red"">""For fast-moving, everyday consumer goods, there are some broad megatrends that will continue to push demand forward, which are ongoing urbanization in China and then, of course, the related growth of the middle class,"" Hein Schumacher, the China chief for food maker H.J. Heinz Co., told analysts last month.

</span>Nicolas Wang, Five Star's chief executive, says that when the company opened its first store <span id=""17"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2001,</span> he didn't even know the Chinese term for middle class. <span id=""14"" class=""red"">It's no wonder; less <span id=""18"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 3% of</span> the population fit the description then, says Mr. Kharas, the Brookings economist.

</span>But many retailers jumped in anyway. Some quickly prospered, such as Yum Brands Inc.'s YUM -1.91%decrease; red down pointing triangle KFC.

Mattel Inc., MAT -1.52%decrease; red down pointing triangle however, shut its Barbie stores in March of last year, after learning that Chinese parents wanted their girls to model themselves after studious children, not flirts.

Home Depot Inc. <span id=""15"" class=""red""><span id=""19"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">HD 2.18</span>%increase; green up pointing triangle closed about half its stores here last year, finding scant interest among Chinese for do-it-yourself renovation.</span> Mattel says it will promote more educational toys in China. Home Depot is revamping its strategy.

Best Buy used a two-track approach. It bought an <span id=""20"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">initial 75% stake</span> in Five Star <span id=""21"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">in 2006.</span> It also opened nine Best Buy stores, figuring that Chinese shoppers would covet the same gadgets Americans did, like espresso machines and surround-sound home-entertainment systems.

But Chinese consumers are different. For one thing, they are poorer. <span id=""16"" class=""red"">Median household income in Chinese cities was <span id=""22"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">about $13,400 in</span><span id=""23"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 2010,</span> according to Moody's Analytics, about a quarter the U.S. figure.

</span>The Chinese middle class also is at a different stage of development. Many Chinese want appliances and basic TV sets to fill their first apartments. <span id=""17"" class=""red"">Chinese on average also save more <span id=""24"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">than 30% of</span> household income, vastly more than Americans, and rarely use credit cards.</span> <span id=""18"" class=""red"">And many Chinese shoppers expect to haggle over prices—a foreign concept for the U.S. company.

</span>Last year, Best Buy shut its China outlets, figuring that opening U.S.-style stores had been a mistake, and focused exclusively on building the Five Star brand.

<span id=""19"" class=""red"">Five Star targets China's lesser-known cities, where some people are just beginning to develop consumer habits.</span> <span id=""20"" class=""red""><span id=""25"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">About 70% of</span> its customers are young families earning <span id=""26"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">around 5,000 yuan</span>, or <span id=""27"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">roughly $800,</span> a month and looking for products that a decade ago only the rich could afford.

</span><span id=""21"" class=""red"">The moment a customer starts browsing a big-ticket item, a Five Star sales clerk will offer the shopper cherry tomatoes, a cup of hot water to sip or some time in a massage chair.</span> Later, the clerk will try to persuade the customer to buy the chair.

The chain also offers the services of ""solution experts,"" who help customers sort through the conflicting claims of manufacturers' representatives who work in the stores, where goods are organized by manufacturer, rather than by product.

Five Star's experts give out their telephone numbers so customers can call at any time. The goal is to build a web of loyal shoppers through referrals, borrowing from a Chinese custom of relying on a network of trusted acquaintances for advice.

One Five Star shopping expert, Wang Bo, says he has been invited to a half-dozen customer weddings. ""I earn their trust and give them the smile and service of an angel,"" he says.

Growing sophistication among some Chinese middle-class customers has led Five Star to upgrade in some cities. <span id=""22"" class=""red"">The Qingdao store has higher-priced electronics than older outlets—for example, cameras and high-definition video equipment for a first voyage overseas or a road trip across China.

</span>With brighter lighting, additional seating and customer-assistance stations, the store in this port city <span id=""28"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 8.4 million</span> people also has more of the trappings of a stateside Best Buy.

Best Buy also is giving Five Star a few tips from the U.S. playbook. The subsidiary displays mobile phones, which Chinese consumers regularly upgrade, in the front of the store to draw traffic.

Five Star also is working to develop its own brand as a retailer, helping it to compete with larger, brand-conscious Chinese chains, such as Suning Appliance Co.<span id=""29"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);""> 002024 </span>-1.47%decrease; red down pointing triangle and GOME Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. <span id=""23"" class=""red"">493 -3.67%decrease; red down pointing triangle

Following its parent's lead, Five Star opened a small research department last year to conduct consumer surveys.</span> When it learned that some customers considered the chain stodgy, Five Star developed a new icon: cartoon characters that appear to be drawn by Hollywood animators.

<span id=""24"" class=""red"">Tan Peng and her fiancé, Hou Huimao, have a combined monthly income <span id=""31"" class=""yellow"" onclick=""annotateQuant(this);"">of 4,000 yuan</span>.</span> On a recent visit to Five Star's Qingdao outlet, they purchased a washing machine, a refrigerator and a flat-screen TV for their new two-bedroom apartment.

On their way out, the 28-year-olds stop to pore over an iPad but decide the time isn't right.

""We have to go to where we can get the best bargains,"" Ms. Tan says. ""After all, we're not in the upper class.""
