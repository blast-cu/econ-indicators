43627_16,"Henry McMaster (R) called the extra benefits a “dangerous federal entitlement, incentivizing and paying workers to stay at home rather than encouraging them to return to the workplace.”
Republicans have always said jobless pay discourages work, and businesses always complain they can’t find enough workers willing to accept their wages, but the complaints have been supercharged by the unprecedented federal support ― Congress has never added hundreds of dollars to weekly benefits before ― and the rush to reopen businesses as vaccines spur a return to normalcy. GOP lawmakers blamed the added benefits for a disappointing jobs report Friday that showed employers added <span>only 266,000 jobs</span> in April, far fewer than economists predicted, with the jobless rate ticking up to 6.1%. “While there are certainly people that needed access to increased unemployment benefits during the heart of this pandemic, we should not be in the business of creating lucrative government dependency that makes it more beneficial to stay unemployed rather than return to work,” Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) said in a statement on Friday, accusing the Biden administration of causing a “government imposed labor shortage.”
Marshall said he planned to introduce legislation next week that would repeal enhanced unemployment benefits nationwide."

Trump’<span>s $1 trillion</span> stimulus is a gamble for reelection — and a sea change for Republicans once opposed to bailouts
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has offered his own plan, which skews more toward workers than corporations.

The outlet blamed Washington for sending the rial into a “tailspin” and prices of basic goods in the country “through the roof.”
The administration of President Donald Trump walked out of the nuclear deal, formally the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), after collecting significant evidence that Iran was violating the provisions of the deal and using its windfall from sanctions relief to fund Hezbollah, support Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and spread the influence of Shiite terrorist organizations throughout the Middle East and Latin America."

Updated Aug. 23, 2015 2:10 pm ET

Fresh jitters about the global economy are giving U.S. government bonds an unexpected boost, once again upending bets by investors who were convinced the three-decade-long rally in Treasurys was over. The scramble for the safety of Treasurys—amid broader financial-market turmoil spurred by worries about the slowdown in China—has sent the yield on the benchmark 10-year note back <span>toward 2%,</span> its lowest since April.
