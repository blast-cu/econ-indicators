Government forecasters in the U.S., Australia and Japan have in recent weeks confirmed El Niño is back for the first time since the 2009-10 farming season, thanks to <span>a 4% temperature</span> rise in subsurface sea temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

By loosening spending caps and extending various tax breaks, the agreement means that combined federal, state and local spending and taxes will contribute to growth this year for the first time since 2010."
49071_4,"That rule went out the window in 2011 when Republicans in Congress and President Barack Obama enacted multiyear spending limits when they couldn’t agree on long-term changes to spending and taxes.

The hit to the economy was all the harder because the Federal Reserve couldn’t compensate by cutting interest rates, since they already were near zero."
