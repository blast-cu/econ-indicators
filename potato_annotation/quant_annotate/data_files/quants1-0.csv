But what set off debate that day was Mr. Fabrizio’s finding that more <span>than 70 percent</span> of voters in the states being targeted by the campaign supported mandatory mask wearing in public, at least indoors, including a majority of Republicans. Mr. Kushner, who along with Hope Hicks, another top adviser, had been trying for months to convince Mr. Trump that masks could be portrayed as the key to regaining freedom to go safely to a restaurant or a sporting event, called embracing mask-wearing a “no-brainer.” Mr. Kushner had some reason for optimism."

The situation in the occupied south is more complicated."

The U.S. intelligence assessment that referendums could be held as soon as this weekend has led many observers in Ukraine, Washington and Brussels to suspect that Russia is attempting to create a bulwark against a long-expected Ukrainian counteroffensive by annexing territory and solidifying Russian control on the ground."

Teenagers were once again kicking soccer balls around grassy areas now dotted with blackened circles where thousands of families had recently been cooking meals."

The oil pouring out of U.S. fields was so much cheaper—more <span>than $20 a</span> barrel below international benchmark prices at times—that refineries were eager to pay higher rail shipping costs in exchange for some of it. New pipelines have helped shrink that price difference by allowing the landlocked oil to reach market."
23424_33,Phillips 66 said earlier this year it may still be cheaper to take that oil and put it on a barge for delivery by sea to the coasts than to send it directly there by train. Write to Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com and Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com -<span> 117 </span>- - - - -

73533_0,"Interest-Rate Cuts, Asset Purchases Ricochet Through Foreign-Exchange Markets; ‘Unspoken Currency War Has Broken Out’  Updated Feb.<span> 8,</span> 2015 7:28 pm ET  The central-bank stimulus spree of 2015 has the look of a global currency war. In quick succession, countries representing about a third of the world’s economic output—from the eurozone to China, Australia and Canada—have taken steps that have driven down the value of their currencies."
73533_3,"But if it’s a war, it’s a gentle one so far. Half the central banks representing the Group <span>of 20 developed</span> and large emerging economies, whose top monetary and finance officials meet to discuss the global economy this week in Istanbul, have taken easing steps so far this year. The moves—mainly in the form of interest-rate cuts but also asset purchases—have ricocheted through foreign-exchange markets, driving the currencies of some countries down and those of others, primarily the U.S., up."
73533_4,"That helps the economies of countries that are easing while complicating life for some central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, and creating challenges for exporters, from the U.S. to Switzerland and Denmark. “There is a growing consensus in the market that an unspoken currency war has broken out,” David Woo and Vadim Iaralov at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note to clients, noting that the magnitude of currency-market swings this year has hit its highest noncrisis level <span>in 20 years</span>. Mention of currency war evokes images of countries deliberately trying to force their currencies down to boost exports and curb imports at their neighbors’ expense."
73533_5,"As one central bank eases, others are forced to follow suit to offset the upward pressure on their currencies. Unlike past easy-money campaigns, these latest efforts—from economies totaling <span>about $36 trillion</span> in annual output—aren’t aimed at addressing financial crises, as with the U.S.-led global effort six years ago. Rather, central banks are taking aim at the risks of too-low inflation and weak economic growth."
73533_7,"The frenzy of easing policies began in Europe, once a center of conservative central banking with Germany’s Bundesbank at its core. The European Central Bank announced a bond-buying program, mostly government debt, last month that could swell beyond €1 trillion (about $1.13 trillion) by the fall <span>of 2016.</span> That sent a tidal wave through the continent."
11356_17,"Starting in early August 2016, Stone began bragging publicly that he had a way to communicate with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. On Aug.<span> 21,</span> 2016 — six weeks before WikiLeaks published emails stolen from Podesta — Stone tweeted, “Trust me, it will soon the Podesta’s time in the barrel.” The seemingly prescient and imperfectly phrased tweet did not mention WikiLeaks. But it led to suspicions by Podesta and others that Stone had been aware of WikiLeaks’ plans in advance."
11356_23,"[How an ex-madam, a political trickster and a toddler got tangled up in the Russia investigation] They then turned their attention to Corsi, a conservative author who had emailed with Stone about WikiLeaks during the campaign. Corsi,<span> 72,</span> had at one point worked in financial services, but more recently had become a popular writer on the fringe right. He wrote a book in 2004 accusing former secretary of state John F. Kerry of lying about his Vietnam service and then became a leading proponent of the false theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, a topic over which he bonded with Trump."

On Aug.<span> 28,</span> 2018, two FBI agents banged on the door of Corsi’s New Jersey home, a grand jury subpoena in hand — kicking off a byzantine turn in the investigation. After convening with Gray, a New Jersey attorney who had done legal work for his wife’s cleaning business, Corsi decided he would cooperate with prosecutors."
11356_37,"They sought out Corsi’s contacts, looking for anyone who could be a go-between to WikiLeaks. On Oct.<span> 3,</span> 2018, an FBI agent accompanied by a local sheriff’s deputy knocked on the back gate of the home of James and Joanne Moriarty in the Piney Woods, a rural region of eastern Texas. The couple had lived in Libya before the 2011 fall of ruler Moammar Gaddafi and had served as sources for Corsi as he worked on articles about what he felt were the failures of the Obama administration in that country."
11356_43,"“We find what you’re saying is lacking,” Zelinsky added. By their final meeting on Nov.<span> 2,</span> 2018, the prosecutors made their concerns clear. They lectured Corsi for about 20 minutes about the need to stick to definite facts."
64368_0,"On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Don Lemon Tonight,” economist, Harvard Professor, Director of the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama, and Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton Larry Summers said that inflation will not “get that close to <span>the 2% that</span> is the Fed’s central objective.” And that while it’s not for certain, “probably early next year, the most likely thing is that you’ll see the economy will be very substantially slow and perhaps you’ll see a period of negative growth.” Summers stated, “I think what you’re most likely to see is interest rates rise to some point above 3%. I certainly think you’ll see inflation come down from 8%, but I don’t think it’s going to get that close to the 2% that is the Fed’s central objective."

Buzz on the August DC Comics supervillain ensemble film “Suicide Squad,” for example, is better than that of last August’s superhero bomb “Fantastic Four.” If the summer isn’t dominated by a handful of blockbusters, it’s not only upscale audiences who may find more to see at the multiplex."

The S&<span>P 500 is</span> by design not comprehensive, including only big stocks, but if it can exclude such a huge company as Tesla, what is it for? The answer, according to S&P’s website, is that it “is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities.” In the world of investment, that is pretty much all there is: If everyone uses the S&P as the benchmark, you have to pay attention."

Previously, the Swiss were obligated to continuously purchase unlimited quantities of Euros to maintain <span>the 1.20 peg</span> that they decided to implement back in September of 2011. Interestingly, this Euro/Franc peg coincided with the nominal high in gold prices, as the world feared that there were increasingly smaller places to park safe money."
