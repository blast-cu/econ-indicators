But what set off debate that day was Mr. Fabrizio’s finding that more <span>than 70 percent</span> of voters in the states being targeted by the campaign supported mandatory mask wearing in public, at least indoors, including a majority of Republicans. Mr. Kushner, who along with Hope Hicks, another top adviser, had been trying for months to convince Mr. Trump that masks could be portrayed as the key to regaining freedom to go safely to a restaurant or a sporting event, called embracing mask-wearing a “no-brainer.” Mr. Kushner had some reason for optimism."

The situation in the occupied south is more complicated."

The U.S. intelligence assessment that referendums could be held as soon as this weekend has led many observers in Ukraine, Washington and Brussels to suspect that Russia is attempting to create a bulwark against a long-expected Ukrainian counteroffensive by annexing territory and solidifying Russian control on the ground."

23424_33,Phillips 66 said earlier this year it may still be cheaper to take that oil and put it on a barge for delivery by sea to the coasts than to send it directly there by train. Write to Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com and Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com -<span> 117 </span>- - - - -

73533_0,"Interest-Rate Cuts, Asset Purchases Ricochet Through Foreign-Exchange Markets; ‘Unspoken Currency War Has Broken Out’  Updated Feb.<span> 8,</span> 2015 7:28 pm ET  The central-bank stimulus spree of 2015 has the look of a global currency war. In quick succession, countries representing about a third of the world’s economic output—from the eurozone to China, Australia and Canada—have taken steps that have driven down the value of their currencies."
73533_3,"But if it’s a war, it’s a gentle one so far. Half the central banks representing the Group <span>of 20 developed</span> and large emerging economies, whose top monetary and finance officials meet to discuss the global economy this week in Istanbul, have taken easing steps so far this year. The moves—mainly in the form of interest-rate cuts but also asset purchases—have ricocheted through foreign-exchange markets, driving the currencies of some countries down and those of others, primarily the U.S., up."
73533_4,"That helps the economies of countries that are easing while complicating life for some central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, and creating challenges for exporters, from the U.S. to Switzerland and Denmark. “There is a growing consensus in the market that an unspoken currency war has broken out,” David Woo and Vadim Iaralov at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note to clients, noting that the magnitude of currency-market swings this year has hit its highest noncrisis level <span>in 20 years</span>. Mention of currency war evokes images of countries deliberately trying to force their currencies down to boost exports and curb imports at their neighbors’ expense."
73533_5,"As one central bank eases, others are forced to follow suit to offset the upward pressure on their currencies. Unlike past easy-money campaigns, these latest efforts—from economies totaling <span>about $36 trillion</span> in annual output—aren’t aimed at addressing financial crises, as with the U.S.-led global effort six years ago. Rather, central banks are taking aim at the risks of too-low inflation and weak economic growth."
73533_7,"The frenzy of easing policies began in Europe, once a center of conservative central banking with Germany’s Bundesbank at its core. The European Central Bank announced a bond-buying program, mostly government debt, last month that could swell beyond €1 trillion (about $1.13 trillion) by the fall <span>of 2016.</span> That sent a tidal wave through the continent."
11356_17,"Starting in early August 2016, Stone began bragging publicly that he had a way to communicate with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. On Aug.<span> 21,</span> 2016 — six weeks before WikiLeaks published emails stolen from Podesta — Stone tweeted, “Trust me, it will soon the Podesta’s time in the barrel.” The seemingly prescient and imperfectly phrased tweet did not mention WikiLeaks. But it led to suspicions by Podesta and others that Stone had been aware of WikiLeaks’ plans in advance."
11356_23,"[How an ex-madam, a political trickster and a toddler got tangled up in the Russia investigation] They then turned their attention to Corsi, a conservative author who had emailed with Stone about WikiLeaks during the campaign. Corsi,<span> 72,</span> had at one point worked in financial services, but more recently had become a popular writer on the fringe right. He wrote a book in 2004 accusing former secretary of state John F. Kerry of lying about his Vietnam service and then became a leading proponent of the false theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, a topic over which he bonded with Trump."

On Aug.<span> 28,</span> 2018, two FBI agents banged on the door of Corsi’s New Jersey home, a grand jury subpoena in hand — kicking off a byzantine turn in the investigation. After convening with Gray, a New Jersey attorney who had done legal work for his wife’s cleaning business, Corsi decided he would cooperate with prosecutors."
11356_37,"They sought out Corsi’s contacts, looking for anyone who could be a go-between to WikiLeaks. On Oct.<span> 3,</span> 2018, an FBI agent accompanied by a local sheriff’s deputy knocked on the back gate of the home of James and Joanne Moriarty in the Piney Woods, a rural region of eastern Texas. The couple had lived in Libya before the 2011 fall of ruler Moammar Gaddafi and had served as sources for Corsi as he worked on articles about what he felt were the failures of the Obama administration in that country."
11356_43,"“We find what you’re saying is lacking,” Zelinsky added. By their final meeting on Nov.<span> 2,</span> 2018, the prosecutors made their concerns clear. They lectured Corsi for about 20 minutes about the need to stick to definite facts."

21067_8,"Many of them already feel uncomfortable about working with each other, and have made difficult compromises to join forces in order to push Mr. Netanyahu from office. Mr. Lapid himself agreed to give Naftali Bennett, a hard-right former settler leader who opposes Palestinian statehood, the chance to lead the government <span>until 2023,</span> at which point Mr. Lapid will take over.

21067_9,"And with the fate of the new coalition dependent on a narrow margin and hanging on every single vote, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies were on the hunt for potential defectors leading up to the announcement, and signaled that they would continue until the vote of confidence.

21067_13,"Though Yamina did finally join the coalition on Wednesday night, Mr. Netanyahu’s party, Likud, is likely to continue to play on these fears.

His party has already promised to keep goading Ms. Silman and her colleagues."
21067_14,"Still, though the coalition will include several parties that disagree on both those issues, they have agreed to allow Mr. Bennett to become prime minister first. If the coalition deal holds, Mr. Bennett would be replaced for the second part of the four-year term by Mr. Lapid, who advocates for secular, middle-class Israelis and whose party <span>won 17 seats</span>. By conceding the first turn in the rotation, Mr. Lapid, who has been branded as a dangerous leftist by his opponents on the right, smoothed the way for other right-wing politicians to join the new anti-Netanyahu alliance."

Reports and rumors that Moreno sought to evict Assange have circulated repeatedly in the past year, reaching a fever pitch when Assange attempted to file a lawsuit against the Ecuadorian government in October for “violating fundamental rights and freedoms” while he stayed at the embassy."

A spokesperson for the Police Department said they were conducting canvasses of the park but would not comment on why there had been no arrest."

As Trump prepares to run again <span>in 2024,</span> it’s worth reminding ourselves of the lessons we’ve learned — and committing to the principle that, when covering politicians who are essentially running against democracy, old-style journalism will no longer suffice. Back in 2016, I was still looking for common ground with the Trump crowd."

So, I wrote a call to arms for American journalists: “Journalists are going to have to be better — stronger, more courageous, stiffer-spined — than they’ve ever been.” I filed it, not at all convinced that I’d written anything worthwhile on this momentous night, said good night to my editor and headed out of the newsroom <span>around 3 a</span>.m. Stunned and spent, I walked slowly through the deserted streets of downtown Washington."

88455_0,"It’s always been easy to prophesy Hong Kong’s doom. Ever since Britain handed over the bustling colonial entrepôt to Beijing <span>in 1997,</span> prognosticators and politicos of all stripes warned of its inexorable decline. Hong Kong’s liberal and quasi-democratic traditions, including civil liberties such as freedom of speech, would wane and wither under the new Communist overlords, they said."
88455_1,"The legislation’s proponents insist that current legal loopholes — Hong Kong does not have extradition treaties with China or Taiwan — need to be closed. But its critics argue that the bill fundamentally threatens the “one country, two systems” model that has enabled Hong Kong to maintain a degree of political autonomy <span>since 1997.</span> Permitting extraditions to the mainland, they contend, would enable China’s authoritarian leadership to further erode the rule of law and civil liberties in Hong Kong."
88455_4,"Bowing to public pressure, Hong Kong’s lawmakers decided to postpone the debate of the bill. Hanging over the current tensions is the legacy of the Umbrella Movement, the mass pro-democracy protest in 2014 that occupied Hong Kong’s main commercial district <span>for 79 days</span>. Despite galvanizing a new generation of young activists, it achieved little in the way of political change."
88455_5,"Though still Asia’s financial capital, Hong Kong looks tinier and tinier when set against China’s ever-rising colossus. But those among its more <span>than 7 million</span> residents who believe in Hong Kong’s freedoms aren’t going down without a fight. The current standoff has revived the city’s civil society and pro-democracy movement."

88076_2,"Thousands of members and supporters of the Patriotic Union party, formed by FARC and other Colombian communists, were wiped out in the 1980s and '90s by paramilitary gunmen. Still, it will not be hard for the peace deal’s detractors, led by powerful former president Álvaro Uribe, to depict the guarantee <span>of 10 unelected</span> legislative seats as an unconscionable freebie. Colombians who know FARC leaders from grainy “wanted” posters and jungle videos may have trouble accepting them as respectable lawmakers."
88076_5,"“I think the FARC gave some ground when it became clear that too much intransigence would only empower the far right in Colombia,” said Isacson, a security analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America. “They were careful to bend the process, to get what they could, but not break it.” On Oct.<span> 2 the</span> government and the rebels will find out whether they found the right balance, or if their accord will die on arrival."
