39418_0,"King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, who came to the throne in old age and earned a reputation as a cautious reformer even as the Arab Spring revolts toppled heads of state and Islamic State militants threatened the Muslim establishment that he represented, died on Friday, according to a statement on state television. He <span>was 90.</span> The Royal Court said in a statement broadcast across the kingdom that the king had died early Friday."
39418_1,The royal court did not disclose the exact cause of death. An announcement quoted by the official Saudi Press Agency said the king had a lung infection when he was admitted on Dec.<span> 31 to</span> a Riyadh hospital. The king’s death adds yet another element of uncertainty in a region already overwhelmed by crises and as Saudi Arabia is itself in a struggle with Iran for regional dominance.
39418_25,"As king he also bore the title of custodian of Islam’s holiest sites, Mecca and Medina, making him one of the faith’s most important figures. Abdullah had grown accustomed to the levers of power long before his ascension to the throne in August<span> 2005.</span> After his predecessor, King Fahd, a half brother, had a stroke in November 1995, Abdullah, then the crown prince, ruled in the king’s name."
39418_5,"Abdullah’s reign was a constant effort to balance desert traditions with the demands of the modern world, making him appear at times to be shifting from one to the other. When popular movements and insurgencies overthrew or threatened long-established Arab rulers from Tunisia to Yemen <span>in 2011,</span> he reacted swiftly. On his return from three months of treatment for a herniated disk and a blood clot in New York and Morocco, his government spent $130 billion to build 500,000 units of low-income housing, to bolster the salaries of government employees and to ensure the loyalty of religious organizations."
39418_13,"It has been suggested that the changes long resisted by conservative forces — resistance that even a king could not overcome — would one day come about as those men and women rose in the government, industry and academia. Perhaps Abdullah’s most daunting challenge arrived in the wake of the Sept.<span> 11,</span> 2001, terrorist attacks, with the revelation that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis. The royal family at first railed at what it called a vicious smear campaign against the kingdom, then ruthlessly suppressed known militants — not least because the monarchy itself was a main target of Al Qaeda."

39418_24,"He refused to sign any official papers with his own name as long as his stricken brother lived. Fahd died on Aug.<span> 1,</span> 2005. One of King Abdullah’s first official acts was to pardon two Libyans accused of plotting to kill him, a result of Egypt’s engineering a reconciliation between the two nations."
39418_26,"He went on to establish job-training programs to help ease severe unemployment among educated young Saudis, to develop long-wasted natural gas as a commodity that could be exported, and to bring Saudi Arabia into the World Trade Organization. He became the first Saudi head of state to meet a pope, Benedict XVI, <span>in 2007.</span> Although he reaffirmed his kingdom’s longstanding alliance with the United States, tensions arose with events."

While experts said some of the criticism could be wide of the mark, the People’s Bank of China may now have a tough job on its hands to prevent the currency's decline from spiraling."
25786_10,"Many economists agree the currency had become overvalued, and efforts to keep it stable had kept domestic interest rates higher and monetary policy tighter than economic conditions warranted. [What the Chinese devaluation means for the world economy] The yuan hit a four-year low on Wednesday, <span>reaching 6.45 to</span> the dollar within China and as low as 6.59 in international trade. Ironically, Japan and the euro zone have overseen much sharper depreciations in the yen and euro, respectively, this year as part of efforts to stimulate their economies, but they have escaped without the volley of criticism from U.S. politicians that greeted China's decision Tuesday."

25786_15,"Still, the bank will have to keep its “fingers crossed,” said Chen Long, an economist with Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing, who sketched out three scenarios. The worst scenario is that the yuan continues to slide, perhaps <span>toward 7 to</span> the dollar. That would put enormous downward pressure on other Asian currencies, raise a further firestorm of criticism in the United States about efforts to steal American jobs, and give substance to those alarmist “currency war” headlines about nations engaging in competitive devaluations to boost their economies."

In an effort to stabilize that market, the authorities damaged their own standing by taking extreme measures, banning major shareholders from selling shares and launching criminal investigations into “malicious” short-sellers."

55115_0,"Leaders of the world’s wealthiest democracies vowed to end their dependence on Russian energy and ensure that Russia does not triumph in its “unprovoked, unjustifiable and illegal aggression,” as President Vladimir V. Putin pursued his indiscriminate bombardment of eastern Ukraine and orchestrated celebrations for Russia’s Victory Day holiday on Monday. A statement by the Group <span>of 7 major</span> industrialized nations said that on a day when Europe recalled the devastation of World War II and its millions of victims, including those from the Soviet Union, Mr. Putin’s “actions bring shame on Russia and the historic sacrifices of its people.” The leaders, signaling to Mr. Putin that their unrelenting support of Ukraine would only grow, said, “We remain united in our resolve that President Putin must not win his war against Ukraine.” The memory of all those who fought for freedom in World War II, the statement said, obliged them “to continue fighting for it today.” The tone was firm, with no mention of any potential diplomacy or cease-fire. In Moscow, as fighter jets streaked across the sky and nuclear weapons were put on display in preparation for Victory Day, Mr. Putin appeared to signal back to Western leaders that he was determined to double down on the war until he could conjure something that might be claimed as victory."
55115_1,"There was fresh evidence of that on Sunday, as rescuers picked through the rubble in Bilohorivka, a village in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine where a Russian bomb had flattened a school building the day before, killing people sheltering there, local authorities said. “Most likely, <span>all 60 people</span> who remain under the rubble are now dead,” Gov. Serhiy Haidai wrote on the Telegram messaging app."

The Group <span>of 7 leaders</span> said any attempts “to replace democratically elected Ukrainian local authorities with illegitimate ones” would not be recognized. Visits to the region by the first lady, Jill Biden, who crossed into western Ukraine to meet Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, in an unannounced visit to Uzhhorod, and by Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, who appeared unexpectedly in a war-scarred suburb of Kyiv, were clearly intended to drive home a message of unwavering Western commitment."

55115_8,"Canada’s leader, Justin Trudeau, also made an unannounced trip to the Kyiv suburb of Irpin. It was unclear how this commitment from the Group <span>of 7 went</span> beyond existing undertakings, if at all. The 27-nation European Union has already committed to a complete import ban on all Russian oil, with most countries phasing out Russian crude oil within six months and refined oil by the end of the year."

Speaking on Saturday in Washington, he said Mr. Putin was “in a frame of mind that he thinks he cannot afford to lose,” and was convinced that “doubling down still will enable him to make progress.” In <span>the 77 years</span> since the end of World War II, the possibility of a broad conflagration in Europe has seldom, if ever, appeared more plausible.

34811_1,"American Conservative Union President Matt Schlapp hosted a conversation with White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House strategist Steve Bannon on Thursday at CPAC 2017. Priebus began by declaring that President Trump, who will also speak at CPAC, would become known as “one of the greatest presidents that ever served this country.” Schlapp noted that Trump will also be the first president to address CPAC during his first year in office since Ronald Reagan <span>in 1981,</span> and he congratulated Trump for assembling “the most conservative Cabinet we’ve ever seen, according to our CPAC ratings.” When Schlapp asked for the “biggest misconception about what’s going on in the Donald Trump White House,” Priebus replied: “In regard to us two, I think the biggest misconception is everything that you’re reading.” Priebus and Bannon said that contrary to media reports about friction between them, they’re working very well together. “It’s actually something that you all helped build,” Priebus told the audience."
34811_2,"“When you bring together, and what this election showed, and what President Trump showed — and let’s not kid ourselves, I mean I can talk about data and ground game, and Steve can talk about big ideas, but the truth of the matter is, Donald Trump, President Trump brought together the party and the conservative movement.” The President’s chief of staff went on to say, prompting a burst of applause: And I’ve got to tell you, if the party and the conservative movement are together — similar to Steve and I — it can’t be stopped. And President Trump was the one guy, he was the one person — and I can say it after <span>overseeing 16 people</span> kill each other — it was Donald Trump that was able to bring this party and this movement together. Steve and I know that, and we live it every day."
34811_3,"“A lot of people have strong beliefs about different things, but we understand that you can come together to win, and we understood that from August 15th,” Bannon said. “We never had a doubt, and Donald Trump never had a doubt that he was going to win.” Priebus and Bannon both emphasized how much of Trump’s agenda is clearly laid out in his speeches, going all the way back to his appearance at <span>CPAC 2011.</span> “What all of us were starving for the whole time, because we’re so sick of politics and politicians — in spite of the fact that we love being here, we actually hate politics — but what we were starving for was somebody real,” Priebus contended."
34811_7,"“I”m personally so conditioned to hearing about why President Trump isn’t going to win the election, why a controversy in the primary is going to take down President Trump; I lived through it as chairman of the party,” he said, recalling his time as chairman of the Republican National Committee during the 2016 election. “It really hit me because it was maybe the summer <span>of 2015,</span> and you remember the media was constantly pounding President Trump, and the polling kept getting better and better for President Trump. But it was when I went home and got out of this town, and I went back to Kenosha, and I talked to my neighbor."
