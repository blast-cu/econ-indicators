This helps explain why median sales prices have fallen by only about 7 percent, from a June high <span>of $413,800 to</span> $384,800 in September — and were still up year-over-year. Of course, that 7 percent decline might be a good deal if interest rates fall back to where they were fairly quickly."

Homeowners are presumably aware that mortgage rates have spiked, thanks to the Federal Reserve Board’s aggressive policy, <span>topping 7 percent</span> in the latest report from Freddie Mac. And because owners already have homes and mortgages, they are also aware that when rates are higher, people cannot afford to pay as much for houses."
