They are betting that the tiny apartments—generally the size of a hotel room for about half the rent of a full-size apartment—will attract young professionals and recent college graduates, helping to revitalize city centers."

The U.S. intelligence assessment that referendums could be held as soon as this weekend has led many observers in Ukraine, Washington and Brussels to suspect that Russia is attempting to create a bulwark against a long-expected Ukrainian counteroffensive by annexing territory and solidifying Russian control on the ground."
