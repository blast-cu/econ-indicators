88455_4,"Bowing to public pressure, Hong Kong’s lawmakers decided to postpone the debate of the bill. Hanging over the current tensions is the legacy of the Umbrella Movement, the mass pro-democracy protest in 2014 that occupied Hong Kong’s main commercial district <span>for 79 days</span>. Despite galvanizing a new generation of young activists, it achieved little in the way of political change."
88455_0,"It’s always been easy to prophesy Hong Kong’s doom. Ever since Britain handed over the bustling colonial entrepôt to Beijing <span>in 1997,</span> prognosticators and politicos of all stripes warned of its inexorable decline. Hong Kong’s liberal and quasi-democratic traditions, including civil liberties such as freedom of speech, would wane and wither under the new Communist overlords, they said."
88455_1,"The legislation’s proponents insist that current legal loopholes — Hong Kong does not have extradition treaties with China or Taiwan — need to be closed. But its critics argue that the bill fundamentally threatens the “one country, two systems” model that has enabled Hong Kong to maintain a degree of political autonomy <span>since 1997.</span> Permitting extraditions to the mainland, they contend, would enable China’s authoritarian leadership to further erode the rule of law and civil liberties in Hong Kong."

Still, it will not be hard for the peace deal’s detractors, led by powerful former president Álvaro Uribe, to depict the guarantee <span>of 10 unelected</span> legislative seats as an unconscionable freebie. Colombians who know FARC leaders from grainy “wanted” posters and jungle videos may have trouble accepting them as respectable lawmakers."
