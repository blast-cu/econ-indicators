Those pitchers, Lerner reasoned, had accomplished more than Strasburg, who had yet to win more <span>than 15 games</span> in a season and who had tossed more than 200 innings just once. Boras showed him the recent contracts of the game’s best pitchers — Clayton Kershaw, Scherzer, Zack Greinke, all Cy Young winners — and told him to think more along those lines."

In the United States, manufacturing wages adjusted for productivity have risen less <span>than 30 percent</span> since 2004, to $22.32 an hour, according to the consulting firm. And the higher wages for American workers are offset by lower natural gas prices, as well as inexpensive cotton and local tax breaks and subsidies."

A study of nearly 1,800 sex offenders across four states found that only 10% reoffended in the decade after their release from prison — far lower than <span>the 83% recidivism</span> rate for parolees convicted of other crimes. Not only are registered sex offenders relatively unlikely to reoffend, but the registries themselves appear to have no effect whatsoever on recidivism rates."

Despite child sexual abuse declining <span>by 60% between</span> 1992 and 2010, states continue to legislate as if lenient sex offender laws are a national emergency. And, like so many other corners of the criminal justice system, the crackdown hasn’t affected all Americans equally."

Ever since the dual 1970s oil crises, energy security officials have fretted about a deliberate strike on one of the critical choke points of energy production and transport."
