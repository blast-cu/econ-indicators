But all we do is open ourselves up to criticism and make ourselves look bad.” As economists and trade analysts sorted through <span>the 1,800</span>-plus pages of the new accord, they saw few signs of major change. Lorenzo Caliendo, an economics professor at Yale University’s School of Management who co-authored a NAFTA study published in 2015 that concluded each American had gained about $45 a year from that treaty, said the new agreement would “clearly not” return significant numbers of manufacturing jobs to the United States."

While some industries and regions would fare better than others, the sheer size of <span>the $20 trillion</span> U.S. economy will probably swamp those specific effects. The accord, which the president has christened the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, would require automobiles to include more North American parts to qualify for duty-free treatment, pry open a sliver of Canada’s dairy market and update trading rules for the Internet economy."

One recent federal report estimated there was <span>a 40 percent</span> “uncertainty of flood predictions.” In 2015, in its highly technical 180-page challenge to FEMA’s proposed new maps, the city argued that the federal agency had overstated the base flood elevation — the height of flooding that might be expected in a 100-year flood — by two feet in some areas. FEMA also inflated the flood zone area by a third, the city claimed, “unnecessarily putting approximately 26,000 buildings and 170,000 residents” in higher-risk locations and “causing an affordability challenge.” In March, at the city’s request, the RAND Corporation detailed the maps’ potential impact in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island."
