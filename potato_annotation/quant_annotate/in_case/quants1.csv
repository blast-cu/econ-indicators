The S&<span>P 500 is</span> by design not comprehensive, including only big stocks, but if it can exclude such a huge company as Tesla, what is it for? The answer, according to S&P’s website, is that it “is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities.” In the world of investment, that is pretty much all there is: If everyone uses the S&P as the benchmark, you have to pay attention."

Previously, the Swiss were obligated to continuously purchase unlimited quantities of Euros to maintain <span>the 1.20 peg</span> that they decided to implement back in September of 2011. Interestingly, this Euro/Franc peg coincided with the nominal high in gold prices, as the world feared that there were increasingly smaller places to park safe money."

On Sept.<span> 14,</span> 1989, a disgruntled employee entered the Standard Gravure printing plant in downtown Louisville and, armed with an AK-47 and other guns, killed eight and wounded 12 others before taking his own life — in what remains the deadliest mass shooting in the state’s history. At the time, mass shootings had not yet become the staple of American life that they are now, and McConnell said he was “deeply disturbed,” declaring, “We must take action to stop such vicious crimes.”  But he also added: “We need to be careful about legislating in the middle of a crisis.” And in the days and weeks after, he did not join others in calling for a ban on assault weapons like the AK-47 used by the shooter."
