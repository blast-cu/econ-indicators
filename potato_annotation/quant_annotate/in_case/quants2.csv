The yuan can then <span>trade 2 percent</span> higher or lower than that central rate. While experts said some of the criticism could be wide of the mark, the People’s Bank of China may now have a tough job on its hands to prevent the currency's decline from spiraling."

A few weeks later, China’s economic data — showing growth steady <span>at 7 percent</span> despite widespread signs of a slowdown — were widely derided by analysts as inaccurate and overblown. Now, fresh concerns have surfaced about the stewardship of the central bank after a shock decision to allow market forces to play a greater role in setting exchange rates."

How many people will leave the country?” Abandoning price tags Argentines are hoping the current moment does not spiral into a disaster <span>like 2001,</span> when there was a run on the banks. That year, it became clear that foreign investors believed the Argentine peso was worth far less than the government’s official rate, and Argentines rushed to get their money before it was lost."

The Group <span>of 7 statement</span> included a series of economic, military and judicial steps, with the apparent aim of bringing the Russian economy to its knees and increasing the pressure on Mr. Putin to turn back from a war of choice that has turned him into a pariah and threatens much of his country’s progress over the past two decades. “We commit to phase out our dependency on Russian energy, including by phasing out or banning the import of Russian oil,” the statement said."

Putin pursued his indiscriminate bombardment of eastern Ukraine and orchestrated celebrations for Russia’s Victory Day holiday on Monday. A statement by the Group <span>of 7 major</span> industrialized nations said that on a day when Europe recalled the devastation of World War II and its millions of victims, including those from the Soviet Union, Mr. Putin’s “actions bring shame on Russia and the historic sacrifices of its people.” The leaders, signaling to Mr. Putin that their unrelenting support of Ukraine would only grow, said, “We remain united in our resolve that President Putin must not win his war against Ukraine.” The memory of all those who fought for freedom in World War II, the statement said, obliged them “to continue fighting for it today.” The tone was firm, with no mention of any potential diplomacy or cease-fire. In Moscow, as fighter jets streaked across the sky and nuclear weapons were put on display in preparation for Victory Day, Mr. Putin appeared to signal back to Western leaders that he was determined to double down on the war until he could conjure something that might be claimed as victory."
